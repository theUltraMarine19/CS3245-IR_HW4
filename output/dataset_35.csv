YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 Introduction
This was an appeal against the decision of the district judge in the subordinate court. He convicted the appellant on two amended charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and sentenced him to nine months` imprisonment on each charge (the sentences on the two charges to run concurrently). The appellant appealed only against the conviction.
 2.
 The first charge
The appellant was charged under s 420 of the Penal Code with cheating one Ho Ah Lek (Ho) on 12 March 1996 by falsely representing to him that his brother Ong Heng Huat was the owner of motorcar bearing registration number SBX 1974 H and that he had the authority of his brother to sell the said motorcar when in actual fact he had no such authority to sell the car. By such manner of deception, he dishonestly induced Ho to deliver to him cash amounting to $40,000 being the deposit for the purported sale of the car, which Ho would not have done, had he not been so deceived.
 3.
 The facts
The appellant was an undischarged bankrupt. He was in dire need of money and tried to borrow it from his childhood friend, one Yew Seow Leong (Yew). Yew could not lend him the money. Yew brought the appellant to see his friend Ho. Ho had been a used car dealer since 1990 with an office at Aljunied Used Car Centre. The appellant and Yew went there in a white Mercedes Benz SBX 1974 H (the car) which was registered in the name of the appellant`s brother Ong Heng Huat (DW2).
 4.There was a divergence of versions of what transpired at Ho`s office. According to Ho, the appellant wanted to sell the car for $50,000 but this was bargained down by him to $40,000. Ho went on with the deal as the appellant told him that his brother had asked him to sell the car as the brother was abroad and too busy to do so himself. Ho asked the appellant for the log book but was told by the appellant that it was in the appellant`s office and he would give the log book to Ho later. Ho stated that he would not have parted with the $40,000 if he had known that the appellant had no authority to sell the car.
 5.The appellant however claimed that he had gone with Yew to Ho to borrow $40,000. After talking to Yew, Ho agreed to lend him the $40,000. Ho then asked the appellant to sign a form D3. The appellant claimed that Ho did not ask for any security or the log book or whether the appellant was the owner of the car but just handed over the $40,000. The appellant claimed that the $40,000 was a loan with interest at 10% to be paid on 12 April 1996. The appellant then paid the $4,000 interest on 12 April 1996 and asked for an extension of time to pay back the loan in full. The appellant had no receipt for this payment of interest. He claimed that he had not asked for a receipt as it was interest and not the full sum and besides, it was unofficial money lending. This was vehemently denied by Ho.
 6.The log book was never given to Ho and he made a police report. Before the report was made, the appellant called Ho repeatedly to ask Ho not to report the matter to the police and to tell Ho that he was unable to give Ho the car. Ho had recorded 10 listings of the phone calls received (P5). Sometime in April 1996, Ho had gone to DW2`s office to look for the appellant and his brother and was told by DW2 that the appellant had no car to sell. Subsequently, sometime after the report was made, the appellant paid PW1 $20,000 as part settlement. An acknowledgement of this part payment (P7) was signed between the parties. Ho stated that he did not read and write English. P7 was given to him by the appellant who explained to him the contents.
 7.
 The second charge
The appellant was also charged with cheating one Lim Choon Hwee on 8 March 1996, by deceiving him into believing that he intended to sell his car bearing registration number SBX 1974H at a price of $59,000 to him when in actual fact, he had no such intention, and by such manner of deception, he dishonestly induced the said Lim Choon Hwee, to deliver to him cash amounting to $25,000 being the deposit for the purported sale of the car, which he would not have done, had he not been so deceived. He was also charged under s 420 of the Penal Code.
 8.
 The facts
The events in the second charge preceded the events in the first charge. On 8 March 1996, the appellant contacted Lim Choon Hee (Lim) who was another used car dealer. The appellant only vaguely knew Lim but nevertheless contacted him to ask for a loan. They met at the appellant`s residence - 729 Mountbatten Road where there were two Mercedes cars parked. After some discussion, the parties came to an arrangement whereby Lim agreed to buy one of the Mercedes Benz (SBX 1974H). Lim gave the appellant a deposit of $25,000 and the appellant agreed to persuade the registered owner of the car to sell the car to Lim for $59,000. If he could not do so after two weeks, he would have to repay Lim the money as well as an additional $2,000. According to PW2, a deposit voucher for the $25,000 was signed. However, he stated that he did not have it any longer as the voucher was torn up in front of the appellant and his mother DW3. Lim stated that he would not have paid the appellant the money if he had known that the appellant had no authority to commit the sale to him.
 9.Subsequently, the appellant contacted Lim and informed him that he (the appellant) would not be able to go through with the sale. The appellant gave Lim a cheque for $27,000 (P8) in repayment. However, the cheque was dishonoured. Lim then made a police report. After the police report was made, the appellant`s mother paid Lim the sum of $25,000.
 10.
 The decision below
The district judge found the appellant`s evidence on the first charge to be unbelievable. He found that Ho did not know the appellant and therefore it was highly unlikely that he would have lent money to the appellant, especially when the appellant was a bankrupt. Further, he found it unlikely that the appellant had driven the car to Ho who was a used car dealer if he had just wanted to borrow money.
 11.The district judge accepted the version given by Ho and was satisfied that he was a truthful witness.
 12.The district judge also found that the appellant had no intention of selling the car to Lim. He found that if the appellant had really the intention of selling the car to PW2, he would not have approached PW1 a few days later offering to sell the car to PW1.
 13.The district judge also considered the evidence of the appellant that he tried to persuade his brother DW2 to sell the car to Lim and found this to be untrue. DW2 had testified that he had not spoken to his brother after they quarrelled.
 14.The district judge found the defence to be a denial and rejected it as the evidence suggested otherwise. He found the irresistible inference to be that the appellant was in dire need of money and used the car as a convenient cash cow to deceive.
 15.The district judge found the defence witnesses to be of no help to the appellant. The evidence of DW2, he found to be more helpful to the prosecution than to the defence. He also found DW3 (the appellant`s mother) to be partial to the appellant and did not feel that her evidence shed any light on the representations made by the appellant.
 16.Accordingly, the district judge found the appellant guilty and convicted him on both charges.
 17.
 Issues arising in the appeal
The appellant appealed against the decision of the district judge. For the sake of clarity, both charges will be taken separately. In the event of overlap in any issues however, they will then be considered together.
 (A) No prima facie case
 18.The main ground of appeal was that the district judge erred in law and in fact in failing to find that, at the close of the prosecution`s case, the prosecution had failed to satisfy the 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 test, in that it had not made out a case against the appellant, which, if unrebutted, would warrant the appellant`s conviction on both charges and thereby should have acquitted the appellant of both charges without calling upon the appellant to enter upon his defence.
 19.In my opinion, this ground was tenuous. At the stage when the prosecution closed its case, the prosecution only had to ensure that it had adduced evidence which was `not inherently incredible and which, if it were accepted as accurate, would establish each essential element` in the offence charged: 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  [1980-1981] SLR 73 . Here, the elements of the first charge were that the appellant had tried to sell the car, that he had induced Ho to believe that he was authorised to sell the car; that but for such belief Ho would not have paid the $40,000; that Ho did pay this sum; that the appellant did not in fact have the authority to sell the car; and that he intended to deceive Ho in that he knew that he had no such authority.
 20.The evidence at the close of the prosecution case was that the appellant had gone along with his friend to Ho`s workplace to sell the car. Ho stated in his examination-in-chief that the appellant had told him that he was selling the car on behalf of his (the appellant`s) brother who was too busy to do so himself. He also stated that he would not have paid the $40,000 if he had not believed that the appellant had authority to sell the car. The evidence showed that the car was registered in the name of the appellant`s brother Ong Heng Huat. Further, the evidence showed that the appellant did not go through with the sale and could not repay the $40,000.
 21.Similarly, for the second charge, the elements that had to be proved were as above. Lim stated in his examination-in-chief that he gave the appellant $25,000 as deposit for the purchase of the car. He believed that the appellant had the authority to sell the car, and he would not have paid the appellant the money if he knew that the appellant had no authority to commit the sale. Again, the appellant did not go through the sale and did not pay back the $25,000.
 22.At the conclusion of the prosecution case, the evidence was that the appellant had offered to sell the motorcar to two separate persons in the space of four days and had taken sums of $40,000 and $25,000 as deposits. After that, the appellant did not go through with the sale and had difficulty paying back the deposits.
 23.In both the charges, the obvious inference to be drawn was that, not only did the appellant not have the authority to sell the car, but also he had no intention of selling the car. A trial court is entitled to draw inferences from the facts. At the close of the case for the prosecution, the inference need only be reasonable: 
PP v Liew Kim Choo
 
[1997] 2 SLR 443
 . As such, the prosecution had satisfied the test in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 in that a prima facie case had been made out.
 24.Further, in the cross examination of the appellant`s brother, he had testified that he had not given the appellant authority to sell the car. Therefore, there was no miscarriage of justice in the conviction of the appellant on the two charges on which he was tried.
 (B) PW1`s evidence
 25.Another ground of appeal was that the district judge erred in fact in accepting Ho`s evidence as consistent and believable when he had given two different versions of the transaction in P4 and P7. In my opinion, this ground was tenuous. The judge as the trier of fact had observed both the appellant and Ho. He had decided that Ho was a credible witness. The Court of Appeal in 
Ng Soo Hin v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 105
  held that an appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judge`s findings and his reasons therefor.
 26.Here, Ho had explained that he did not author the acknowledgment of part payment (P7). He could neither read nor write English. P7 was prepared by the appellant in advance and he had merely signed it. He did this in order to get his money back. Therefore, there was nothing inconsistent between P4 and P7. As such, there was nothing that prevented the district judge from holding that Ho`s evidence was consistent and believable.
 (C) DW3`s evidence
 27.The appellant further appealed on the ground that the district judge failed to give sufficient consideration or at all to the evidence of DW3 who confirmed that she told the appellant that DW2 had agreed to sell the car and therefore gave the appellant the impression that he could procure the sale of the car to Lim.
 28.The district judge had indeed considered the evidence of DW3 but had considered her to be a not helpful witness in that she was partial to the appellant. In my opinion, the district judge was correct in not giving the evidence of DW3 much weight. Further, if the appellant had been sincere about selling the car to PW2, he would not then have approached Ho so soon after that transaction and tried to sell the same car to him.
 (D) The calls to Ho
 29.Another ground of appeal by the appellant was that the district judge erred in fact and in law in failing to appreciate that, if the appellant had the intention to cheat, he would not have kept calling Ho about the matter.
 30.In my opinion the calls to Ho did not show his lack of intention to cheat. According to the testimony of Ho, the purpose of the calls was to tell Ho that the appellant was unable to give him the car and to plead with Ho not to call the police about the matter after Ho had told the appellant that he was going to make a police report. As such, they merely showed the appellant`s fear that Ho would go to the police about the matter and did not show that he had no intention whatsoever to cheat.
 31.Further, it had to be noted that the offence of cheating was complete when Ho and Lim delivered the respective sums of $40,000 and $25,000 to the appellant. Whatever the appellant later did to deter Ho and Lim was not relevant and the district judge was right in not considering the matter of the phone calls in relation to the intention of the appellant.
 32.
 Conclusion
In my opinion, the appeal ought to be dismissed. The main issue in this case was one of which version of facts to be believed. The district judge had set out in his grounds of decision the reasons why he believed Ho and Lim over the appellant. He had observed their demeanour and had found the appellant to be untruthful and Ho and Lim to be credible witnesses. He had found the story that the appellant had borrowed the money from Ho and Lim unbelievable.
 33.In my opinion the district judge was correct in holding thus. Both Ho and Lim`s circumstances were strikingly similar. Both claimed that they had an agreement with the appellant to buy the car, and had paid the deposit, following which the appellant had defaulted on the sale. Unless both Ho and Lim were in collusion, and there was no suggestion of this, it was a coincidence that both of them were involved with the appellant over the sale of the same motorcar. This led to the conclusion that the appellant had intended to cheat them.
 34.The appellant had claimed that the money given by Ho was a loan and that he had paid interest of $4,000 on 12 April 1996. However, no evidence of this payment was ever adduced to the district judge.
 35.Also, in both cases, Ho and Lim were aware that the appellant was an undischarged bankrupt. Both of them were also only mere acquaintances of the appellant. In my opinion, under such circumstances, it was very unlikely that both Ho and Lim would have lent him such sums of money without any security.
 36.In my opinion the appellant had approached Ho and Lim and misrepresented to them in turn that he had the authority to sell the car and wanted to sell it, when this was not the case. He intended to deceive Ho and Lim into handing over the deposits which they did. In doing so, he committed in each case the offence of cheating.
 37.For all the above reasons the appeal was dismissed.",1998-04-30 00:00:00,SG High Court

 The petitioner was charged as follows: 
You, Lim Hean Nerng, male (NRIC No S0022235/F) are charged that you, on 17 February 1997 at about 9.30am at No 44 Sungei Kadut Street 1, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Lim Ee Choo, m/70 yrs, to wit, by punching him on the right side of the face, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 2.In the court below, the petitioner was convicted and fined $500, two week`s imprisonment in default of payment. The petitioner paid the fine. Subsequently the petitioner made a petition of criminal revision asking the court to exercise its power of revision under s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to reverse the conviction. At the end of the hearing I dismissed the petition for the following reasons.
 3.
 The respondent`s version of events
The respondent Mr Lim Ee Choo (the respondent), is the managing partner of Chye Lian Huat Sawmill Co (the company). On 17 February 1997 at about am, he was at the premises of the company at No 44 Sungei Kadut Street 1 (the premises). At the premises he saw that the workers were doing work for the petitioner. A dispute arose as to the use of the workers. According to the respondent, the petitioner raised his hand and punched him on the right side of the face. There was no witness to the punch. The respondent then went into his office and asked his clerk, Mr Chew Guan San to call for the police. The police arrived at about 9.40am. They found no visible sign of injury on the respondent. They advised the respondent that if he wanted to pursue the matter further, he had to seek medical treatment and subsequently register the case at the subordinate courts.
 4.At about 2pm of the same day, the respondent went to the A & E Department of Toa Payoh Hospital. Dr Yeo Suan Aik (Dr Yeo) examined him. Dr Yeo found that there was no bruise over the right maxilla. There was however tenderness on touch over the right maxilla. In other words, the respondent felt pain on his right cheek upon touch. In his evidence, Dr Yeo verified that there was no clinical way to measure tenderness and that it depended on the patient`s response. He could not say for certain what caused the injury. He opined that it was possible for the injury to be caused by a punch, to be self-inflicted or faked. He stated that in cases where pretence was suspected, he would routinely lightly touch the skin and look for a hypersensitive response which was inconsistent to the injury where no physical bruise was seen. He stated that he did not observe any signs of pretence in the respondent`s case.
 5.The respondent subsequently made a police report on 19 February 1997. On 18 June 1997, he made a complaint against the petitioner under s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, alleging that the petitioner punched him on the right side of his face.
 6.
 The petitioner`s version of events
According to the petitioner, he had been appointed by five of the seven partners of the company to help in the management and repair work. On 17 February 1997 the petitioner went to the premises of the company and directed the workers to clear the rubbish and repair the fence. When the respondent arrived, he asked the petitioner not to interfere with the vacant land and the factory premises. He only wanted the petitioner to collect arrears of rental from the tenants. An argument ensued and the respondent ordered the petitioner to leave the premises immediately, failing which he would call the police.
 7.The argument carried on and the police arrived. The police asked the petitioner if he had authorisation to work on the premises. The petitioner showed the police a contract signed by five partners of the company. After speaking with the respondent, the police asked the petitioner to ask the workers to stop work immediately. The petitioner explained to the police that the workers were casual workers and that it would be easier to account for their salary if they worked for at least half a day. The police then spoke to the respondent. The respondent went back into the office and the petitioner carried on with his work. The petitioner`s defence to the charge was that he did not punch the respondent nor come into contact with his body in any way.
 8.
 The trial judge`s decision
The trial judge found the petitioner guilty as to the charge. Since the petitioner had proceeded by way of petition of criminal revision instead of filing a notice of appeal within ten days of the judgment, there was no statutory requirement on the trial judge to produce grounds of decision. In evaluating the petition, the notes of evidence were relied on.
 9.
 The delay in presenting the petition
The principle relating to the exercise of the court`s power of revision was laid out in 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
 . The principle is that there must be some serious injustice in the circumstances before the court`s revisionary power is exercised. The point was also made there that while in a case of injustice generally, delay would not be material, it may indicate in some circumstances that there is in fact no injustice caused. On the facts of that case, the court was of the view that the delay of about eight months indicated that even if there was injustice, the force of that was seriously attenuated by the delay, such that no exercise of the discretion ought to be made in favour of the petitioner.
 10.In the present case, there was a considerable delay of about five months before the petition was presented. The proper procedure for the present case should have been to file a notice of appeal within ten days of the judgment which was given on 6 October 1997. The petition for criminal revision was filed on 11 March 1998. The reason given for the delay was this. The respondent took out an originating summons in the High Court to dissolve the company. On 31 December 1997, the respondent filed an affidavit which implied that there was a connection between the petitioner`s conviction on 6 October 1997 and the assault on the respondent on 10 March 1997 by unknown persons. The petition was allegedly taken so as to protect the petitioner from further private summonses and criminal charges. I am of the view that the petitioner has not adequately explained the delay. The petition itself was filed two and a half months after the affidavit was filed by the respondent. Furthermore it has not been explained how a criminal revision with regards to the petitioner`s conviction will protect him from further private summonses or criminal charges. The considerable delay in presenting the petition, and the failure to adequately explain the delay have undermined the force of the injustice, if any.
 11.
 The petition
The petitioner contended that serious injustice was suffered as the petitioner was convicted on weak and inadequate evidence. He was essentially contending that the trial judge erred in fact in finding that the petitioner punched the respondent and that the respondent had failed to prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt. The general principle laid down by the Court of Appeal in 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
  is that: 
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence an appellate court has always to bear in mind it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor.
 12.The weight of the evidence for the respondent lay in his direct evidence, his calling of the police immediately after the alleged punch, and the evidence of Dr Yeo that there was tenderness on his right maxilla and his failure to observe any signs of pretence. Examining the evidence on the whole, it cannot be said that the trial judge`s finding of facts were clearly against the weight of the evidence.
 13.The first point raised by the petitioner was that it was not inconceivable that the respondent made a false police report so that the petitioner would not have time to interfere with the partnership business. This point is neither here nor there. All that the petitioner is saying is that it is possible that the police report is false. In order to show that the police report is false, the petitioner would have to show that the petitioner did not punch the respondent. Therefore to say that it is conceivable that the police report was false is the equivalent of saying that it is conceivable that the petitioner did not punch the respondent. However, that was the very issue which had to be decided at trial, and to make a point such as that raised does not add anything to the petitioner`s case.
 14.The second point raised in the petition of criminal revision was that the petitioner was standing opposite the respondent and his alleged right hand punch should have landed on the left side of the respondent`s face instead of the right. The petitioner`s contention was that for the right hand to punch the left side of the respondent`s face, the petitioner`s right arm would have had to contort at an awkward angle. The short answer to this is that it was not established that the petitioner used his right hand to punch the respondent. In answer to the question of whether the petitioner used his left or right hand to punch him, the respondent`s reply under cross-examination was that at that point of time he did not pay attention. Furthermore, even if the petitioner used his right hand, it would have been possible for him to punch the respondent on the left cheek without contorting his arm.
 15.The third point raised by the petitioner was that the respondent did not suffer any bruises or bleeding. However there is no requirement of bruising or bleeding in order for an offence under s 321 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) to be committed. Hurt is defined in s 319 of the Penal Code as including bodily pain. The tenderness on touch over the right maxilla of the respondent would be sufficient to constitute bodily pain for the purposes of s 319 of the Penal Code.
 16.The petitioner also made the point that a punch delivered by a 40 plus year old man like the petitioner would have resulted in greater injury to the 71 year old respondent than a mere tenderness over right maxilla. However, the extent of the respondent`s injuries depended on the force of the punch, the distance between the parties, whether the punch was a direct hit, and the strength and agility of the respondent in warding off the blow. Furthermore there was evidence from Dr Yeo that in his one and a half years of posting at the A & E Department, he had seen about ten cases where the patient claimed to have been punched on the right maxilla and the injury in some of those cases had been similar to the one in the present case. The evidence of Dr Yeo indicates that the degree of injury suffered by the respondent upon being punched is not as `inherently incredible` as the petitioner claims.
 17.The fourth point raised by the petitioner is that the respondent had at least three hours between the time of the alleged punch and the visit to the doctor to inflict self-injury. There are two points I would like to make in response to this. Firstly, it is a settled principle of law that where a trial judge makes a finding of fact based on the credibility of the witnesses whom he has had the opportunity to see and assess, an appellate court can reverse the trial judge`s decision only if it is convinced that it is wrong, and not merely where it entertains doubts as to whether the decision is right; 
PP v Poh Oh Sim
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 416
  
[1990] SLR 1047
 . In convicting the petitioner, the trial judge must have found that the injury of the respondent was not self-inflicted. Examining the notes of evidence, it cannot be said that the trial judge was clearly wrong in making this finding of fact.
 18.The second point is this. I do not deny that it was possible for the respondent to inflict self-injury during the time stated, in fact it was also possible that the respondent banged into a wall or that his wife hit him. However such points merely go into the realm of wild speculation and does nothing for the petitioner`s case. The petitioner contention was that the existence of such possibilities meant that the respondent had not proven his case beyond a reasonable doubt. I was unable to agree with this. The classic statement on the meaning of the criminal standard of proof is that of Denning J (as he then was) in 
Miller v Minister of Pensions
 
[1947] 2 All ER 372
 where he said: 
Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence `of course it is possible, but not in the least probable,` the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.
 In the present case, the speculation thrown up by the petitioner amounted to nothing more than a fanciful and remote possibility and was insufficient to cast a reasonable doubt on the respondent`s case.
 19.A further issue which was raised at trial but which was not raised in the petition of criminal revision was the applicability of s 95 of the Penal Code. Section 95 states that nothing is an offence by reason that it causes harm that is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. The petitioner relied on the case of 
Teo Geok Fong v Lim Eng Hock
 [1996] 2 SLR 431 . That case however can be distinguished in that the harm was caused by a slap as compared to the punch in the present case. The victim in that case did not suffer any scratch or mark on his left cheek and did not bother to seek medical attention. Furthermore, the slap arose out of a matrimonial dispute and the victim was found to be partly responsible in provoking the slap.
 20.For the reasons given above, I found no basis to overturn the trial judge`s findings of fact. I was also satisfied that the offence was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The petition was accordingly dismissed.",1998-05-12 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
LIM TEONG QWEE JC
 On 27 July 1994 the plaintiff granted an option in writing to purchase the property at 62 Burn Rd for $11.5m. The option was exercised by the first defendant and the sale was completed on 28 November 1994 when the balance of the purchase price was paid to the plaintiff and the transfer of the property was delivered to the first defendant. In this action commenced by writ issued more than a year later on 5 January 1996 the plaintiff claims against the first defendant the amount of the Goods and Services Tax (`GST`) `leviable on the sale of the property`. The plaintiff also claims against the second defendant the amount of the GST as damages for negligence as the estate agent of the plaintiff. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth defendants together with Yap Chee Leong (deceased) were partners in the firm of Seah Yap Leong & Partners and the claim against them is also for the amount of the GST as damages for negligence as the plaintiff`s solicitors. In the third party proceedings the second defendant claims an indemnity or alternatively contribution against the third party. At the conclusion of the trial on 13 January 1998 I dismissed the plaintiff`s claims against all the defendants. I also dismissed the second defendant`s claim against the third party. These are the grounds of my judgment.
 2.
 GST 
 
Section 7 of the Goods and Services Tax Act provides for GST to be charged on the supply of goods and services in Singapore. By virtue of s 11 and the Second Schedule the `grant, assignment or surrender of any interest in or right over land or of any licence to occupy land` is a supply of goods. Section 8(1) provides: 
Tax shall be charged on any supply of goods ... made in Singapore where it is a taxable supply made by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of any business carried on by him.
 Section 8(2) provides: 
A person is a taxable person for the purposes of this Act while he is or is required to be registered under this Act.
 Section 8(2A) provides: 
A taxable supply is a supply of goods or services made in Singapore other than an exempt supply.
 3.It was not in dispute that the plaintiff was registered under the Act and had been so registered since 1 April 1994 and was accordingly a taxable person and the grant or assignment of an interest in the property was a taxable supply as it was not an exempt supply under s 22 and the Fourth Schedule. Whether GST was chargeable depended on whether the taxable supply was made in the course or furtherance of any business carried on by the plaintiff.
 4.Section 8(3) provides: 
Tax on any supply of goods or services is a liability of the person making the supply ...
 It is the supplier who is liable to pay or to account for GST but it is of course open to the supplier and the buyer as the person to whom the taxable supply is made to make an agreement as between themselves as to which party is to pay GST. If there is an agreement that the buyer is to pay GST then subject to the terms of the agreement it seems to me that it has to be shown that the supplier is liable for GST. It has to be shown that GST is chargeable on the supply.
 5.
 Claim against the first defendant 
 
In the statement of claim it is alleged that the agreement for the sale of the property was partly in writing as evidenced by the option to purchase dated 27 July 1994 granted by the plaintiff and the acceptance dated 18 August 1994 signed by the first defendant. It is then alleged that `it was an oral term of the agreement` that the first defendant would bear the GST `leviable on the sale of the property` and that by his conduct in exercising the option the first defendant `accepted` the terms contained in the option and the oral term. The plaintiff`s case is that the oral term was `stipulated` by its Mr Loo to the second defendant`s Mr Seow at the point of time the option was granted and contemporaneously with it. There is also an allegation that it was an implied term of the agreement for sale that the `price quoted` was `exclusive of GST` and that such term was implied by the custom of the trade of selling commercial property. No evidence was adduced as to any such custom and this part of the case was abandoned.
 6.
 Oral term 
 
Mr Loo, a director of the plaintiff, said in his affidavit: 
At the point of granting the option on behalf of the plaintiffs, I expressly told Mr Allan Xiao in the presence of Ms Wuan that it was part of the agreement that the purchaser would bear the GST. Mr Allan Xiao told me that he would take care of that as the first defendant was similarly informed.
 It was not in dispute that the option was signed by Mr Loo and delivered to Mr Seow (or Xiao but I shall for convenience refer to him by the other name) on 27 July 1994 at the office of the plaintiff and that other than Mr Loo and Mr Seow the only person who was present then was Ms Wuan the proprietor of the third party.
 7.Under cross-examination Mr Loo said: 
Q: You noticed in option no GST clause? 
A: Yes. 
Q: You asked Allan Xiao to insert GST clause in option? 
A: No. 
Q: When you told him purchaser to bear GST? 
A: When we completed option. I mean I. By `completed` I mean signed. I mean after I signed option. 
Q: What exactly you told him? 
A: Can`t recall exactly what kind of words. Something to the effect that buyer shall pay GST. 
Q: Allan Xiao`s reply? 
A: Don`t have exact words he said. Something to the effect he accepted.`
 Down to the point of time he completed signing the option Mr Loo had not mentioned anything about GST. This was not disputed. If GST was chargeable it would have amounted to $345,000. It was not an insignificant sum. It was Mr Seow who prepared the option by writing in the particulars on a printed option form supplied by the second defendant. He did that as he, Mr Loo and Ms Wuan discussed and agreed the terms. Mr Loo read through the option after Mr Seow had prepared it and there was nothing about GST in it. He did not ask Mr Seow to write it in.
 8.Mr Seow said in his affidavit that he recalled `haggling` over the commission. The printed form provided for 2%. Mr Loo rejected that as being too high and eventually agreed to 1.2%. He had successfully brought it down by 0.8% or $92,000. Mr Seow said that the issue of GST was never raised or mentioned by anyone throughout the course of dealing. He was not cross-examined as to what Mr Loo had said in his affidavit and under cross-examination about the buyer having to pay GST.
 9.Ms Wuan said in her affidavit that on 27 July 1994 she was at the plaintiff`s office and met Mr Loo and Mr Seow. Mr Seow wrote the details in the second defendant`s standard option form and made some amendments. She said: 
After the details were filled in by Seow, he passed the option over to Loo who read the option form plus the handwritten amendments. About the time of signing the option form, Loo turned to Seow and remarked `Hey, the GST will be borne by the buyer you know` or words to that effect. Seow replied `I have informed the buyers` or words to that effect.`
 Under cross-examination Ms Wuan said: 
Q: When Mr Loo first mentioned about GST? 
A: Time of signing. I mean just before he signed. 
Q: Mr Loo`s exact words? 
A: Can`t remember exact words. All I remember he said `GST will be borne by buyer you know huh?` 
Q: Allan Xiao said? 
A: As far as I remember he said `I have informed buyer.` 
Q: That`s all he said? 
A: All that I can remember. 
Q: You said anything about GST? 
A: Not at all.
 Under further cross-examination Ms Wuan said that Mr Loo mentioned GST before he signed the option. It was the only time he had mentioned GST.
 10.The firm of Seah Yap Leong & Partners were instructed by the plaintiff after the option had been signed. The sale was due for completion 14 weeks after the option was exercised. It was exercised on 18 August 1994 and the completion date was accordingly 24 November 1994. On 18 November 1994 Seah Yap Leong & Partners wrote to the first defendant`s solicitors: 
We append below the completion account as follows:
 
Purchase price $11,500,000.00 
Less: 10% deposit $1,150,000 
$10,350,000.00 
Add: Apportionment of property tax from 25.11.94 to 31.12.94 [commat] $3121.25 per month: $3,745.50 
$10,353,745.50
 
On completion, please let us have the following cashier`s orders/firm`s cheque:
 
1 cashier`s order for 5,055,586.66 in favour of Industrial & Commercial Bank Limited; 
2 cashier`s order for $5,159,678.03 in favour of Challenger Technologies Pte Ltd; 
3 cashier`s order for $138,000 in favour of ERA Realty Network Pte Ltd; 
4 firm`s cheque for $275.16 in our favour; 
5 firm`s cheque for $205.65 in favour of Drew & Napier.
 A copy of this letter was given to the plaintiff. There are two observations to be made. The first is in regard to the statement of the price. There was no further sum to be paid for GST and there was no reference to GST at all. The second is in regard to the commission. The buyer was asked to give a separate cheque for $138,000 payable to the second defendant. This was for commission at 1.2% of $11.5m.
 11.Ms Ong, a partner of the firm and the solicitor who had the conduct of this matter, said in her affidavit: 
On the morning of 24 November 1994, I was informed by my conveyancing clerk that she received news from the conveyancing clerk at Ee Bin & Lau that there was a possibility that the first defendant would not be able to complete on that day.
 
Upon hearing the above, I contacted LT Loo to inform him of the news. In response, LT Loo said that he would like to come to Seah Yap Leong`s office to discuss the implications flowing from the first defendant`s failure to complete as scheduled.
 
Subsequent to the above telephone conversation, I had a meeting with LT Loo at approximately 11:45 am on the same day, ie 24 November 1994 at Seah Yap Leong`s office.
 
The matters discussed between LT Loo and I are set out in the Notes of Attendance that I took during the meeting.
 The attendance note stated: 
Seen clt.
 
1) Late completn by purchaser subj to late completn interest abt $2835.62 per day (Plse verify). 
2) Clts` instrs 
- to gv revised completn a/c 
- to pay all balance moneys, including clts`, to ICB so tt there`s no need to verify amt payable to mgee on completn 
3) to gv 21-day notice to complete to purchaser 
4) ERA commisn - to ask for exact figure + GST.
 12.In her affidavit Ms Ong said: 
LT Loo informed me that in the completion account sent to Ee Bin & Lau on 18 November 1994, the sum of $138,000 stated as payable to the second defendants was incorrect as it had failed to take into account the 3% GST payable to the second defendants which had to be included. LT Loo instructed me to reflect the correct figure in the revised completion account.
 She said that in acordance with Mr Loo`s instructions she wrote to the first defendant`s solicitors the same day: 
... we append below the revised completion account and mode of payment as follows :
 
Purchase price $11,500,000 
Less : 10% deposit $1,150,000.00 
$10,350,000.00 
Add: 1 Apportionment of property tax from 25.11.94 to 31.12.94 [commat] $3121.25 per month $3,745.50 
2 Interest for late completion from 25.11.94 to 28.11.94 [commat] $2835.62 per day $11,342.48 
$10,365,087.98
 
On completion, please let us have the following cashier`s orders/firm`s cheque:
 
1. cashier`s order for $10,222,467.17 in favour of Industrial & Commercial Bank Limited; 
2. cashier`s order for $142,140 in favour of ERA Realty Network Pte Ltd; 
3. firm`s cheque for $275.16 in our favour; 
4. firm`s cheque for $205.65 in favour of Drew & Napier.`
 A copy of this letter was also given to the plaintiff. The price is still stated to be $11.5m but the amount payable to the second defendant is now $142,140. This is the commission of 1.2% of $11.5m ($138,000) plus 3% for GST ($4,140). Ms Ong was not cross-examined on this part of her evidence.
 13.In her affidavit Ms Ong also said that when she attended Mr Loo on 24 November 1994 he neither raised the issue of the payment of GST on the sale of the property nor did he inform her that there was an agreement between the plaintiff and the first defendant that the first defendant would bear GST on the sale of the property. Under cross-examination she said she was aware GST was charged on the sale of the property but at no time did she initiate any discussion with Mr Loo on GST. Mr Loo himself said under cross-examination that when Ms Ong attended him on 24 November 1994 he did not discuss with her about GST on the sale of the property.
 14.The plaintiff`s business is dealing in computers and related products. GST was introduced in 1994 and the plaintiff was registered under the Act on 1 April 1994 on which day the Act came into force. Mr Loo was the chief executive of the plaintiff and when he signed the option for the sale of the property he would have known about GST. If he had intended that GST was to be paid by the buyer on the sale of the property in all likelihood he would have provided for it in the option. He would have asked for such provision to be written in if as Ms Wuan said he raised the subject before he signed the option. If he raised the subject after he had signed the option as he said he would have asked for an amendment to be made before he handed it to Mr Seow. The GST would have been $345,000 which was more than twice as much as the commission. I think Mr Loo did not mention anything to do with GST at all. He knew about GST but I think he did not know that GST was chargeable on the sale of the property.
 15.On 24 November 1994 when Mr Loo saw Ms Ong he gave instructions for a notice to complete to be given. He was taking an important step to enforce the plaintiff`s rights as seller of the property. He was aware that the completion account of 18 November 1994 made no provision for payment of GST. Interest for late completion was only about $2,800 per day but GST on the sale of the property would have been $345,000. He gave instructions for interest to be charged to the buyer and yet he said nothing about the $345,000 for GST which had not been mentioned in the completion account. I find it quite unbelievable that he would have said nothing about the $345,000 for GST if as alleged it had been agreed that the buyer would pay this. He could not have overlooked it. He gave instructions for the cheque to be paid for the commission to include GST on the commission.
 16.I find that Mr Loo did not mention GST on the sale of the property when the option to purchase was given or at any time at all until long after the sale was completed. In my judgment it was not a term of the agreement for the sale of the property by the plaintiff to the first defendant that the first defendant would bear the GST on the sale.
 17.
 Claim against the second defendant 
 
It is alleged in the statement of claim that the option was prepared by `the employees, servants and/or agents of the second defendant as estate agents of the plaintiff` and that the second defendant had been negligent. Five items of particulars of negligence are alleged against it including: 
(c) failing to use the option form with provisions stating that the purchaser would bear the GST on the sale of the property for this particular transaction. 
(d) failure to draw the plaintiffs` attention to their repeat omission.
 As to item (c) there was no evidence that the second defendant used or had available for use an option form with provision for the buyer to pay GST and no submission was made on this ground. Item (d) did not appear to be meaningful and it was not proceeded with.
 18.
 (1) Estate agent
Mr Loo said in his affidavit that he knew that Ms Wuan was an estate agent and he asked her `to help the plaintiff to help find a buyer for the property`. He said: 
[Ms Wuan] in turn brought in Mr Allan Xiao the associate director of the second defendants in this proceedings. I am aware that Ms Wuan and Mr Allan Xiao, associate director of the second defendants, agreed to co-broke the said property and to divide the commission of 1.2% of the purchase price amongst themselves. I dealt with Mr Allan Xiao once he came into the picture.
 Under cross-examination he said: 
Q: What she told you about Allan Xiao when she first brought him to see you? 
A: Told me Allan Xiao had ready buyers for property. 
Q: All? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Paragraph 9. Sentence 2. Who told you? Agreed to co-broke? 
A: Connee Wuan. 
Q: When? 
A: When she brought Allan Xiao to see me. 
Q: You know what `co-broking` means? 
A: Yes. 
Q: What? 
A: Both agents share commission among themselves. That`s all.
 Later he said: 
Q: At all times when you negotiated price you negotiated only with Allan Xiao? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Allan Xiao was negotiating on behalf of D1? 
A: Yes. 
Q: He acted as agent of D1? 
A: Yes.
 19.Ms Wuan said in her affidavit that she was to find a buyer for the property at $12.5m for which she would be paid 1% as commission and if she could secure a sale price close to $12.5m Mr Loo would consider giving her a better rate of commission. She passed the information around and in due course she met Mr Seow. Mr Seow said he might have buyers and later Ms Wuan agreed to `co-broke` with him on a 50:50 basis. Under cross-examination she said he told her he was representing an interested buyer.
 20.Mr Seow said in his affidavit that he had been acting as a `housing agent` for the first defendant since 1991 both selling and buying properties and in 1994 the first defendant had asked him to be on the lookout for good properties for investment. His budget was $20m. Acting on information received he called Ms Wuan. She agreed to `co-broke` with him. He obtained particulars of the property and the asking price from her. He referred to the first defendant and received instructions to bargain the price down to $11.5m.
 21.Both Ms Wuan and Mr Seow understood `co-broke` to mean that the parties would share the commission paid by the seller. It was clearly an arrangement between the two estate agents to share the commission although there may be cases of `co-broking` involving more than two estate agents. They would work towards the common objective of securing a buyer for the property to earn the commission. Ms Wuan was retained by the plaintiff 
 to find a buyer 
. In the absence of express authority from the plaintiff she could not entrust to the second defendant or Mr Seow the exercise of the power or duty entrusted to her by the plaintiff to find a buyer. 
 Delegatus non potest delegare 
. She did not do that. That was not the arrangement between Ms Wuan and Mr Seow. She did not ask Mr Seow to find a buyer. Mr Seow was representing a buyer. He was on the lookout for good properties for investment. When the transaction was completed Ms Wuan would have found a buyer. That was what she was retained by the plaintiff to do. Mr Seow would have found a property (or found a seller). That was in accordance with his retainer. He and the second defendant represented by him were not retained by the plaintiff to find a buyer. He was the representative of the buyer and Mr Loo knew that when he negotiated the price with him. Ms Wuan`s remuneration would come from the seller. That was what she earned for finding a buyer. She would share this with Mr Seow. That was in accordance with their arrangement.
 22.The option was given in the standard printed form of the second defendant. Mr Loo said in his affidavit that he wanted the plaintiff`s lawyers to prepare the option but he agreed to use the second defendant`s form. Ms Wuan said in her affidavit that Mr Seow told Mr Loo that the potential buyer was a long standing customer who had previously used the second defendant`s standard form and would be comfortable in using it and further that Mr Seow had added that the standard form was widely recognised by a large number of law firms. Mr Loo agreed with this under cross-examination although he said Mr Seow only said this on 27 July 1994 which was the day the option was signed. Mr Seow said in his affidavit that the choice of form was agreed between him and Ms Wuan. He said it was the privilege of the `listing agent` to decide on the form to use and in this case Ms Wuan was the `listing agent` and it was her privilege to decide and she decided to use the form that was actually used.
 23.The option could have been given in the form prepared by the plaintiff`s solicitors or in the form provided by Ms Wuan or by the buyer or his agent as in this case. The form could have been used by agreement between Mr Loo and Mr Seow or between Mr Seow and Ms Wuan. It did not matter. In fact it was used by agreement of all three of them as I find on the evidence. It did not alter the position that it was Ms Wuan whom the plaintiff appointed to find a buyer and it was Mr Seow as the agent of the buyer that Mr Loo negotiated the price and terms of sale with. Mr Seow also negotiated the amount of the commission. That was done by agreement with Ms Wuan or with her consent. Mr Seow had an interest in the commission under the `co-broking` arrangement he made with her. Mr Loo was aware of the `co-broking` arrangement. The commission was expressed to be payable to the second defendant under the option and that was also by agreement with or with the consent of Ms Wuan. In my judgment the second defendant was not the estate agent of the plaintiff as alleged in the statement of claim or at all.
 24.If there was any duty owed by the second defendant the plaintiff`s case as pleaded is that such duty was contractual and arose out of the appointment of the second defendant as the plaintiff`s estate agent. I have found that the second defendant was not the plaintiff`s estate agent and it is unnecessary to consider the allegations of negligence but I shall nevertheless deal briefly with the remaining three items of particulars of negligence alleged. I shall set out the particulars verbatim without making any attempt to correct any errors.
 25.
 (2) Negligence
 Bowstead & Reynolds On Agency 
 (16th Ed) has this statement at para 6-015: 
Every agent acting for reward is bound to exercise such skill, care and diligence in the performance of his undertaking as is usual or necessary in or for the ordinary or proper conduct of the profession or business in which he is employed, or is reasonably necessary for the proper performance of the duties undertaken by him.
 I think this is a convenient and useful starting point. One other matter needs to be mentioned. If the second defendant owed any duty as alleged it was as the plaintiff`s estate agent to find a buyer for the property. That was the case as pleaded. That was the nature of the engagement of the estate agent.
 26.
 `(a) failing to advise and explain to the plaintiffs properly and fully on the issue of the incidence of GST as estate agent` 
 
Mr Seow was an associate director of the second defendant and was very experienced in 
 en bloc 
 sales but no evidence was adduced as to the training which anyone was required to undergo or the skill he should have acquired to be an associate director of the second defendant or to carry on business as an estate agent. Where estate agents or in the case of a corporation its officers are not required to undergo any relevant training it is impossible to see how they or the corporation can owe to the client who has retained them or the corporation to find a buyer for the client`s property any duty to advise on or explain a matter of such complexity as `the issue of the incidence of GST`. There are further difficulties. GST was only introduced when the Act came into force on 1 April 1994 not four months before the option was given and whether it was chargeable depended on a number of factors including whether or not the taxable supply was made in the course or furtherance of any business carried on by the client as the taxable person. In my judgment an estate agent retained to find a buyer for a client`s property does not owe a duty to advise his client on the incidence of GST on the sale of the property.
 
 `(b) failing to insert the term that the first defendant was to bear the GST on the sale of the property in the option 
 
 27.
 (e) drawing up and submitting for the use of the plaintiffs an option to purchase without providing in the said option a clause to the effect that the purchaser would pay GST` 
 
Where an estate agent undertakes to prepare an option to purchase to be given by his client he owes a duty to exercise such skill and care as is reasonably necessary to prepare the option properly. Inserting a term as to payment of GST appears to me to be outside the scope of such duty. If the agent is not informed as to who should pay GST or that some provision should be made in this respect I cannot see that he owes any duty to write in a term to the effect that the buyer is to pay GST on the sale. He is not in breach of any duty to his client for drawing up and submitting for the use of his client an option to purchase without providing in it a clause to the effect that the buyer would pay GST. In my judgment the second defendant was not negligent as alleged or at all.
 
 Claim against the third to seventh defendants 
 
 28.
 (1) Solicitors
It is alleged in the statement of claim that `the conveyance was handled by the third to seventh defendants as solicitors for the plaintiff` and that they were instructed on 1 August 1994. Six items of particulars of negligence are alleged against them.
 29.Mr Loo said in his affidavit: 
Once the option was signed by myself, I did forward a copy to the firm of Messrs Seah Leong & Yap on the lst day of August 1994. Annexed hereto and marked `LLT-5` is a copy of the covering letter via which I sent the option to them.
 Under cross-examination Mr Loo said: 
Q: Loo (1). Paras 34, 36. You raised issue of GST to D5? 
A: Yes. 
Q: When? 
A: Between signing option on 27/7/94 and 1/8/94 I called her. I raised issue with her then. I called her on 28/7/94. I told her I signed option to sell the property and faxed her option. Copy of option I signed. 
Q: Told D5 you signed option and faxed option to her. All on 28/7/94? 
A: Yes. 
Q: That`s all you told her? 
A: No. Told her buyer would bear GST.
 30.Ms Ong said in her affidavit: 
In the morning of 1 August 1994, I received a phone call from Mr Loo Leong Thye (hereinafter referred to as `LT Loo`), the plaintiffs` managing director. LT Loo informed me that the plaintiffs have sold their building at No 62, Burn Road (hereinafter referred to as `the Burn Road property`). LT Loo informed me that the plaintiffs had granted an option to the intended purchaser for the purchase of the Burn Road property. At that material time, the identity of the intended purchaser was not disclosed to me. LT Loo then informed me that the plaintiffs wished to appoint Seah Yap Leong to handle the conveyance of the Burn Road property. I accepted LT Loo`s suggestion. In this respect, LT Loo said he will fax over to me a copy of the option to purchase (`the option`).
 There is an apparent conflict in the evidence. According to Ms Ong it was on 1 August 1994 that Mr Loo spoke to her and the option was to be faxed to her.
 31.Mr Loo went on to say under cross-examination: 
Q: Affidavit of Ong Ting Lan Lauren [Ong (1)] 19/12/97. Para 3. Received your call on 1/8/94? 
A: I remember calling her earlier. 
Q: Ong (1). Para 4. Faxed option to her on 1/8/94? 
A: Don`t agree. 
Q: LOTL-1. 2AB-1. Seen before? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Dated 1/8/94? 
A: Yes.
 LOTL-1, 2AB-1 and LLT-5 all refer to the same document. It was an agreed document. It was on the plaintiff`s note paper for fax and it said:

Helen Tay for Mr LT Loo
Re :
Attached please find a copy of the `option to purchase` form, duly signed and returned to you.
Thanks.
(Signed)
 `Returned` to you was clearly a mistake as the option did not originate from Ms Ong but taken as a whole it cannot be doubted that it appears to be the first occasion when a copy of the option was sent.
 32.Later Mr Loo said under cross-examination: 
Q: When option faxed? 
A: Option faxed on 28/7/94 ... 
Q: 2AB-1. Faxed on 1/8/94? 
A: No. It was sent. 
Q: How sent? 
A: By post. Or by hand. I am not too sure.
 The plaintiff`s note paper for fax (2AB-1) was said to have been sent by post or by hand but Mr Loo was not too sure which. If the option was faxed on 28 July 1994 there was no accompanying note or letter.
 33.The option received by Ms Ong did not have the name of her firm as the seller`s solicitors. This was written in after the option had been signed but before it was exercised. Mr Loo said under further cross-examination that a copy was faxed to Ms Ong after his conversation with her on the telephone. He said the copy faxed on 28 July 1994 `was very blur (
 sic 
) and not readable`. He said Ms Ong told him on 28 July 1994 or 29 July 1994 and he sent her a copy on Monday 1 August 1994 `because lawyers don`t normally work on weekends`.
 34.Mr Loo did not mention speaking to Ms Ong on 28 July 1994 or 29 July 1994 or sending the option earlier by fax or Ms Ong calling him about the quality of that fax in his affidavit. The note paper for fax was if he is to be believed not only sent by post or by hand but was sent along with a further copy of the option. On the evidence before me I find that Mr Loo spoke to Ms Ong on 1 August 1994 and not before and later that day he sent her a copy of the option by fax.
 35.Mr Loo said he agreed with what Ms Ong said in para 7 sentence 2 of her affidavit. This is what she said: 
However, I noted that when I spoke to LT Loo in the morning of 1 August 1994, apart from telling me the facts that I have set out in para 3 above, LT Loo did not voice his concern over these provisions nor did he ask me to review and/or give my comments on the terms and conditions in the option.
 I have set out in para 30 above what Ms Ong said in para 3 of her affidavit.
 36.When the plaintiff instructed its solicitors it had already granted an option to purchase the property for $11.5m. I find that the solicitors were instructed on 1 August 1994 and they were not instructed to review or to give their comments on the terms and conditions in the option. They were only instructed `to handle the conveyance`. I now consider the particulars of negligence alleged. Again I shall set out the particulars verbatim without making any attempt to correct any errors.
 
 (2) Negligence
 37.
 `(a) failing to advise the plaintiffs properly and fully as solicitors for the plaintiffs in the transaction` 
 
In answer to the request for further and better particulars in respect of the matters on which the solicitors allegedly failed to advise the plaintiff properly and fully and what advice they allegedly failed to give the plaintiff stated: 
(a) 
(i) failing to take all necessary steps to complete the transaction in accordance with the agreement; and 
(ii) failing to examine the option, failing to ascertain what the plaintiff is required under the option to be performed. 
(b) failing to advise the plaintiff accordingly of the aforesaid.
 The first thing to be said about the so called further and better particulars given is that they are not further or better particulars. Be that as it may other than in regard to GST which is considered in other items of particulars of negligence there appears to be no other allegation of any failure nor evidence to suggest any other failure.
 38.
 `(b) failing to draw the plaintiffs` attention to the fact that the agreement between the parties that the first defendant is to bear the GST was not included in the option` 
 
In the course of opening his case Mr Chung said that the agreement referred to was the agreement first partly in writing as contained in the option to purchase, secondly the oral term that the first defendant was to pay GST and thirdly the conduct of the first defendant in exercising the option. It was not disputed that the option which is the written part of the agreement alleged did not contain a term that the first defendant was to bear the GST.
 39.Mr Loo spoke to Ms Ong and later sent her a copy of the option. In his affidavit he did not say that he instructed her about any oral term whether as to GST or otherwise. It was only under cross-examination that he said he told Ms Ong that the buyer would bear GST. Ms Ong said that Mr Loo made no reference to payment of GST. Mr Loo denied that under cross-examination but he also agreed that when he spoke to Ms Ong he voiced no concern and did not ask her to review the option. If he was minded to instruct Ms Ong that the buyer was to pay GST he would have known that this was not stated in the option. He personally negotiated the terms of the option. He read it before he signed it. It would have been more likely that he would have voiced some concern and would have instructed Ms Ong to review the option. The more so as I have found that there was in fact no such term. He would have instructed Ms Ong to advise on the action he could take to include such term in the option. There is also the evidence I have already referred to as to the completion account. On the evidence before me I find that Ms Ong was instructed that the plaintiff had given an option to purchase the property and a copy of the option was given to her but she was not instructed that there was any oral term or that upon the exercise of the option any oral term would be part of the agreement or that as alleged there was an agreement between the plaintiff and the buyer or between any other parties that the first defendant was to bear the GST. In the circumstances she could not have known of the alleged agreement. She could not have drawn the plaintiff`s attention to such agreement not having been included in the option.
 40.
 `(c) failing to take into account for the GST at the time of completion` 
 
I have already referred to the evidence as to the completion account. There was no term in the agreement for sale of the property as to payment by the first defendant of GST on the sale. In the absence of such a term GST is the liability of the plaintiff if it is chargeable. There could have been no duty to take this into account.
 41.
 `(d) failing to advise the plaintiffs on GST implication until five months later when the plaintiffs were alerted by their accountants` 
 
The solicitors did not advise the plaintiff on its liability if at all for GST on the sale of the property. GST on the sale was not mentioned at all until July 1995 when Mr Loo called Ms Ong. No explanation as to the reference point for five months was given either in the evidence or from the bar but I will treat this as an allegation that the solicitors failed to advise until they were specifically instructed in this regard in about July 1995.
 42.The solicitors were instructed `to handle the conveyance`. It seems to me that the solicitors in these circumstances undertook a range of duties which may be considered in three stages viz the option stage, the contract stage and the completion stage.
 43.
 (i) Option stage
The solicitors were instructed after the option had been given. They received a copy of the option. They were not instructed that there were any terms not in the option. They were not instructed to amend the option. They would have had to peruse the option. They had to know if it was valid and for how long it remained valid. They had to know how the option was to be exercised. They had to know if there was anything to be done by the seller both before the option was exercised and after it was exercised. They had to peruse title in order to deal with the important question of deducing title and requisitions on title. They would owe a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in relation to these matters. They would owe a duty to advise the plaintiff and to refer to it for instructions as necessary or proper in relation to these matters.
 44.The option was silent on GST. That does not affect its validity or the exercise of the option or the title. That does not create any ambiguity in regard to any matter in relation to the sale of the property. I should not have thought that a solicitor would have been in breach of any duty to exercise reasonable skill and care if it did not occur to him that there was no express provision as to GST. However in the case before me Ms Ong said in her affidavit that on going through the terms and conditions in the option she noticed that there was no provision for GST or which party was to pay GST.
 45.Ms Ong also said that she noticed that the plaintiff had received $100,000 as option money and that upon exercise of the option 5% of the price would be paid to the plaintiff as deposit `upon verifying by the [plaintiff`s] solicitors that the balance 90% of the sale price is sufficient to meet up with the [plaintiff`s] bank loan` and another 5% on 15 September 1994 which would be before completion. She would have noticed that as provided in the option the $100,000 was treated as part of the first 5% and that there was no mention of GST on that part of the price having been paid or to be allowed for on completion. The `5% upon exercise and 5% later` provision was an unusual provision in that the deposit is usually 10% to be paid upon exercise of the option and so long as the property is mortgaged the deposit is paid to the seller`s solicitor to hold as stakeholder. Under this provision the plaintiff gained an advantage. Ms Ong said she `came to the conclusion that the plaintiff had decided to bear or `absorb` the GST`.
 46.Ms Hairani Saban, a legal practitioner of about 28 years` standing and author of 
 Singapore Conveyancing Practice: Forms Precedents and Materials 
, said that an oversight or omission to address the issue of GST in a commercial property transaction was not an insignificant omission as the consequences for such an omission directly touched on and affected the liability of the vendor under the GST Act. She referred to two cases which she said illustrated the problems arising from the parties` failure to act appropriately. 
Kuo Ching Yun & Anor v H & L Investments Holding Pte Ltd
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 47
  decided that GST was the liability of the supplier and 
Tropical Properties & Trading Pte Ltd v Suganung Tasani
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 677
  decided a question relating to a change in the tax charged on the supply under s 40 of the Act. The problems she has referred to are really the consequences. The supplier bears the burden of GST unless provision is otherwise made.
 47.If Ms Ong had not noticed that the option did not provide for GST there would have been no breach of any such duty as alleged. Although she did notice the omission there was nothing either in the option or in the instructions she had received to alert her to such matters as the likelihood that the option did not in that respect correctly express what the parties had agreed to or that the option was for that omission likely to be unworkable. In the circumstances of the case I think there was no duty on her part to advise the plaintiff on `GST implication` at the option stage.
 48.
 (ii) Contract stage
The solicitors would have to see that the option was properly exercised. This would include considerations as to the amount to be paid as deposit and whether what was paid was to be held by the solicitors as stakeholders or if the conditions were satisfied for payment of the deposit to the plaintiff. The solicitors would have to attend to requisitions on title. They would have to see that the next 5% was paid on due date. They would have to settle the form of transfer. Before the date fixed for completion they would have to prepare a completion account and a statement of what the plaintiff should receive in exchange for the transfer and what under the agreement the buyer was entitled to. No question of any duty to advise on `GST implication` can arise but I observe first that the plaintiff received a total of 10% of the price as deposit without any GST and without any mention of GST and secondly what has already been said about the completion account. There was no duty to advise on `GST implication` at the contract stage.
 49.
 (iii) Completion stage
The main duty undertaken by the solicitors at this stage was to attend completion by receiving the different sums of money in the completion account and delivering the transfer and such other documents as were necessary to pass title or as were agreed. The completion account was settled with the plaintiff. GST on the sale of the property was not mentioned. It was not provided for. There was no agreement for this to be paid by the buyer. There was no duty to advise the plaintiff on `GST implication` at this stage.
 50.In my judgment the third to the seventh defendants were not in breach of duty as alleged whether at the option stage or the contract stage or the completion stage or at any stage at all.
 51.
 `(e) failing to advise the plaintiffs on its rights and liabilities under the option` 
 
As the only loss alleged relates to GST the failure to advise alleged must relate only to GST or would result in such loss. I should think that this is well covered under item (d) above.
 52.
 `(f) failing to draw the plaintiffs` attention to the issue of the incidence of GST in a commercial property transaction and not advising it fully of the same` 
 
I should think that this too is well covered under item (d) above.
 53.In my judgment the third to the seventh defendants were not negligent as alleged or at all. Even if they were it has not been shown that the plaintiff has suffered the loss of $345,000 for GST. The option for sale was silent on GST. The agreement for sale was silent on GST. If GST was chargeable on the sale it was the liability of the plaintiff as the taxable person. The `loss` if that is the word that can correctly be used to describe the result is the consequence of the option and the option was settled by negotiation between the plaintiff and the buyer`s representative and to some extent the third party and signed by the plaintiff before the solicitors were instructed. It was not the consequence of any negligence or breach of duty on the part of the solicitors. It did not arise from any breach of contract or any duty under such contract as the plaintiff`s solicitors.
 54.
 Third party proceedings 
 
As I have dismissed the plaintiff`s claim against the second defendant the claim against the third party would also be dismissed.
 55.
 Costs 
 
I have dismissed the plaintiff`s claims against all the defendants and there are no reasons to depart from the usual order for costs. I have also dismissed the second defendant`s claim against the third party. In the circumstances of the case I thought it was reasonable for the second defendant to have commenced the third party proceedings for an indemnity or contribution. I accordingly ordered the plaintiff to pay the costs of all the defendants and also the costs of the third party.",1998-05-07 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This was an appeal by the public prosecutor against the acquittal of the respondent on two charges of knowingly giving false information under s 28(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed). After hearing arguments on both sides, I dismissed the appeal for the reasons I now give.
 2.
 The facts
The undisputed facts were as follows. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) had received a written complaint about one Paul Chua who was the President of the Singapore Body Builders Federation (SBBF). Pursuant to this, the respondent and one Jojo Sinclair, both bodybuilders, were called up to give information relating to the alleged commission of corruption offences by Paul Chua. On 12 April 1996, both of them went down to the CPIB and the respondent gave a statement to the senior special investigator of the CPIB. This statement (P4) later became the subject matter of the two charges. After the respondent went home, he realised that he had made a mistake in P4 and contacted Jojo Sinclair. Jojo Sinclair then informed the CPIB on 15 April 1996 that both she and the respondent had made mistakes in their statements. The respondent was called up nearly two weeks later and an interview on 30 April 1996 was arranged. When the respondent returned to the CPIB on 30 April 1996, he was interviewed from 10:30am to 12:20pm and for another hour in the afternoon before statement `C` was recorded at 3:05pm. On 14 January 1997, the respondent was charged with two counts of knowingly giving false information relating to the commission of corruption offences and a statement was recorded from the respondent under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). In answer to the charge of giving false information, the respondent stated `I have nothing to say`.
 3.Certain information in paras 9 and 10 of P4 was highlighted as false in the two charges: 
9 Sometime in June 1993, I won the Pro-M Classics held in Malacca which came with a monetary award of US$5,000. The money was forwarded to the SBBF by the organising committee. When I returned to Singapore, Paul Chua gave me cash of US$4,000 and I accepted it. 
 Paul Chua told me that he had deducted US$1,000 from the monetary awards as he had helped me to win by entertaining the judges in the competition. He did not tell me how he went about entertaining the judges to help me win the title 
. I did not ask him to return me the US$1,000 as I did not want to offend him 
10 About two months later after the Pro-M Classics in 1993, I was supposed to participate in the World Game Championship held at Holland. I was to take part in the middle weight category. The other two competitors who took part in this competition from Singapore was Jojo Sinclair (sic) and Mohd Ismail. Before we departed for Holland, I happened (sic) to see Paul Chua at the federation office together with Jojo Sinclair (sic) to discuss about the programmes and details of the coming World (sic) Game Championship. 
 In the middle of the conversation, Paul Chua asked me whether I wanted to win the World Game Competition. I told him of course I wanted to win and he then told me to give him $3,000. He said that he could help me win the competition by using the $3,000 to entertain the judges in the World Game Championship 
 and also to use part of it to throw a party (in Singapore) for the bodybuilders and their families and also the officials of the federation after the competition
 4.At the trial, the admissibility of statement `C` was objected to and a voir dire was held. At the end of the voir dire, the district judge found that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that statement `C` was made voluntarily. The statement was therefore excluded. The prosecution therefore relied on the evidence of Paul Chua that the allegations were false and that he could not have bribed the judges as they were all men of reputation and integrity. The prosecution also invited the court to draw an adverse inference from the respondent`s failure to mention his defence in his s 122(6) statement.
 5.At the close of the prosecution`s case, the respondent was called upon to enter his defence. The respondent`s defence was that the statements were made honestly; he believed the facts to be true when he made them. He only realised that there were some mistakes when he went home and recollected his thoughts. He readily admitted that, in relation to para 9, the Pro-M Classics 1993 was held on 30 August and not in June; the prize was US$4,500 and not US$5,000 and the prize money was given to him in Malacca and not forwarded by the organising committee to the SBBF. He maintained, however, that Paul Chua had obtained US$1,000 out of his prize money to defray the expenses in entertaining the judges.
 6.As regards para 10, the respondent asserted that Paul Chua did not ask him for $3,000 so that he could help him win the World Games Championship in Holland. The alleged purpose of the $3,000 was to throw a party for the bodybuilders, their families and the SBBF officials in Singapore after the World Games competition. The respondent explained that he acceded to Paul Chua`s requests for money because he was afraid that he might be placed under a ban again. He was also afraid that he might be `marked` and not be selected for overseas competitions.
 7.At the end of the trial, the district judge was not satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the respondent had given the information highlighted, knowing it to be false. The information might not be true and the respondent might even be careless or reckless about the information he had given but the district judge was of the view that this fell short of the requisite mental element: knowledge that the information he gave was false. In the circumstances, the respondent was acquitted of both charges.
 8.
 The appeal
The prosecution submitted that the district judge`s findings of fact and the inferences he drew, which formed the basis of the acquittals, were reached against the weight of the evidence. In addition, it was contended that the district judge erred in failing to draw an adverse inference from the respondent`s silence in his s 122(6) statement.
 9.First of all, it was submitted that the district judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the respondent`s history of defiance when he accepted the respondent`s evidence that he gave the money out of fear. It was undisputed that the respondent had earlier defied Paul Chua and the then Singapore Amateur Body Building Federation (SABBF) for the period of 1980 to 1988 and had, in 1994, expressed his dissatisfaction in the press with the Sportsman of the Year award and the Coca Cola/
 Sunday Times 
 Sports Star award. Even in 1993, when the two sums of money referred to in the charges were allegedly given, the respondent was often late for training sessions despite Paul Chua`s unhappiness about it.
 10.The prosecution also argued that there was no valid reason for the respondent to fear Paul Chua. There was no evidence to suggest that Paul Chua himself had the ability to impose a ban on the respondent. Neither was there evidence to show that a bodybuilder had been `marked` for being critical of Paul Chua. There was a selection committee on which distinguished members sat and a selection process. It was therefore unlikely that Paul Chua alone could make decisions as to the selection of bodybuilders for overseas competitions. The prosecution argued that the fear of being banned did not operate on the respondent`s mind as he could not even remember being placed on life-ban when he was initially questioned on it. For this reason, the prosecution contended that the respondent could not have been so fearful of Paul Chua that he would meekly comply with the requests for money in 1993 without any protests or attempts to seek clarification on the details of the payments.
 11.In my opinion, the district judge considered these facts fully in his assessment of the evidence. He found that the respondent`s defiance, as demonstrated in his taking part in contests and shows not sanctioned by the SABBF in the 1980s, occurred years before the money was alleged to be taken by Paul Chua. The respondent had paid the price for his defiant conduct, suffering an 18-month suspension and a life-ban. The respondent was therefore well aware of the influence of the SBBF and, whether mistakably so, of its President, Paul Chua. The respondent had rejoined the SABBF in 1988 and by 1993, he had aged five more years and was busily participating in competitions sanctioned by the new SBBF and the International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB) of which Paul Chua was the president and vice-president respectively. The district judge had also considered the respondent`s late attendance at training sessions and accepted the respondent`s explanation that it was due to legitimate reasons rather than an act of pure defiance.
 12.As for the respondent`s expression of dissatisfaction in the press, the district judge noted that the reports contained no adverse comments against Paul Chua and that it was the unrebutted evidence of the respondent that he had the support of Paul Chua in protesting about the injustice in the judging of the Coca Cola/
 Sunday Times 
 Sports Star award and about the prize money for the Sportsman of the Year award. In fact, the newspaper exhibit carried a photograph featuring both the respondent and Paul Chua. Paul Chua`s support for the respondent`s concerns was also evident from the tenor of the newspaper reports. The district judge therefore accepted the respondent`s explanation that he had complied with the requests for money because he was fearful that he might be banned again. I saw no ground for interfering with the district judge`s finding.
 13.Secondly, the prosecution alleged that the district judge erred in disregarding the fact that the respondent had a motive for fabricating allegations against Paul Chua. The respondent had readily admitted that he was angry with Paul Chua for not supporting his close friend Jojo Sinclair in the doping scandal which surfaced in November 1995 and because he had reneged on his promise to help the respondent find sponsors.
 14.Again, this was a matter of evidence. Dealing with the first source of unhappiness, the district judge found it unlikely that the respondent would collaborate with Jojo Sinclair in fabricating allegations against Paul Chua when he should be well aware that Paul Chua had endorsed Jojo`s nomination as the Sportswoman of the Year despite his knowledge that she was tested positive for barbiturate. The district judge found it difficult to believe that the respondent would make such a serious allegation to the CPIB in April 1996 when his unhappiness stemmed only from the fact that Paul Chua failed to withhold the positive results of her drug test. As for the second motive, the district judge found that, although the respondent had encountered financial difficulties in his professional bodybuilding career since 1994, it was highly improbable that the respondent would, after more than two years, suddenly decide to give false information about Paul Chua, merely because Paul Chua had gone back on his word to get him a sponsor.
 15.In coming to these conclusions, the district judge had been persuaded by the fact that the respondent was neither the complainant nor the informer who caused the CPIB to initiate investigations into alleged offences committed by Paul Chua. There was also the uncontradicted evidence of the respondent that he did not know that the CPIB was looking into the affairs of the SBBF and Paul Chua before going there on 12 April 1996. The district judge therefore had serious doubts that the respondent would, on the very day he went to the CPIB, decide to fabricate such serious allegations against Paul Chua simply because he considered that Paul Chua had not done enough to protect and clear Jojo Sinclair`s name or because Paul Chua had gone back on his promise to get him a sponsor.
 16.In my view, the district judge`s findings were sound. There was no evidence of such misgivings over the two incidents that would have motivated the respondent to fabricate allegations against Paul Chua, considering the circumstances under which P4 was made. While the absence of motive need not necessarily mean that no intention was present, the failure to attribute a motive to the respondent`s actions in the present case did nothing to bolster the prosecution`s case that an intention to make false allegations was existent.
 17.Thirdly, the prosecution contended that the district judge erred in accepting the respondent`s evidence as to Paul Chua`s alleged misconduct. It was inconceivable why the respondent did not query Paul Chua on the need to entertain judges to help him win when he felt that he had won the competition on his own merits. It was also difficult to understand why the respondent did not think about reporting Paul Chua to the authorities, considering his disgust about corruption in the sport of bodybuilding. The respondent had shown himself to be one who was not afraid to demonstrate his dissatisfaction or to speak out against the injustice done to him. Despite winning the second place in the Coca-Cola award and a prize money of $3,000, he returned the award and prize money because he felt that the judging process was unfair. He was not concerned about losing the $3,000 which would have been of assistance to him in his bodybuilding programme. It was therefore the prosecution`s submission that the respondent did not report Paul Chua`s alleged misconduct because there was in fact none.
 18.In my view, these arguments had already been dealt with by the district judge when he found that the respondent`s public demonstration of dissatisfaction enjoyed the support of Paul Chua. The respondent`s reticence to query Paul Chua as to the necessity of the payments or to report the alleged misconduct was consistent with his evidence that Paul Chua was in effect the authority. Whether this was so in actual fact was another matter altogether.
 19.The prosecution also contended that the district judge erred in finding the respondent a credible witness and in failing to adequately consider that his frequent lapses of memory pointed to evasiveness on his part. Although there were allegedly numerous occasions when Paul Chua requested money from him, the respondent was unable to remember, besides the occasion stated in para 9 of P4, other occasions when such a request had been made. In fact, he was unable to recall when was the first time Paul Chua made such a request; the number of times when such incidents happened; the various amounts of money which Paul Chua had obtained from him; and whether there were any occasions before, or after the 1993 Pro-M Classics when Paul Chua had made such a request. The prosecution contended that, if there were indeed such occasions, one would have expected the respondent to provide some account of these transactions. A reasonable inference to be drawn from this was that Paul Chua had never made such requests. The allegations in paras 9 and 10 in P4 were therefore false and made by the respondent knowing them to be so.
 20.The district judge had already taken the respondent`s fallibility of memory into account in ordering his acquittal: 
136 I could not accept the prosecution`s submission that the accused`s numerous claims to forgetfulness cast grave doubts on whether he was in fact telling [the truth] in paras 9 and 10 of exh P4, which related to events occurring in 1993. For a man like the accused, who was involved in numerous activities, overseas trips, media controversy, disciplinary matters as well as his constant training throughout the years, from the time he participated [in] competitive bodybuilding in 1980, it was reasonable to expect him in 1996 (in P4) and in 1997 (in court) to forget certain matters which had transpired in 1986 and 1993, while he could remember other matters. Furthermore, the fact that the accused was visibly slow in understanding questions asked of him and his slow response, should not also be interpreted as evasiveness on his part. He was forthright and frank in admitting that he was angry with PW5 about his passiveness in Jojo`s doping scandal and about PW5`s failure to keep his word to get sponsors for the accused.
 The district judge had also observed the respondent`s inability to understand questions and his taking time to answer them to be genuine and did not think that the respondent was being evasive.
 21.Essentially, the prosecution`s appeal was against the district judge`s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, in particular the respondent, and against the district judge`s failure to draw certain inferences from the evidence. Having perused the evidence, I was of the view that the district judge`s findings were neither against the weight of the evidence nor unsupportable. The inferences suggested by the prosecution were also far from irresistible. It is well-settled law that in any appeal against a finding of fact, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion of the trial judge who has had the opportunity to see and assess the credibility of the witnesses. An appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the trial judge`s decision, must not merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong: see 
PP v Poh Oh Sim
 
[1990] SLR 1047
 .
 22.Before me, the prosecution argued that since the district judge did not make a finding that Paul Chua`s evidence was unsatisfactory or inherently unbelievable, the allegations must be false, thus making out the charges against the respondent. I rejected this argument because the crux of the issue was not so much whether the statements were false but whether the respondent knew that they were false. In this regard, it was a defence to show that the statements were made as a result of a genuine mistake.
 23.There was no doubt that several details in para 9 of P4 were incorrect. In particular, the respondent`s prize money was US$4,500 instead of US$5,000 and this was not forwarded to the SBBF by the organising committee but given in cash to the respondent. The respondent however ventured an explanation for these mistakes. He made the mistake that his prize money was forwarded to the SBBF because he had received the money from the SBBF in 1991 when the competition was held in Singapore. As for details as to the date and the amount of the prize money, he had made mistakes because there were many competitions going on every year and it was difficult for him to remember when and how much money was involved. There was a dispute as to whether the respondent had received the prize money on the platform when he was announced the winner, as alleged by the prosecution, or whether he had only received the money at the farewell dinner after the competition, as alleged by the defence. This, in my view, was inconsequential and did not constitute the sting of the charge.
 24.The respondent maintained, however, that it was true that he gave $1,000 to Paul Chua because Paul Chua said that he had helped him to win by entertaining the judges. In fact, Paul Chua had taken part of his prize money many times by giving him only part of the prize money that he had won. The respondent raised two examples: when he won the Sportsman of the Year award and when he won the Meritorious award. As for para 10, the respondent asserted that the $3,000 was to host a party for the bodybuilders, their families and the SBBF officials after the World Games competition. Paul Chua did not ask him for $3,000 so that he could help him win the World Games Championship in Holland. He had made this statement because Paul Chua often talked about being the Vice-President of the IFBB, knowing all the judges and being able to take them around for a drink or to entertain them. Upon more careful thought on reaching home, he realised that he had made a mistake: that the $3,000 was not to entertain the judges but for the party that Paul Chua was going to organise. It was for this reason that he rang Jojo Sinclair and subsequently went to the CPIB to make corrections on 30 April 1996.
 25.As the essential element in the present case is knowledge on the respondent`s part, the test is subjective. Alternatively, the mistake has to be so incredible that the respondent must have known that the statement was false. In the present case, the respondent had raised a reasonable doubt that the statements might have been made as a result of a genuine mistake. Paul Chua held a high office in the bodybuilding circle and it was not implausible for him to talk about entertaining the judges and buying them drinks. Paul Chua himself had also testified that, in 1992 at least, the SBBF had retained part of the respondent`s monetary award for the Sportsman of the Year award. It may well be that the respondent made the mistake of putting two and two together in making the allegations in paras 9 and 10 of P4.
 26.As the district judge noted, it may be that the respondent was flippant, careless or even reckless in doing so but this did not mean that he had deliberately given false information. This was especially so taking into account the fact that the respondent was neither the informer nor the complainant who caused the commencement of investigations. He had been called up to give information and did so without the aid of any documents, relying only on his memory. In such a context, the mistakes which appeared in P4 and the inconsistencies between P4 and the respondent`s evidence were not sufficiently material to render the information, particularly those highlighted in bold in the two charges, false or incredible. The fact that the respondent had taken overt steps to correct the mistake he made in P4 so soon after the statement was made also supported his defence that he did not intend to make a statement knowing it to be false. I took the point that the allegations in paras 9 and 10 of P4 were very detailed in nature and stated in an assertive manner. While the respondent should be faulted for asserting as facts matters which he himself was not sure of, I found that his conduct fell short of the culpability required in the two charges.
 27.I then turned to the district judge`s failure to draw an adverse inference from the respondent`s silence in his s 122(6) statement. Having found that statement `C` was involuntarily given, the district judge did not consider it proper to draw an adverse inference from the respondent`s failure to mention his defence in his s 122(6) statement. During his examination-in-chief, the respondent testified that the same officer who recorded statement `C`, David Tan Siang Kiang, was the one who handed the charges to him and he was present when another officer, Goh Eak Kwan, read out the charges. This evidence was not challenged. Considering the respondent`s experience with David Tan on 30 April 1996 when the latter persistently refused to believe him when he said he had made mistakes in P4, it was reasonable for the respondent to think it useless to say anything and for him to expect the same treatment from other CPIB officers including Goh Eak Kwan whom he had not seen before. The district judge therefore accepted the respondent`s explanations for his silence: that he was afraid that he would be accused of lying as on 30 April 1996 and be charged a second time.
 28.The language of s 123(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) makes it clear that the court has a discretion whether an adverse inference is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. It is not the law that an adverse inference must be drawn whenever an accused elected not to say anything in his s 122(6) statement. In my view, the district judge had exercised his discretion judiciously in not drawing an adverse inference and there was no cause for any interference.
 29.In the circumstances, I was of the view that the district judge had not erred in law or in fact in finding that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. I dismissed the prosecution`s appeal accordingly.",1998-05-14 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This appeal arises out of the appellant`s conviction under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1997 Ed) (the Act) by the district judge Lau Wing Yum for driving recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which was dangerous to the public. The appellant was fined $3,000 and in default three weeks` imprisonment. He was also disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for 24 months. He paid his fine and is now under disqualification. The appeal was against conviction only. In addition, the appellant filed a criminal motion pursuant to this appeal to adduce fresh evidence before this court.
 2.The appeal came up for hearing before me on 31 March 1998. After hearing submissions from both the appellant`s counsel and the DPP, I dismissed the appeal. I now set out the grounds of my decision.
 3.
 The charge
The appellant faced the following amended charge: 
Summons No R97508144KD
 
You, Chung Tuck Kwai
 
M/39 yrs, NRIC No: S1232375/A
 
are charged that you on or about 30 January 1997 at about 2:39am along Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 junction of CTE, Singapore, did drive motor car SBR 2742 K in a manner which was dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road, to wit, by failing to conform to the traffic red light signal at the controlled junction of Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 by CTE, resulting in a collision with a motor car SBE 4651 U and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).
 4.
 The facts
The appellant was the general manager and director of Confield Manufacturing Pte Ltd and the owner of a Nissan car bearing the registration plate number SBR 2742 K. The car he was driving collided into another car driven by one Tay Hua Tian (Tay), an Alfa Romeo bearing the registration plate number SBE 4651 U in the early hours of 30 January 1997. It was this collision out of which the prosecution arose. It should be pointed out that Tay pleaded guilty to driving while under the influence of drink pursuant to s 67(1)(b) of the Act. He was fined $1,500 and disqualified from driving for 18 months.
 5.On 30 January 1997, at about 2:50am, the appellant was driving alone along the Central Expressway (CTE) slip road after a farewell party that night for one of the members of his staff. He had consumed a fair amount of alcohol at the party (eight glasses of brandy) but decided to drive afterwards as he felt that he was alert enough to control the car. At the same time, Tay was driving alone along the perpendicular road, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, after having some drinks with his friends at a temple. The two cars collided at the junction of the two roads. The appellant`s car slammed into the left of Tay`s car. On impact, the latter car swerved to the right and hit the traffic light pole on the right, bending it. Tay`s car was so badly damaged that it had to be scrapped.
 6.There was much dispute as to who was to be blamed for the collision. According to Tay, when he reached the junction, the traffic light was red. When it turned green, he proceeded forward at a slow speed when, all of a sudden, a car approached him from the left and collided into his car. He said that the appellant had driven on past the red light against him at a high speed. One Ng Piea Liong (Ng), who was driving directly behind Tay at the time of the accident, corroborated Tay`s version of events and reiterated that it was the appellant who drove on despite the traffic light having turned red. On the other hand, the appellant gave a different account. In his s 121 CPC statement made on 4 February 1997, he stated: 
Before reaching the controlled junction of Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 by CTE I saw the traffic light was green in my favour and the distance was about 3 to 4 car length (sic) away. On reaching the stop white line I saw the traffic light change to amber and I made a right turn into Ang Mo Kio Ave 3. As I was turning right a m/car SBE 4651U to my right, travelling along Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 in the direction of Ang Mo Kio Central, suddenly cut into path and as a result my vehicle`s front side collided against the other vehicle`s left front passenger door.
 At the trial, the appellant maintained his story that he was driving slowly at 40 kilometres per hour as he reached the junction.
 7.After the collision, Ng helped to extricate Tay out of his car. The latter was conscious and was not seriously hurt. He was injured on the left arm and ankle. The appellant was unhurt and he came out of his car towards Tay to enquire about the latter`s condition. According to Tay, the appellant told him that he could not apply the brake in time and that he was willing to compensate Tay. The appellant denied this under cross-examination. The appellant telephoned his subordinate, one Hou Fook Wai (Hou), and asked him to come to the scene immediately. There were at least three people with Tay - Ng and Tay`s two friends, Ah Leng and Seng Lee, who were in another car. The appellant, Tay and his friends tried to negotiate a private settlement (this was probably because both had been drinking - the appellant admitted this to Tay) but before they could reach a settlement, Corporal Foo Hee Kiang (Cpl Foo) and the investigating officer, Sergeant Sekaran Erulandy (Sgt Sekaran) arrived in the first police car. This was followed by two other police cars. An ambulance also arrived at the scene and administered first aid to Tay. Later Hou also arrived. Despite much resistance from the appellant and Tay, the police conducted breathalyser tests on both drivers who failed them. They were then brought to Toa Payoh Hospital for a blood test.
 8.One of the main issues in this appeal was whether Tay and Ng were acquainted at the time of the incident. This had an impact on the question as to whether Ng was an independent witness. Both Tay and Ng maintained that they were not acquainted with each other prior to the collision. According to them, Ng told Tay that should the latter require a witness, he could contact him at his pager number. At the trial, Ng gave his reasons for not volunteering to be a witness for the police: 
Q: You realised at the scene that the police wanted witnesses? 
A: Yes. 
Q: You did not want to be troubled? 
A: Yes. So I didn`t tell the police. 
Q: Why did you give your contact number to PW1 (Tay)? 
A: At the time, I told him that if he so required me to be a witness, then and only then would I be one. 
Q: Would you not be troubled then? 
A: It`s different from being present at the police station. If I were to tell them at that time, it would follow that I would definitely be required to give evidence as a witness.
 Ng stayed at the scene for about 50 minutes. The appellant gave conflicting accounts as to whether Tay and Ng knew each other. In his s 121 statement, he mentioned that Tay had 
 two 
 friends with him: 
At the same time during the conversation two friends of the other driver ie the driver of m/car SBE 4651 U joined him and accuse (sic) me of beating the traffic light to which I strongly rebutted.
 However, in his examination-in-chief, the appellant claimed that Tay had 
 three 
 friends with him, one of whom was Ng. He said that Ng, together with the other two friends, negotiated with him on the possibility of coming to a settlement. Hou backed up the appellant`s story in this aspect. He stated in his examination-in-chief: 
PW2 (Ng) was at the scene. He was one of the three friends. He was one of the other two when talking. I smelt alcohol. We, meaning PW1`s (Tay) three friends and I, tried to persuade the police to let us settle amongst themselves. The drivers were taking the breathalyser tests. PW2 mentioned PW1 as `my friend` when we were negotiating.
 9.On 4 February 1997, the appellant gave his s 121 statement before Sgt Sekaran, the investigating officer of the case. On 17 February 1997, Sgt Sekaran called up Tay for an interview. During the course of the interview, Tay informed him that he had an independent witness, Ng, and gave the officer the pager number. According to Sgt Sekaran, Tay told him that his friends were at the scene of the accident and asked if they could be his witnesses. Sgt Sekaran said that, since they were known to Tay, they were not independent eye-witnesses. Tay made a police report on the same day. The report, however, did not have Ng`s particulars. Sgt Sekaran called Ng, who came down on 21 February 1997 to record a statement.
 10.The appellant was subsequently charged under s 64(1) of the Act. The charge was amended on 29 September 1997.
 11.
 The district judge`s decision
In convicting the appellant, the district judge relied on a few factors in finding that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
 12.The judge found that the absence of Ng`s particulars in the police report did not weaken the prosecution`s case at all since Tay had already informed Sgt Sekaran about Ng during the interview. The judge was convinced that Tay and Ng were not acquainted with each other. Ng`s testimony was unscathed despite vigorous cross-examination. As there were other people at the scene, the judge was of the view that the fact that Ng was at the scene for some time (about 55 minutes) did not lend weight to the appellant`s claim that Ng knew Tay. He further reasoned at [para ] 54 of the grounds of decision: 
The defendant, to show that Ng was Tay`s friend, claimed that Tay and his friends approached Cpl Foo to let the drivers settle amongst themselves. However, it was not put to Cpl Foo that Ng had asked Cpl Foo to let the parties settle. Neither was it put to Ng at all that he had taken part in the negotiations. In fact, it was Cpl Foo`s clear evidence that a male Chinese, who said that he was known to Tay, told him he had seen the accident and that this male Chinese was not Ng. I thus found that the defendant`s claim was without merit.
 The judge found that the appellant`s testimony was inconsistent in the following aspects: -. the appellant`s evidence was that Ng, together with Tay`s two other friends, was involved in negotiating with him and the police. The appellant testified that he had informed Sgt Sekaran that Tay`s friends negotiated at the scene, yet he went on to say that he did not have any recollection of the exact roles played by the friends. He also testified that he had a recollection of Ng when he was at the traffic police, yet he claimed that his recollection was general when he instructed his counsel and would not have been able to instruct him about Ng`s role if he had not seen him in court;
 -. the appellant initially claimed that he had informed Sgt Sekaran about Tay`s three friends. Realising that his s 121 statement stated only two, he changed his evidence to say that he had told Sgt Sekaran about two of them. When it was pointed out to him that he did not mention Ng at all in his statement, he tried to explain it away by saying that he mentioned only the two friends who approached him.
 13.The judge similarly disbelieved Hou`s testimony. He found that Tay, Ng and Cpl Foo were truthful witnesses whereas the appellant was not a credible witness. He found that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had beaten the red traffic light at the junction and collided into the car driven by Tay.
 14.
 The appeal
The appellant was charged under s 64(1) of the Act, which provides: 
If any person drives a motor vehicle on a road recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.
 15.In coming to my decision, I looked at the following issues which were, in my view, pertinent to the outcome of the appeal: (i). Criminal Motion 8/98;
 (ii). whether Tay and Ng were acquainted with each other, making Ng not an independent witness;
 (iii). the effect of a non-independent witness;
 (iv). whether the appellant drove through the red traffic light and caused the collision.
 They were dealt with in turn.
 16.
 Criminal Motion 8/98
In this application, the appellant sought to adduce fresh evidence to show that, contrary to the judge`s findings and the testimonies otherwise, Tay and Ng were good friends and that both were involved with the running and management of the Ten San Tian Hock Temple. The appellant tendered the affidavit of a private investigator, Winston Lim, who conducted surveillance on Tay and Ng over several days and produced photographs and an investigation report to suggest that the two witnesses were acquainted with each other.
 17.The power of the High Court to take further evidence on an appeal is conferred by s 257(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the CPC). That section reads: 
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or Magistrate`s Court.
 It provides that additional evidence will be accepted only if it is 
 necessary 
. The principles with regard to the adduction of fresh evidence were laid down succinctly in 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  and followed in 
Van Damme Johannes v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 246
  and 
Carl Elias v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 501
 , adopting Lord Parker CJ`s pronouncement in 
R v Parks
 
[1961] 3 All ER 633
 and Lord Denning`s dicta in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 3 All ER 745
. Three conditions have to be fulfilled to justify the court taking additional evidence - non-availability, relevance and reliability. First, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given at the trial, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; and thirdly, the evidence must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible. In short, the circumstances in which an application to introduce fresh evidence will be allowed are extremely limited. The reason behind this is that a liberal policy will go against the grain of the adversarial system - the adversarial system in our trials is hardly compatible with allowing lacunae in the case of any party to be filled in by afterthoughts or reconstruction of any case after it has failed at the trial.
 18.Relying on the principles above, I dismissed the criminal motion as none of the three conditions were satisfied. First, such evidence of Tay and Ng`s alleged acquaintance could have been easily obtained at the trial if reasonable diligence was used to hire a private investigator. This was not done. The situation at hand was very akin to the Malaysian case of 
Che Din bin Ahmad v PP
 
 
[1976] 1 MLJ 289
 . In that case, the defence alleged that there had been collusion and a frame up between two prosecution witnesses. Fresh evidence of their friendly relations was sought to be introduced on appeal by way of a statutory declaration sworn by a third party who claimed to know the two witnesses and that he had seen them together on many occasions. The application was dismissed on the ground that this evidence could have been made available at the trial if the defence counsel had exercised due diligence. Secondly, even if the evidence was produced at the trial, it would not have had an influential effect on the case. The district judge based his findings not on the fact that Tay and Ng were strangers to each other but on the fact that the appellant`s testimony and evidence was inconsistent throughout whereas that of the prosecution witnesses was unshaken. The judge only remarked on the relationship of the two witnesses in passing, giving minimal weight to it. Besides, at the highest, all that the evidence showed was that Tay and Ng knew each other after the trial but did not show that they were acquainted on the day of the collision. Thirdly, the credibility of the evidence was open to dispute. At this stage of appeal, the prosecution would not have the opportunity of cross-examining Winston Lim to determine his credibility. The additional evidence was of such a nature that it ought not to be accepted as credible without Lim being put to cross-examination. For these reasons, this situation did not fall within the most exceptional circumstance that would lead the appellate court to consider it necessary to include the fresh evidence.
 19.
 Whether Tay and Ng were acquainted with each other, making Ng not an independent witness
I found that, on the evidence, Tay and Ng were not acquainted with each other at the time of the collision. Thus, Ng was an independent witness.
 20.First, in his s 121 statement, the appellant stated that only 
 two 
 of Tay`s friends were with him. However, at the trial, the appellant, for the very first time, mentioned that there were 
 three 
 friends with Tay at the scene, one of whom was Ng. When probed about the inconsistency while under cross-examination, his explanation was feeble and in vain. He claimed that he mentioned three friends to Sgt Sekaran when he was making his s 121 statement. Few lines down, he changed his story and said that he did not mention Ng: 
Q: When you gave your statement on 4 February 1997, the events were still fresh in your mind? 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You recollect telling the investigating officer about these three friends? 
A: I did. But no record of this in the statement. 
Q: Look at your statement. You only mentioned to the IO only two friends? 
A: At that time, yes. 
Q: You did not mention PW2 being PW1`s friend? 
A: At that time, no. 
Q: No mention of PW2 interceding with the ambulance? 
A: I didn`t inform the IO at that time. 
Q: You did not mention about PW2 at all? 
A: Yes, because I mentioned to the IO the first two persons who approached me. 
Q: Why can you now remember about PW2 than when you gave the statement to the IO? 
A: It`s only when PW2 testified in court then I recognise him and I started to remember. 
Q: Statement was made voluntarily? 
A: Yes.
 The appellant did not object to the voluntariness of the statement nor the contents therein. Yet, there was no cogent explanation for the inconsistency. Besides, he admitted that the events were fresh in his mind at the time he made the s 121 statement. It seemed incredible that he could not remember Ng`s presence if he remembered the presence of the other two friends. It was also unlikely that his memory would be suddenly jolted by Ng`s presence in court while his memory of the other two did not need to be `jolted`, especially in light of his claim that all three were allegedly together with Tay.
 21.Secondly, there was much inconsistency in the appellant`s testimony at the trial as to when Ng appeared at the scene and the role he played. From his examination-in-chief, it was clear that the appellant remembered Ng as having arrived immediately after the collision and well before the police and ambulance arrived: 
After the collision, as I was not injured, my first concern was for the other party. When I moved over to the side of PW1`s (Tay) vehicle, I noticed that his friend was pulling PW1 out of the vehicle. When I walked to PW1`s vehicle, I saw one of his friends attended to PW1. PW1 was sitting on the kerb. Another two of his friends approached me and insisted that I had jumped, that is beaten, the red light which I denied.
 
 
PW2 (Ng) was one of (sic) persons attending to PW1. Sometimes PW2 insisted that I had beaten the red light. He gave me the impression that he was known to PW1.
 
 
Subsequently, the police car arrived
 However, during further re-examination, he claimed that Ng arrived only after the ambulance arrived: 
Q: When did PW2 (Ng) first come into the picture? 
A: After the ambulance had arrived.
 The appellant was equally inconsistent when it came to describing Ng`s role. In his examination-in-chief, the appellant testified that Ng was among the three friends who negotiated with him prior to the arrival of the police: 
At first PW1 (Tay) was in a state of shock. Most of the discussion was between the three persons and I. One of them is PW2 (Ng).
 During cross-examination, he stated the contrary: 
Q: After the accident, PW2 merely pulled PW1 out of the car but did not take part in any settlement talk with you? 
A: Yes.
 Later in the cross-examination, he reverted to his first version: 
Q: Put that after the collision, PW2 (Ng) stopped his car and pulled PW1 (Tay) out of the car together with the others? 
A: Agree. 
Q: Put that PW2 remained at the scene but did not take part in the negotiations for settlement: 
A: Don`t agree. 
Q: Put that PW2 did not intercede with the ambulance attendant on PW1`s behalf? 
A: Don`t agree. 
Q: Put that all PW2 did was to inform PW1 that he was willing to be his witness and give him his particulars? 
A: Don`t agree.
 The appellant`s evidence in this respect was most unsatisfactory and should not be given any weight. Both Tay and Ng were not cross-examined on this point as the allegation that they were acquainted came to light only after the prosecution`s case was closed and after the appellant came onto the witness stand. There was no hint that they knew each other prior to the accident.
 22.
 The effect of a non-independent witness
I held above that Tay was an independent witness. A great issue was made out as to whether Tay was an independent witness. There were various testimonies to the effect that the police wanted only witnesses who were not acquainted to Tay as only they would be independent. This seemed to suggest (albeit wrongly) that friends could not be witnesses.
 23.In law, there is nothing which states that friends or people connected to the principal witness/accuser or the accused cannot be witnesses for the prosecution or defence. In order that a person can be called as a witness, he must satisfy two conditions: he must be competent and compellable. A competent witness is one who can be called on to give evidence. The general rule is that a witness is competent so long as he is intellectually competent. This is reflected in s 120 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed). An example of an incompetent witness is a very young child. A compellable witness is one who is competent to give evidence and who is bound to do so; failure is contempt of court. Generally, a competent witness is also compellable unless there is an exception, for example, in s 122(3) of the Evidence Act which states that an accused is not a compellable witness on his own behalf or on behalf of any person jointly charged with him. There is nothing in the Evidence Act or elsewhere which states that a friend or acquaintance is non-competent or non-compellable. The fact that the witness is an acquaintance only goes to the weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility. The weight to be given depends on the particular circumstances of the case. In fact, under s 135 of the Evidence Act, an accused can be convicted based on the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice. There is thus no reason why he cannot be convicted on the evidence of his accuser`s friend or acquaintance.
 24.As such, the effect of a non-independent witness goes to the weight of the evidence only and not to its admissibility.
 25.
 Whether the appellant drove through the red traffic light and caused the collision
I held that there was no reason to disturb the district judge`s findings on this point as he had come to his conclusion rationally on the available evidence.
 26.Tay and Ng were consistent throughout in maintaining their stand that it was the appellant who drove on despite the traffic light signal being red. Despite harsh cross-examination, their evidence remained unshaken. Both stated that Tay proceeded on only when the light turned green. It had been established that Tay and Ng were strangers to each other at the time of the collision. Ng was driving directly behind Tay when the accident occurred. He had no interest in the outcome of the prosecution. There was thus no reason for him to lie about the course of the events. Similarly, there was no incentive for Tay to put up a false account as he had already been convicted of the offence of driving while under the influence of drink under s 67(1)(b). Tay and Ng`s evidence corroborated each other. The appellant`s defence was one of bare denial. He said that the light turned amber as he was crossing the junction. In my opinion, the appellant`s version of the story could not be believed. He came across as a not too credible witness whose testimony was riddled with inconsistencies. His evidence should be discredited. Besides, he had no one to corroborate his story. The district judge was entitled to come to the conclusion he reached.
 27.For all the reasons above, I found that the appeal had no merit whatsoever. Thus, I dismissed the appeal against conviction accordingly.",1998-05-15 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant faced 68 charges of cheating, attempted cheating and abetment of cheating of various shops by the use of counterfeit credit cards. The prosecution proceeded with ten of the charges and the other 58 were stood down. Of the ten charges, two were for cheating and eight for abetment by conspiracy of cheating. The two cheating charges (exhs P1 and P2A) concerned a car accessories shop, Hui Auto Trading. P1 stated: 
You,
 
Ong Tiong Poh, M/20 yrs
 
NRIC No: 7620409-H
 
are charged that you, on 8 January 1997, at about 6.21pm at M/s Hui Auto Trading located at Blk 3015 Ubi Road 1, Singapore, did cheat one Tan Mong Hong, a manager of the said establishment, to wit, you presented a counterfeit Hongkong Bank Visa credit card No 4630-9700-0025-7802 in the name of Tan Kok Keong to the said Tan Mong Hong for payment of an exhaust pipe amounting to $250 to deceive him into believing that you were the rightful holder of the said credit card when you knew you were not and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Tan Mong Hong to accept the said counterfeit credit card for payment of the said exhaust pipe which he would not have done had he not been so deceived and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 P2A was in similar terms except that the time of payment was slightly different and the goods bought were `car accessories` worth $300.
 2.Four charges (P3, P4, P5 and P8A) concerned a fashion boutique, Mode Boutique. P3 stated: 
You are charged that you, in the month of December 1996 in Singapore, did engage with one Chan Chee Ong, Koh Kok Keong, Ng Wee Teck, Poh Kian Hua, Koh Teck Kwang and others unknown in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely to cheat, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on 22 December 1996 at or about 5.54pm at M/s Mode Boutique located at #02-29, Parkway Parade Shopping Centre, Singapore, to wit, one Chan Chee Onn presented a counterfeit Hongkong Bank Visa credit card No 4252-1700-0980-4194 to one Nancy Ong, a cashier of the said establishment for payment of a Prada Brand handbag amounting to $1,017.70 to deceive the said Nancy Ong into believing that he was the rightful holder of the said credit card when you knew he was not and by such manner of deception, Chan Chee Onn dishonestly induced the said Nancy Ong to accept the said counterfeit credit card for payment of the said items which she would not have done had she not been so deceived, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 P4 related to a wallet and belt amounting to $500, and P5 another wallet and belt amounting to $875. P8A involved a different counterfeit card, which was used to pay for a handbag amounting to $1,150; the person using the card was alleged to be Koh Kok Keong.
 3.One charge, P6B, related to a goldsmith shop, Only Gold: 
You are charged that you, in the month of December 1996 in Singapore, did engage with one Chan Chee Onn in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely to cheat, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on 24 December 1996 at or about 5.33pm at M/s Only Gold located at No 200, Victoria Street, #01-23, Singapore, to wit, one Chan Chee Onn presented a counterfeit Mastercard credit card No 5442-9630-0010-7007 to one Evelyn Lim, a cashier of the said establishment for payment of gold jewelleries amounting to $2,750.13 to deceive the said Evelyn Lim into believing that he was the rightful holder of the said credit cards when you knew he was not and by such manner of deception, Chan Chee Onn dishonestly induced the said Evelyn Lim to accept the said counterfeit credit card for payment of the said items which she would not have done had she not been so deceived, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 4.The remaining three charges - P7, P9 and P10A - were also similar in form to P3. All alleged that the appellant had conspired with the same four persons and others unknown to cheat, and that cashiers had been dishonestly induced to accept the cards for payment, which they would not have done had they not been deceived. One charge, P7, differed in that the cashier was also alleged to have been dishonestly induced to `deliver` the items purchased, which he would not have done had he not been deceived. P7 and P10A both concerned a goldsmith shop, Nilgiris Gold Jewellers; according to P7, Koh Kok Keong had presented a counterfeit card on 22 December 1996 at about 4.34pm to pay for jewelry amounting to $1,035, while in P10A Ng Wee Teck had presented another counterfeit card that same day at about 4.42pm to pay for a necklace valued at $2,479. The last charge, P9, alleged that Ng Wee Teck had presented a counterfeit card on 14 December 1996 at about 2.22pm to pay for bird`s nest amounting to $3,078 at Healthy Ginseng Birdnest Pte Ltd.
 5.At the trial, Chan Chee Onn (CCO), Koh Kok Keong (KKK), Ng Wee Teck (NWT) and Poh Kian Hua (PKH) testified for the prosecution. They, along with Koh Teck Kwang (KTK), were each serving jail sentences ranging from two to three years in duration after having pleaded guilty to multiple charges under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The gist of their evidence was that the appellant helped to run a counterfeit credit card syndicate. CCO, KKK, NWT, PKH and KTK were `runners` who would use the counterfeit cards to buy goods in shops. The purchased goods would be handed to the appellant, PKH or other persons and the `runner` would later receive 30% to 40% of the value of the goods as commission from them.
 6.I will briefly summarise the evidence of each witness. CCO testified that the appellant had previously been `caught` in Japan for making counterfeit credit cards. Upon his return to Singapore, the appellant asked him to be a runner for counterfeit credit cards, and sent him to Malaysia for `training` for a week with NWT, to learn how to use the counterfeit cards. Later the appellant contacted him for work in Singapore and he made a number of purchases using counterfeit cards on the appellant`s instructions; after purchase of the goods he would hand them to the appellant and get the commission of 30% to 40% of the selling price of the goods. As for the transactions mentioned in the charges, at a meeting at Lion City Hotel on 14 December 1996, the appellant had given instructions to the group for purchases at Healthy Ginseng Birdnest Pte Ltd, and consequently they bought bird`s nest from the shop using a counterfeit card. The appellant also gave instructions for the purchases at Nilgiris Gold Jewellers on 22 December 1996. After buying goods from Nilgiris the group proceeded to Parkway Parade shopping centre, where they met with the appellant at a KFC restaurant. There the appellant gave them more credit cards and instructed CCO to buy goods from Mode Boutique. CCO did so, passed the goods to the appellant, and received 30% of their value from him two days later as commission. On 24 December 1996, he was instructed by the appellant (again at Lion City Hotel) to go to Only Gold alone to buy gold; later he again received 30% of the price as commission. CCO added that the mastermind of the credit card scheme was one Lee Chee Mun, whom he was introduced to by the appellant in Malaysia. PKH would transport the counterfeit cards from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore and hand them to the appellant. The group would meet at the lobby of Lion City Hotel to discuss what to purchase; the appellant could usually be found at an adjacent building, City Plaza, and it was convenient for them to meet him at Lion City Hotel.
 7.KKK was the appellant`s childhood friend. He testified as a prosecution witness but was cross-examined by the prosecution as he sometimes refused to implicate the appellant. He said that the appellant had asked him before to purchase goods with counterfeit cards but he had refused; he worked instead for PKH and his cards and instructions came from PKH. But he also said that the appellant had agreed, together with the others, to use counterfeit cards to buy goods. He denied having said that the appellant was the `mastermind` of the scheme in his statement to the police and mitigation plea in court, but gave no satisfactory explanation for these previous statements.
 8.NWT testified that the appellant had recommended him to work as a purchaser using counterfeit credit cards. The appellant had sent him and CCO to Kuala Lumpur for training, after they met up with someone called Ah Lee in Johore. Shortly after his return to Singapore, the appellant told him the credit cards had arrived and they could start work soon. Before going to Healthy Ginseng on 14 December 1996, the appellant had met with himself, CCO, KTK and KKK at Lion City Hotel; but he received instructions for the purchase and the card from PKH. Before buying goods from Nilgiris on 22 December 1996, he met with the appellant, KKK, CCO, PKH and KTK, at Lion City Hotel; instructions were again given by PKH. After the purchases at Nilgiris, they met the appellant at the KFC restaurant in Parkway Parade. The appellant decided to make purchases at Mode Boutique. They then proceeded to buy goods at Mode Boutique while the appellant waited outside the shop. NWT testified that he usually received cards and instructions from PKH, but the appellant would sometimes give instructions and had previously taken delivery of goods purchased with counterfeit cards.
 9.PKH testified that he delivered counterfeit cards to the appellant and the appellant would distribute the cards to the others. The appellant, and another person named Jason, gave instructions on the purchases to be made. PKH recalled the purchases made at Healthy Ginseng, Nilgiris and Mode Boutique and said that the appellant was involved in these purchases. In particular he had given instructions to make the purchases at Nilgiris and Mode Boutique. PKH added that in general either Jason or the appellant would take possession of the purchased goods, and most members of the group received their commission from Jason or the appellant.
 10.For the two charges of cheating concerning Hui Auto Trading, the proprietor of the workshop testified that a person had come with KKK, who was the owner of the car, and had used a credit card to make two payments, of $250 and $300; but he was not able to identify the appellant as the person who paid. KKK testified that the appellant had volunteered to pay for him, but KKK did not see how payment was made as he had been outside the workshop waiting in his car.
 11.The appellant testified in his own defence. For the two cheating charges, he said that he had waited for KKK outside Hui Auto Trading and did not know what happened inside; he had never entered the workshop and did not possess any credit card at the time. For the other eight charges for abetment, he testified that CCO and KKK were his friends and he had introduced them to one Ah Lee because they kept asking him for ways to make `fast money`. He admitted knowing that Ah Lee was dealing in counterfeit credit cards. He also admitted knowing the other alleged conspirators through KKK and CCO and having been present at their meetings when they discussed what to buy with their counterfeit cards. However, he asserted that he had never been a party to their conspiracy and had no personal involvement in the credit card scheme, because he knew it was an offence; he met them only as a friend and because they often met at Lion City Hotel which happened to be near his workplace in City Plaza. He did not know who was the leader of the group but said that PKH often gave instructions. He said the other witnesses were lying when they implicated him in their conspiracy. When asked why they would do so, he said he had previously quarrelled with CCO, and had also lectured PKH and NWT for asking KKK to join them and since then they had seldom talked to him.
 12.KTK was a defence witness. He said he had only recently joined the group. He did not mix with them much. On the few occasions when he made purchases, he had been given the credit cards by PKH, and received payment from PKH or CCO. He had seen the appellant with the group but gave little information on the nature of the appellant`s involvement.
 13.
 The decision below
The district judge convicted the appellant on all ten charges. For the two cheating charges, he was satisfied that the accused had presented the counterfeit card at Hui Auto Trading. For the eight abetment charges, he found that PKH had delivered counterfeit cards to the appellant on several occasions; the appellant had handed cards to other members of the group, given instructions to purchase goods at specific shops, received the purchased goods and paid out commissions based on the selling price of the goods. The appellant was present at the meetings the group held before they made the purchases, and the group agreed to the appellant`s instructions or suggestions as to where and what to buy. The evidence that the appellant had sent CCO and NWT to Malaysia for training in the use of the counterfeit cards had not been contradicted. The judge thus held that the appellant had engaged in December 1996 in a conspiracy to cheat the various shops using counterfeit credit cards and CCO, KKK and NWT had consequently carried out the illegal acts of cheating the four merchants named in the eight charges. Hence the charges had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
 14.For sentencing, the judge said he detected no remorse in the appellant but noted that he was still young (aged 21). Since no record was produced by the prosecution of his previous conviction in Japan, he was treated as a first offender. For the two cheating charges, there was no indication that the appellant had personally benefitted from the offences and the amounts involved totalled only $550; the judge thus sentenced him to eight months` imprisonment for each charge. For the other eight charges, after considering the sentences received by his accomplices and his age, the judge sentenced him to 14 months` imprisonment for each charge. Three of these sentences were ordered to run consecutively and concurrently with the other seven sentences, making a total of 42 months` imprisonment.
 15.
 The appeal
The appellant did not dispute the judge`s findings of fact. Instead, the appellant contended that all the charges except for P7 were flawed, because they alleged that the victims were induced into accepting the counterfeit cards, an act which each victim would not have done had he not been deceived. This was not what was required for an offence of aggravated cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code. It was therefore argued that the convictions for all charges except P7 should be set aside.
 16.For convenience, I first reproduce the relevant sections of the Penal Code: 
415 Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to `cheat`. 
 
417 Whoever cheats shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both. 
420 Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
 17.I agreed with the appellant`s submission that the nine charges other than P7 did not correctly set out the elements of the offence under s 420. As far as the present case was concerned, the requirements under s 420 should have been (i) cheating, and (ii) thereby dishonestly inducing the person deceived to deliver any property to any person.
 18.To show that `cheating` took place for s 420, in principle any of the variants of cheating as defined in s 415 may be relied upon by the prosecution. Section 415`s requirements are that an accused, by deceiving a person, 
(i) fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived
 
(a) to deliver any property to any person, or 
(b) to consent that any person shall retain any property, or
 
(ii) intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he was not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property.
 19.But if the prosecution asserts that s 420 applies because an accused dishonestly induced the person deceived to deliver property, there should in practice be no reason to rely on limb (ii) above of s 415 to establish that he `cheated` under s 420. If the prosecution nonetheless chooses to do so - as appeared to be the case here - the charge should still allege that the accused dishonestly induced the person deceived to deliver property, as this is an important requirement of s 420. The charges here failed to do so. I therefore regarded the charges as defective.
 20.However, s 162 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) provides that no error or omission in stating the offence or particulars in the charge shall be regarded as material unless the accused was misled. In addition, s 396 provides, inter alia, that no finding, sentence or order shall be reversed or altered on account of any error, omission or irregularity in the charge unless it occasioned a failure of justice. The High Court may, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, amend a charge: 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
 .
 21.Counsel for the appellant submitted that the charges here should not be amended to properly reflect the requirements of s 420 because it was not clear that the prosecution had intended to proceed under s 420 in the first place. He argued that the `gravamen` of the charges was that the victims had been induced into accepting the counterfeit credit cards for payment, which they would not have done had they not been deceived; there was no mention about any delivery of property in these charges and therefore the appropriate offence disclosed by the charges was merely simple cheating, as defined in s 415 and punishable under s 417. Counsel further submitted that the charges` mention of `dishonestly` as the mens rea - instead of the `intentionally` required for the relevant limb of s 415 - was merely a mistake by the officer who had framed the charge. Lastly, it was pointed out that the delivery of property was not specifically mentioned in the evidence of the various persons who had been deceived by the counterfeit cards.
 22.I was unable to accept these arguments. The prosecution was obviously proceeding under s 420 and the higher maximum sentence it entailed, and it was unrealistic to suggest that the prosecution actually had ss 415 and 417 in mind. In my view, the officer framing the charges had made a mistake in omitting to state that the victims were induced to deliver property, and in consequence the evidence of the shops` representatives - oral testimony from the proprietor of Hui Auto Trading, and conditioned statements in the case of the other shops - did not specifically mention that property had been delivered.
 23.I was of the view that the defects in the charges were immaterial. The appellant conducted his defence below on the basis that he was not a party to any conspiracy to use counterfeit credit cards and, for the two cheating charges, that he had never entered the car workshop and did not possess any credit card then. These assertions were rejected by the district judge and his findings were not disputed on appeal. There was ample evidence that the appellant was helping to run a counterfeit credit card syndicate and had been involved in the transactions set out in the charges. It was clear, from the credit card charge slips exhibited and the rest of the evidence, that the various persons deceived were in fact induced to deliver `property` - the goods successfully purchased or, for the two cheating charges, the automobile accessories installed.
 24.These inducements were `dishonest`, within the meaning of s 24 of the Penal Code, because there was in each case an intention on the part of the person using the card to cause wrongful gain to himself and his accomplices, or alternatively to cause wrongful loss to the shops or the party ultimately bearing the expense of credit card fraud. The particular way the charges here were framed could not have affected the substance of the evidence below or how the appellant`s defence was conducted.
 25.Accordingly, I amended the charges to correctly reflect the requirements of s 420 and convicted the appellant thereon, and dismissed the appeal. The charge in exh P1 was amended as follows: the words `which he would not have done had he not been so deceived` were deleted and replaced by the words `and to deliver the exhaust pipe to Tan Kok Keong`, such that the amended charge read: 
You are charged that you, on 8 January 1997, at about 6.21pm at M/s Hui Auto Trading located at Blk 3015 Ubi Road 1, Singapore, did cheat one Tan Mong Hong, a manager of the said establishment, to wit, you presented a counterfeit Hongkong Bank Visa credit card No 4630-9700-0025-7802 in the name of Tan Kok Keong to the said Tan Mong Hong for payment of an exhaust pipe amounting to $250 to deceive him into believing that you were the rightful holder of the said credit card when you knew you were not and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Tan Mong Hong to accept the said counterfeit credit card for payment of the said exhaust pipe and to deliver the exhaust pipe to Tan Kok Keong, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 26.The second cheating charge (P2A) was similarly amended. For the abetment charges, the charge in exhibit P3 was amended to read: 
You are charged that you, in the month of December 1996 in Singapore, did engage with one Chan Chee Ong, Koh Kok Keong, Ng Wee Teck, Poh Kian Hua, Koh Teck Kwang and others unknown in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely to cheat, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on 22 December 1996 at or about 5.54pm at M/s Mode Boutique located at #02-29, Parkway Parade Shopping Centre, Singapore, to wit, one Chan Chee Onn presented a counterfeit Hongkong Bank Visa credit card No 4252-1700-0980-4194 to one Nancy Ong, a cashier of the said establishment for payment of a Prada Brand handbag amounting to $1,017.70 to deceive the said Nancy Ong into believing that he was the rightful holder of the said credit card when you knew he was not and by such manner of deception, Chan Chee Onn dishonestly induced the said Nancy Ong to accept the said counterfeit credit card for payment of the said items and to deliver the items to Chan Chee Onn, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 27.The other abetment charges (with the exception of P7) were amended along similar lines, with the person presenting the credit card being described in the charge as the person to whom the items were delivered.
 28.
 Sentence
The maximum term of imprisonment under s 420 is seven years; the same punishment is prescribed for the charges for abetment by conspiracy under s 109. It may be noted that the other 58 charges which were stood down at the start of the appellant`s trial below were not taken into consideration for sentencing; the prosecution asked for mention dates for these charges at the end of the trial. As stated above, the district judge sentenced the appellant to eight months` imprisonment for each of the two cheating charges and fourteen months for each of the abetment charges. The sentences for three of the abetment charges were ordered to run consecutively and concurrently with the other seven sentences, for a total of 42 months` imprisonment.
 29.The judge gave two main reasons for the appellant`s light sentence: his age of 21, and the similar sentences of between two to three years` imprisonment imposed on his accomplices. I did not think the second reason was valid. His accomplices pleaded guilty. Moreover, the appellant played a more important role in the credit card operation than the accomplices; as already stated, the judge found that he recruited some accomplices and sent them for training, distributed the counterfeit cards, gave instructions on purchases, took delivery of the goods and paid commissions.
 30.In my view, the sentences imposed by the district judge did not properly reflect the seriousness of the appellant`s offences and were manifestly inadequate. The appellant appeared to be part of a sophisticated syndicate, capable of committing credit card fraud on a large scale and skilled at avoiding detection; this had to be taken into account in sentencing. I therefore enhanced the appellant`s sentences for the two cheating charges to 12 months` imprisonment for each charge. For the eight abetment charges, I enhanced the sentences to 20 months` imprisonment for each charge; three of these sentences were to run consecutively while the remaining sentences were to run concurrently, making a total of 60 months` imprisonment. If not for the appellant`s young age, the sentences would have been more severe.",1998-06-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

GP SELVAM J
 
 The original claim (14 December 1993) 
 1.There are two plaintiffs in this case. The first plaintiffs, Remus Innovation Forschungs-Und Abgasanlagen-Produktionsgesellschaft mbH, an Austrian company are the manufacturers of `Remus` brand rear silencers (exhaust systems) for motor cars since 1990. Their product has been marketed in over 30 countries and their brand is well known among car buffs. The second plaintiffs, Retroseal Services Pte Ltd, a Singapore company, since July 1992 have been the sole authorised importers and distributors of `Remus` brand silencers for Singapore, Malaysia and Sumatra. A company called Fong Kim Exhaust System (`Fong Kim`) and their associates Hui Auto have been their authorised dealers.
 2.There are three defendants. The first two are individuals: Mr Hong Boon Siong and Mr Hong Chee Chiang. They are partners of a business called `Jeep Chee And Company` and for that reason should be treated as a single defendant. I shall therefore call them `the first defendants` meaning the firm. There is another defendant - Jeep Chee Trading Pte Ltd whom I shall call `the second defendants` meaning the limited company. The defendants have been in the business of importing, exporting and retailing motor car exhaust systems. As such they are key competitors of the second plaintiffs. They vend several brands of silencers.
 3.The second plaintiffs claim that they extensively advertised, promoted and sold `REMUS` brand silencers in Singapore after their appointment. In particularly, they claim, they advertised and promised their unique `2 year unlimited mileage` warranty: one which had not been seen in the Singapore market. It comprised, the second plaintiffs contained, `(i) 2 years, (ii) unlimited mileage, (iii) non corrosion of the exhaust system (iv) joints not giving way, (v) increase of 3 to 5% in power without increase in fuel bill and (vi) possibility of even a resulting reduction in fuel consumption.` Accordingly, the second plaintiffs further claimed, they had a reputation and goodwill in the `REMUS` exhaust system in Singapore.
 4.The second plaintiffs became aware that on 6 November 1993, the first defendants had sold an exhaust system bearing the `REMUS` mark to one Dr Yeong Kuan Yuen and gave him a two-year warranty for the system (Dr Yeong`s silencer`).
 5.On 16 November 1993 and again on 18 November 1993 the plaintiffs` solicitors wrote to the first defendants, the partnership firm, letters in the following terms: 
Infringement of exclusive distribution rights
 
We act for remus Innovation Forschungs-und Abgasanlagen-Produktionsgesellschaft mbH and Retroseal Services Pte Ltd, the manufacturers and the sole and exclusive importers and distributors respectively of `Remus Exhaust Systems` (hereinafter called `the product`).
 
It has recently been brought to our clients` attention that you have been or are intending to import, offer for sale, expose for sale, sold and/or otherwise dealt in the product, without our clients` prior authorisation.
 
We would advise that each of your acts constitute an infringement of our clients` proprietory rights in the product. For each of these wrongful acts, our clients are entitled to commence legal proceedings against you in court, claiming an injunction to prohibit you from continuing to import, offer or expose for sale, sell and deal in the product as well as damages and costs.

 6.Not having received a response to their peremptory demands contained in the letter, the plaintiffs on 14 December 1993 issued a writ against the first defendants. The substance of the allegations in the statement of claim was that the first defendants imported into Singapore and sold `REMUS` products when the second plaintiffs had the exclusive right of distribution of `REMUS` brand products in Singapore. In support of their claim the plaintiffs made two assertions of fact: (a). that the first defendants on 6 November 1993 retailed one `REMUS` exhaust system at S$440; and
 (b). that the first defendants gave a two year warranty on the `REMUS` product they sold.
 7.The first defendants, it was alleged, had infringed the exclusive right of the second plaintiffs by selling and/or distributing the `REMUS` products without authorisation. The plaintiffs argued that the first defendants` acts were calculated to deceive and mislead members of the trade and public to believe that the first defendants were the duly authorised dealers of the plaintiffs. Further the acts amounted to a representation by the defendants that the two year warranty given in respect of the products purchased from the first defendants would be honoured by the first or the second plaintiffs. Based on the above two causes of action were raised: breach of exclusive right of distribution and passing off.
 8.
 First amendment (29 March 1994) 
 
On 21 March 1994 the plaintiffs obtained leave to amend the writ and statement of claim to add a claim based on alleged breach of copyright in respect of the first plaintiffs` catalogue and filed an amended statement of claim on 29 March 1994.
 9.The amendment added the allegation that the first defendants` breach was flagrant and extended the claim to include `aggravated and/or additional damages`. The specific matters of which complaint was made, asserted the amended statement of claim, showed by way of inference that the first defendants and/or those acting on their behalf were conducting a substantial, deliberate, clandestine and indiscriminate campaign of copyright infringement. Several paragraphs were added to substantiate the extravagant claims based on infringement of copyright and passing off. The principal purpose of the amendment was of course to include the claim for infringement of copyright as an adjunct to the passing off claim.
 10.
 Application for interim injunction 
 
On 28 March 1994 an application was filed to move the court for an injunction to restrain the first defendants from selling fake `REMUS` exhaust systems, pretend to be authorised agents of `REMUS` exhaust systems and selling imitation `REMUS` exhaust systems. This was Notice of motion no 64 of 1994.
 11.
 Second amendment (24 June 1994) 
 
In June 1994, before the application for interim injunction was heard, the writ and statement of claim were amended after obtaining leave of court. By this act Jeep Chee Trading Pte Ltd the second defendants were added as defendants. Otherwise the claims and allegations in essence remained the same.
 12.In August 1994 the application for interim injunction (notice of motion no 64 of 1994) was amended with leave of court to confine it to first defendant only. On 13 August 1994 the plaintiffs filed another notice of motion (no 158 of 1994) seeking an interlocutory injunction against the second defendants to restrain them from selling counterfeit `REMUS` exhaust systems.
 13.By September all defendants had filed their defences. The pleadings closed in October 1994 the latest. Both motions for interlocutory injunctions were heard by Warren LH Khoo J in November and December 1994 and dismissed on 6 December 1994.
 14.The plaintiffs appealed against the decision of Warren LH Khoo J. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part and made the following orders : 
The first and second respondents (that is the first and second defendants who were trading as Jeep Chee and Company) whether acting by themselves, their officers, employees, servants or agents or any of them or otherwise howsoever be restrained from doing or directing, procuring, instigating, causing, enabling or assisting others from passing off or attempting to pass off themselves as an authorised distributor and/or dealer of the appellants or either of them and/or of exhaust systems for motor vehicles bearing the REMUS mark (`the Products`) and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, by:
 
(i) misrepresenting that the first and second respondents are authorised distributors or dealers of the appellants or either of them and/or of the Products; 
(ii) promoting, distributing, offering for sale or selling any exhaust system under or by reference to the REMUS mark or any colourable imitation thereof without making clear to each and every customer before he or she buys such system that the first and second respondents are not authorised distributors or dealers of the appellants or either of them and/or of the Products;
 
until the trial of this action or until further Order.
 
The third respondent (that is the third defendant, Jeep Chee Trading Pte Ltd) whether acting by itself, its officers, employees, servants or agents or any of them or otherwise howsoever be restrained from doing or directing, procuring, instigating, causing, enabling or assisting others from passing off or attempting to pass off itself as an authorised distributor and/or dealer of the appellants or either of them and/or of the Products and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, by:
 
(i) misrepresenting that the third respondent is an authorised distributor or dealer of the appellants or either of them and/or of the Products; 
(ii) promoting, distributing, offering for sale or selling any exhaust system under or by reference to the REMUS mark or any colourable imitation thereof without making clear to each and every customer before he or she buys such system that the third respondent is not an authorised distributor or dealer of the appellants or either of them and/or of the Products;
 
until the trial of this action or until further Order.
 15.
 Final claims 
 
To recapitulate the essential claims before the court at the commencement of the trial were: (a). copyright infringement; and
 (b). passing off.
 16.The copyright claim was in respect of the first plaintiffs` catalogue `Power on the Road` and the artistic works contained in the catalogue. At the commencement of the trial however this claim was abandoned even though it was embellished in extravagant terms. Consequently nothing more will be said about it.
 17.That left for trial only the claim founded on passing-off. No action based on trademark was possible because no trademark of the plaintiffs` was registered in Singapore at the material time.
 18.
 Passing off claim: two limbs 
 
The claim based on passing-off had two limbs: The first was related to the alleged act on the part of the defendants misrepresenting themselves as the authorised distributors or dealers of the `REMUS` exhaust systems and misrepresenting that the plaintiffs` warranty was available to the buyers. This allegation involved an implied concession that any `REMUS` products sold by the defendants were not imitation but genuine. This claim is closely related to parallel import and unjust enrichment by taking advantage of the advertisements and promotion of `REMUS` products by the second plaintiffs. It was this alleged sale as authorised distributors that prompted the plaintiffs to advance the contention that the defendants were in `breach of distribution rights` of the second plaintiffs. The second limb was based on imitation `REMUS` products. I shall now consider the first limb.
 19.
 Legitimate parallel import 
 
First a preliminary observation. This claim based on exclusive rights must fail for two reasons. In Singapore there is no tort known as breach of exclusive distribution rights or unfair competition based on exclusive distribution rights. It is a collateral form of attack on parallel import which is perfectly lawful business. In 
Imperial Tobacco Co of India, Ltd v Bonnan
 
[1924] AC 755
 the plaintiffs for some years had been the sole importers and sellers in India of a well-known brand of cigarettes. They were assignees of the trade mark and goodwill for India. The defendants had bought over 21 million of the cigarettes cheaply from purchasers from the manufacturers who had granted the plaintiffs the sole rights for India. The plaintiffs sought to restrain the defendants from importing and selling the cigarettes in India. It was held by the first instance court, an appeal court and the Privy Council that the action was not maintainable in the absence of breach of contract, misrepresentation or infringement. As the cigarettes in dispute were genuine articles, lawfully acquired, from lawful manufacturers the defendants had the liberty to sell them. The case is clear authority for the following propositions: 
Apart from contract or misrepresentation there is nothing to prevent a person from acquiring goods from a manufacturer or his buyer and selling them in competition with him, even in a country into which the manufacturer, or his agent, has been the sole importer and distributor.
 20.The Privy Council thus put its imprimatur on parallel imports simpliciter. In other words no action lies if all that the plaintiff can establish is that he or his agents have developed a goodwill for a particular product in a given territory and that goodwill is being eroded by the sale of the same product by the defendant in the same territory. An infringement of exclusive rights of distributorship is not a recognised cause of action. See also 
Mayor of Bradford v Pickles
 
[1895] AC 587
 and 
Allen v Flood
 
[1898] AC 1
 which affirmed the principle that damage alone is insufficient to found a cause of action even if it results from an evil motive of the defendant. An additional element is necessary, namely, the conduct must be unlawful in this case a deception must be practised.
 21.
 Illegitimate parallel import 
 
In 
Erven Warnink BV & Anor v J Townsend & Sons (Hull) Ltd & Anor
 
[1980] RPC 31
 at p 93 Lord Diplock defined passing-off in the following words: 
 Spalding v Gamage
 and latter cases make it possible to identify five characteristics which must be present in order to create a valid cause of action for passing off: (1) a misrepresentation (2) made by a trader in the course of trade, (3) to prospective customers of his ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader (in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence) and (5) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will probably do so.
 22.The later development of the law shows that a cause of action founded on the tort of passing-off would succeed in the following scenario, that is where a trader who is not an authorised dealer so conducts his business and thereby he gives potential customers the false impression that he can provide the full back-up and after sale service of the manufacturers inducing them to believe that (a) the trader is the authorised dealer and (b) the trader will be in a position to give a manufacturer`s guarantee. See 
Sony KK & Anor v Saray Electronics (London)
 
[1983] FSR 302
, 
Nishika Corp v Goodchild
 
[1990] FSR 371
, and 
Sony of Canada v Hi-Fi Express Inc
 
[1982] 138 DLR (3d) 662
.
 23.In the last of the three cases, Sony of Canada Ltd imported in Canada and distributed through its authorised dealers audio and video equipment bearing its name. They were the exclusive distributors of the equipment having been appointed by the Japanese manufacturers. Theirs was a compound product consisting of four ingredients (a) the chattel itself; (b) point-of-sale service; (c) the warrantee completed by authorised dealer; and (d) after-sale service. I shall call this the (`the compound product principle`). There was evidence to establish that the advertising undertaken by the defendants misled the public into believing that the defendants` product offered for sale was the plaintiffs` product comprising the four ingredients. This damaged the right of the plaintiff to the goodwill of its business. On that basis it was held that the plaintiffs were entitled to protection in a passing off action.
 24.In another Canadian case, 
Consumers Distributing Co Ltd v Seiko Time Canada Ltd
 
[1984] 10 DLR (4th) 161
 the extended version of passing off in the form summarised above was accepted. Estey J of the Supreme Court of Canada said at p 173: 
The role played by the tort of passing off in the common law has undoubtedly expanded to take into account the changing commercial realities in the present-day community. The simple wrong of selling one`s goods deceitfully as those of another is not now the core of the action. It is the protection of the community from the consequential damage of unfair competition or unfair trading.
 On the facts of the case, however, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the conduct of the defendant was not within the extended concept of passing off. It was a simple case of parallel import within the elements of passing-off. An opposite finding by the lower courts was held to be erroneous. In that case the manufacturer was not a party to the proceedings.
 25.Ultimately, therefore, the decision in this case depends on whether on a balance of probabilities there is sufficient evidence to bring the plaintiffs within this extended principle of goodwill for the compound product.
 26.The plaintiffs relied on a receipt issued by the first defendants to Dr Yeong containing the hand-written words `2-year guarantee` in their cash bill dated 6 November 1993. They also alleged that one Spectrum Motor Design Supply purchased `REMUS` exhaust systems from the first defendants with a two year warranty in december 1993. It was further asserted that on 19 January 1994 the second defendants sold one system to one Benjamin Giam with a similar warranty. The case against the defendants was that by doing so they warranted that the product was sold subject to the plaintiffs` warranty as detailed in [para ] 3. This contention has certain factual flaws. first neither of the plaintiffs issued a warranty card setting out the terms of the warranty and stating whose warranty it was. The warranty was part of the plaintiffs` advertisement. It was not always part of the sale of their product. In any event the first plaintiffs gave no warranty in respect to workmanship involved in the installation. Even the advertisement was vague as to its meaning and extent. In point of fact no warranty was issued to Dr Yeong at the time of the sale. It was included in a receipt when he returned and asked for one. In other words the sale preceded the warranty. More importantly the warranty given by Jeep Chee Trading properly understood did not refer directly or indirectly to either of the plaintiffs and was not confined to the product but extended to the workmanship connected with the installation as well. The installation work was done by the first defendants. There was therefore no question of the defendants representing that the warranty given was that of either of the plaintiffs. No evidence of such confusion was adduced. No sane person would understand that as a representation of a warranty by either plaintiff in the sense it was spelt out by the second plaintiffs. The natural expectation of any purchaser in case of a defect would be to go to the seller who wrote the words, namely, the defendants. This applies to all warranties given by the defendants. On the basis the claim against the defendants based on the warranty and loss of goodwill belonging to either plaintiffs must fail.
 27.
 Passing off imitation products 
 
I now come to the case based on the allegation of the plaintiffs` that the defendants were selling imitation `REMUS` products. The genesis of this allegation was the purchase of a `REMUS` exhaust system by one Dr Yeong Kuan Yuen on 6 November 1993. I will call it `Dr Yeong`s silencer`.
 28.Dr Yeong was the owner of a Honda Civic VTI 4-door car. His evidence was that on 28 October 1993 and 5 November 1993 he contacted the defendants to enquire about the purchase and installation of a `REMUS` exhaust system to his car. A lady, Miss Karen Lim, offered a `REMUS` system at $440 on immediate basis and $390 if he could wait a week as the defendants did not have it in their own stock. The system offered on immediate basis was from another shop which was later identified as Team Motoring. Dr Yeong did not wish to wait. He drove his car to the defendants on 6 November 1993 and his car was fitted with a `REMUS` exhaust system at $440. Then he drove to another shop, Hui Auto Trading, who had earlier quoted him a price of $550 for the same product and told them about this purchase at $440. Hui Auto asked for a receipt to show their suppliers. This prodded Dr Yeong to return to the defendants and ask for a receipt. He was given one and it contained these hand-written words: `2 year Guarantee`. Later he went to Hui Auto and tendered the receipt and Hui Auto took a photocopy of the receipt. in February 1994 the second plaintiffs contacted Dr Yeong and informed him that there was a possibility that the `REMUS` system he purchased from the defendants was not genuine and they wanted to investigate the matter and offered a new genuine `REMUS` silencer in exchange for Dr Yeong`s silencer. Dr Yeong accepted the offer and the exchange was effected.
 29.The second plaintiffs sent Dr Yeong`s silencer to the first plaintiffs about a month before the trial. It was part of Mrs Angelika Kresch`s scripted evidence that Dr Yeong`s silencer bore the date `1092` (October 1992) and that the production records of the first plaintiffs revealed there was no production of the exhaust system in question in October 1992. Accordingly Dr Yeong`s silencer was not a `REMUS` exhaust system manufactured by the first plaintiffs. Additionally the first plaintiffs produced an inspection record dated 20 May 1997 which compared the Dr Yeong`s silencer with a system in the first plaintiffs` 1996 stock. Several differences were indicated including the damping material. There were differences in the measurement of some of the parts. The suggestion was that the damping material in Dr Yeong`s silencer was of inferior quality compared to that in the system from the first plaintiffs` 1996 stock. The measurements, it was said, confirmed that it was not the product of the first plaintiffs. It was admitted however that the tail piece of Dr Yeong`s silencer was not counterfeit. As to this, Mrs Angelika Kresch`s explanation was that in 1991 the first plaintiffs supplied tail pipes to one trader in Indonesia. The inference intended was that someone had put together counterfeit systems and attached genuine end parts to pass off the whole system as genuine `REMUS` brand and that the defendants had secured the counterfeit products.
 30.It should be recalled at this point that the defendants had offered a `REMUS` exhaust system to Dr Yeong for $390 whereas the authorised dealer had quoted $550. The question that arose in my mind was: could the defendants offer a genuine system at such a low price? All this made a good initial impression in my mind in favour of the plaintiffs.
 31.Having stated the essence of the plaintiffs` evidence on the counterfeit silencer point I shall now relate the defendants` evidence on this point.
 32.Miss Karen Lim`s evidence was that her quotation of $440 was based on her expectation to obtain the product from Koenig Autostyling, with whom the defendants had a business relationship. When Dr Yeong made his inquiry she quoted low because he made a telephone call and she did not want to lose his custom. Unbeknown to Dr Yeong, later she learnt that Koenig Autostyling did not have the required exhaust system in stock. She was in a predicament because if she told Dr Yeong what happened when he came she might not be believed. So it was decided to get one from an authorised dealer through Team Motoring which was known to her. This time the price was $551. As she had made a commitment at $440 to Dr Yeong the `defendants were ethically bound as a matter of business to honour that quotation`. The defendants therefore made a business decision to supply and install the `REMUS` system obtained by Team Motoring even though they would incur a loss. It was not denied that the words `2 year guarantee` were written by the defendants of their own volition. The defendants said that they were written at the request of Dr Yeong. This discrepancy as I remarked earlier does not go to the root of the issue and I make no finding on who is telling the truth.
 33.If the allegation that Dr Yeong`s silencer was obtained from Hui Auto Trading by Team Motoring the plaintiffs` case of passing off based on alleged sale of a counterfeit system by the defendants must fail.
 34.There was unblemished evidence from Koenig Autostyling to the following effect: (a). They acquired and sold genuine `REMUS` exhaust systems to the defendants and others.
 (b). They sold genuine exhaust systems of the model in question at approximately $440 per set in 1993.
 (c). The contents of the conversation between Karen Lim and them on 5 or 6 November 1993 was accurate - that is to say they agreed to supply at $440 but did not have the silencer in stock.
 35.Additionally I find that Karen Lim was a witness of truth when she asked Ng Wai Choon of Team Motoring to purchase what turned out to be Dr Yeong`s silencer. I also find that Ng Wai Choon was a witness of truth when he said that he purchased it from Hui Auto Trading and supplied it to the defendants.
 36.There are two wrinkles in the evidence of Mr Ng Wai Choon of Team Motoring. First, in the cash invoice of 6 November 1993 he received from Hui Auto Trading he wrote the vehicle number of someone else`s car and not Dr Yeong`s car. He said that this was an error he made due to a confusion with another car. Next was Team Motoring`s invoice bearing the date 16 November 1993 and not 6 november 1993 . He then cancelled it and inserted 6 November 1993 instead. The explanation as to the discrepancy was that when he collected the silencer from Hui Auto Trading and delivered it to the defendants he did not issue a receipt. Later Miss Karen Lim asked for a receipt. So he issued a receipt bearing the date 16 November 1993. Miss Karen Lim, however, wanted the receipt to reflect the date of sale. He agreed and altered the date. This account was corroborated by Miss Karen Lim. She said that when the defendants` consulted their lawyer on 16 November 1993, the latter asked for the receipt evidencing the purchase of Dr Yeong`s silencer from Team Motoring. Hence the receipt dated 16 November 1993. She then wanted the receipt to reflect the date of sale. Team Motoring obliged and altered the date. I questioned Mr Ng Wai Choon intensively and I found him to be a witness of truth. He was a disinterested witness.
 37.The result in a nuthsell is that Dr Yeong`s silencer was not an imitation; it was an authentic piece. I make this without any hesitation and do so notwithstanding the evidence of Mrs Angelika Kresch for the following reasons.
 38.In cross-examination she admitted in evidence that `1092` `date is delivery date and not production date`. This naturally led to an error on the part that there was no production in October 1992. Without noticing the nuance she was repeating the error ad nausem. There was evidence to the effect that other genuine exhaust systems with the date `1092` were in the market as revealed by evidence adduced by the defendants.
 39.There was another egregious defect in the case of the plaintiffs. They compared Dr Yeong`s silencer with a 1996 exhaust system and not one produced in 1992. The defendants on the other hand produced to court genuine exhaust systems marketed in 1993 which bore evidence of the same measurements as that of Dr Yeong`s silencer. This clearly belied Mrs Angelika Kresch`s evidence that they never produced exhaust systems with the critical measurements of Dr Yeong`s silencer. Mrs Angelika Kresch`s evidence was self-serving and the onus was on the plaintiffs to prove that the defendants sold imitation. In the end the plaintiffs abjectly failed to establish this.
 40.Furthermore, it struck me highly improbable that for a profit of about $100 per piece an imitator would take the trouble of making a small number of counterfeit exhaust systems. Imitation trade does not operate that way. It was also unlikely that from 1993 to 1997, when this trial was heard, no other allegedly counterfeit exhaust system was found, let alone a factory manufacturing such counterfeits. The allegation that Dr Yeong`s silencer was a counterfeit was weak and appeared to be an afterthought in consequence of the collapse of the other causes of action.
 41.The result is that the plaintiffs` claims failed and the action was dismissed with costs.",1998-06-30 00:00:00,SG High Court

CHAO HICK TIN J
 This is an action instituted by the plaintiffs (Wiltopps) against the defendants, a firm of solicitors, for damages for breach of duty and/or negligence, as solicitors for the plaintiffs, in the conduct of proceedings in relation to the arrest and release of a vessel.
 2.
 Background 
 
In November 1980 Wiltopps, through their Japanese solicitor, Hiratsuka, retained the defendants (M/s Emmanuel & Barker) as solicitors to institute admiralty proceedings in Singapore with a view to arresting any vessel belonging to Kyodogumi Co Ltd of Japan (KDG). The claim by Wiltopps against KDG was for damages for breach of a towage contract dated 2 February 1979 as well as for reimbursement of certain sums advanced by Wiltopps to KDG. Pursuant to the towage contract the tug SUMI MARU 9001 (SM 9001) was to tow two bulk carriers, the Clytia and Michael Carras, from Greece to Taiwan for scrapping. En route, SM 9001 abandoned its tow. On 29 January 1981, M/s Emmanuel & Barker instituted Admiralty in Rem No 68 (admiralty action) and two days later procured the arrest of SM 9001 in Singapore. The solicitor in the firm handling the matter was Mr Gregory Emmanuel.
 3.Towards the last week of February 1981 there were negotiations with a view to providing security for the release of the vessel. Wiltopps` claim against KDG was for the sums of 670,000 and US$192,500, plus interest and costs. I do not propose at this juncture to set out in detail the negotiations. On 26 February 1981, M/s Drew & Napier submitted a guarantee which they issued on behalf of the Japan Shipowners Mutual Protection and Indemnity Association (`the P&I Club`) providing cover for up to US$238,700 and 830,000 (inclusive of interest at 8% for three years on the two sums claimed) and S$30,000 for costs. Eventually on 27 February 1981 a bail bond for the said sum was filed in court by KDG`s Singapore solicitors, M/s Drew & Napier. On the same day, upon advice, Wiltopps accepted the bail bond and SM 9001 was released.
 4.The admiralty action came up for hearing in 1985 and 1986 and it was dismissed on 12 November 1986. Wiltopps appealed against the dismissal of the action. Thereafter, there were other interlocutory proceedings, which I need not go into, so much so that the appeal only came up for hearing in 1992. By a judgment dated 13 November 1992, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and judgment was entered for Wiltopps. Under this judgment, Wiltopps were entitled to recover damages (with interest at 11%) totalling 1,211,437.12. Wiltopps` costs of the action far exceeded S$30,000. Wiltopps recovered only the sums secured under the bail bond. Wiltopps could not recover anything at all from KDG, as the latter had in the meantime been wound up.
 5.The complaint of Wiltopps in this action concerned the interest and costs components provided in the bail bond. Wiltopps say that M/s Emmanuel & Barker should have asked for an open-ended bond, without specifying any sums in so far as interest and costs were concerned. Wiltopps contend that M/s Emmanuel & Barker did not excise sufficient care and diligence when they advised Wiltopps to accept the bail bond instead of allowing it to be decided by the Registrar. Wiltopps averred in the amended statement of claim that: 
(M/s Emmanuel & Barker) knew or ought to have ascertained about the nature of the claim and the likely issues, and having regard to the defendants` knowledge that the plaintiffs anticipated a long battle on the issue of abandonment, the defendants ought reasonably to have anticipated that the action might well involve an application for summary judgment and that an eventual trial might well involve four or five witnesses of fact and at least one or two expert witnesses on each side. On that basis, the defendants ought reasonably to have anticipated that the trial could well last for many days and not come on for hearing until well after three years. In those circumstances, the defendants ought not to have taken interest at a rate of 8% per annum for three years without also considering that the plaintiffs` claim is for a sum in foreign currencies. In addition, the defendants ought reasonably to have estimated that in those circumstances, the plaintiffs` costs of the action, taxed on a party and party basis, would be likely to far exceed S$30,000.
 6.
 Limitation 
 
The writ in the present action was only filed on 27 May 1995. Thus, the first defence raised by M/s Emmanuel & Barker is that of limitation, ie that Wiltopps` claims herein is barred by s 6(1) of the Limitation Act. That subsection provides: 
Subject to this Act, the following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued:
 
(a) actions founded on a contract or on tort.
 7.Wiltopps have conceded that their claim founded in contract is barred. The only question is whether their claim in tort is also barred. M/s Emmanuel & Barker accept that negligence is not actionable per se; there must be proof of damage.
 8.The position taken by Wiltopps is that their cause of action in tort did not accrue and could not have accrued until the judgment of the Court of Appeal against KDG was delivered on 13 November 1992 (the CA judgment). This action, having been commenced on 27 May 1995, is within the six-year limitation period reckoned from 13 November 1992. Wiltopps suffered no relevant damage which was certain or quantifiable before the CA judgment had been given and KDG had failed to pay.
 9.M/s Emmanuel & Barker accept that a cause of action in negligence accrues when actual damage is suffered but contend that in the present case that occurred when: (i). SM 9001 was released from arrest on 27 February 1981; or
 (ii). the period of three years, for which interest was secured by the bail bond, expired on 26 February 1984; or
 (iii). the plaintiffs sometime in 1986/87 knew that their own costs would exceed the sum of S$30,000 secured by the bail bond.
 So the critical question in this connection is when did the cause of action in tort accrue to Wiltopps.
 10.It is settled law that a cause of action for the tort of negligence only arises when there has been a breach of duty resulting in actual, as opposed to potential or prospective loss or damage. In 
Hopkins v Mackenzie
 
[1994] TLR 546
 Saville LJ said `what had to be shown was actual loss or damage, not future loss or damage, however likely it was that that would occur.` While the law is clear, and easily stated, its application to particular circumstances, especially where economic losses are involved, is often difficult as the following cases will show.
 11.In 
Forster v Outred
 
[1982] 1 WLR 86
, the plaintiff in February 1973 executed a mortgage of her property in the presence of her solicitors as security for a loan made by a company to her son, who subsequently became a bankrupt. In January 1975, the plaintiff, following a demand made by the company in April 1974, repaid the loan. The English Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff had suffered actual damage through the solicitors` negligence by executing a mortage deed whereby her property was encumbered with a legal charge and she was subjected to a liability which might mature into a financial loss and therefore her cause of action accrued in February 1973 notwithstanding that she did not actually become liable for the repayment of the loan until the demand was made. Stephenson LJ said (at p 98): 
... the plaintiff has suffered actual damage through the negligence of her solicitors by entering into the mortgage deed, the effect of which has been to encumber her interest in her freehold estate with this legal charge and subject her to a liability which may, according to matters completely outside her control, mature into financial loss - as indeed it did. It seems to me that the plaintiff did suffer actual damage in those ways; and subject to that liability and with that encumbrance on the mortgage property was then entitled to claim damages, not, I would think, an indemnity and probably not a declaration, for the alleged negligence of the solicitor which she alleges caused her that damage. In those circumstances her cause of action was complete on February 8, 1973, and the writ which she issued on March 25, 1980, was issued too late to come within the six years` period of limitation.
 12.Dunn LJ who gave the second leading judgment in the case, while noting that the plaintiff was under no liability to the mortgagee to repay her son`s overdraft until a demand had been made under the mortgage, felt that a cause of economic loss should be distinguished from that based on physical and material damage. He felt that in cases of financial or economic loss the damage crystallized and the cause of action was complete at the date when the plaintiff, in reliance on negligent advice, acted to his detriment. He explained (at p 100) as follows: 
In this case, as soon as she executed the mortgage the plaintiff not only became liable under its express terms but also - and more importantly - 
 the value of the equity of redemption of her property was reduced
. Before she executed the mortgage deed she owned the property free from encumbrances; thereafter she became the owner of a property subject to a mortgage. 
 That, in my view, was a quantifiable loss and as from that date her cause of action against her solicitor was complete, because at that date she had suffered damage.
 The actual quantum of damages would, of course, depend on events between that date and the date when the damages had finally to be assessed, but the cause of action was complete when she executed the mortgage, without proof of special damage. [Emphasis added.]
 13.In 
Baker v Ollard & Bentley
 
[1982] 126 SJ 593
 the plaintiff acquired a share in a property, rather than, as she ought to have received, the security of a long lease of one floor of the property. The amount of her loss would depend on the attitude of her co-owners. The Court of Appeal held that the damage was suffered by the plaintiff at the time of the conveyance, when she received her lessor interest, and not at a later date when problems arose. Templeman LJ disposed of the plaintiff`s argument against time-bar as follows: 
It was submitted that the plaintiff did not suffer damage on 12 April 1973 because she might have been left undisturbed in her occupation of the first floor and value of her interest in the house, 49 per cent of the eventual proceeds of sale, would have exceeded the sale value of a long lease of the first floor, an interest she should have acquired had the solicitors not been negligent. But on 12 April 1973 the plaintiff did not receive that which the solicitors ought to have obtained for her and she, therefore, suffered damage on that date. The fact that the quantum of damages then suffered by the plaintiff could only be established by ascertaining the attitude and intentions of Mr and Mrs B only went to quantum and did not affect the fact that the damages were suffered on 12 April 1973.
 14.
 Forster v Outred 
 was applied in 
DW Moore v Ferrier
 
[1988] 1 WLR 267
 where the defendant`s solicitors negligently prepared and advised the execution of an agreement containing an unenforceable covenant against competition. Notwithstanding that the damage actually complained of was not suffered until much later and was dependant on two contingencies, the Court of Appeal held that there was a cause of action for some measurable loss which occurred when the defective contract containing the unenforceable covenant was executed. Neill LJ put the rationale in this way (at p 277): 
It is necessary to remember what it was that the plaintiffs in the instant case were seeking to obtain. A valid restrictive covenant, if it is not personal solely to the covenantee, can be assigned to a purchaser of the goodwill of a business. To my mind, it does not require evidence to establish that such a covenant has some value, particularly when it is given in the context of a broking business where personal contacts may be of particular importance.
 15.The decisions in 
 Forster v Outred 
, 
 DW Moore v Ferrier 
 and 
 Baker v Ollard 
 were applied in 
Bell v Peter Browne & Co
 
[1990] 3 All ER 124
 where solicitors failed to protect their client`s, the husband`s, interest upon the transfer of the matrimonial home to the wife upon divorce. It was agreed between the husband and wife that the husband was to have 1/6 share in the gross proceeds of sale and it was to be protected by a trust deed or mortgage. No trust deed was prepared by the solicitors. Eight years later the wife sold the house and spent the proceeds. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff had suffered damage in tort when the solicitors failed to prepare a declaration of trust because he had suffered prejudice in entering into the transfer without the benefit of the protection of a declaration of trust. Mustill LJ felt the loss was actual and not potential (at p 136): 
The transaction caused Mr Bell to exchange his valid legal estate for an equitable interest in the proceeds of sale which was dependent on the goodwill and solvency of the wife unless and until protected by a formal declaration of trust and the lodging of a caution. The failure to see that these steps were taken promptly mean that Mr Bell was actually, and just potentially, worse off than if the solicitor had performed his task competently.
 16.The main case relied upon by Wiltopps to say that time does not begin to run against them until the CA judgment on 13 November 1992 was the Australian High Court case of 
Wardley Australia v State of Western Australia
 
[1992] 109 ALR 247
 which concerned an indemnity executed by the respondent in favour of a bank on account of misleading and deceptive conduct on the part of the appellant. Under the indemnity, before the bank could call on the indemnity, the primary debtor must have failed to satisfy its liability. In a joint judgment of four of the seven-member High Court, they said (p 252): 
The indemnity was not one of a kind which generates an immediate non-contingent liability to pay upon execution of the instrument. It was neither a promise to meet a liability of the promisee to make a payment nor a promise to pay a debt owing by a third party to the promisee. In our view the indemnity, on its true construction, was one which created a liability on the part of the respondent to the bank to make payment if and when the bank`s relevant `net loss` was ascertained and quantified, subject to the making of a demand for payment by the bank. The liability was, therefore, in conformity with the opinion of the Full Court, contingent and executory. The likelihood, perhaps the virtual certainty, that there would be a loss, in the light of Rothwell`s actual financial position as it stood when the indemnity was executed, did not transform the liability into an actual or present liablity at that time.
 And, at pp 254-255, their Honours further amplified the issue of economic loss as follows: 
Economic loss may take a variety of forms and, as Gaudron J noted in 
 Hawkins v Clayton
, the answer to the question when a cause of action for negligence causing economic loss accrues may require consideration of the precise interest infringed by the negligent act or omission. The kind of economic loss which is sustained and the time when it is first sustained depend upon the nature of the interest infringed and, perhaps, the nature of the interference to which it is subjected.
 
With economic loss, as with other forms of damage, there has to be some actual damage. Prospective loss is not enough.
 
When a plaintiff is induced by a misrepresentation to enter into an agreement which is, or proves to be, to his or her disadvantage, the plaintiff sustains a detriment in a general sense on entry into the agreement. That is because the agreement subjects the plaintiff to obligations and liabilities which exceed the value or worth of the rights and benefits which it confers upon the plaintiff. But, as will appear shortly, detriment in this general sense has not universally been equated with the legal concept of `loss or damage`. And that is just as well. In many instances the disadvantageous character or effect of the agreement cannot be ascertained until some future date when its impact upon events as they unfold becomes known or apparent and, by then, the relevant limitation period may have expired. To compel a plaintiff to institute proceedings before the existence of his or her loss is ascertained or ascertainable would be unjust. Moreover, it would increase the possibility that the courts would be forced to estimate damages on the basis of likelihood or probability instead of assessing damages by reference to established events. In such a situation, there would be an ever-present risk of undercompensation or overcompensation, the risk of the former being the greater.
 17.Their Honours distinguished 
 Forster v Outred 
 on the basis that there, upon the execution of the mortgage, there was an immediate effect on the value of the plaintiff`s equity of redemption.
 18.Deane J, who gave his own separate judgment, explained in this way why there was no loss or damage at the time of entering into the indemnity (at p 267): 
On the other hand, as a matter of ordinary language, no relevant loss or damage actually came home to the State at the time it executed the indemnity. The detriment to which the State subjected itself at that stage was the risk or (in view of the falseness of the representations) greater risk that it would come under an actual liability to make a payment of money if a possible or (in view of the falseness of the representations) probable factual situation came about. If the course of subsequent developments had been different (eg, if the bill facility had not been utilized; if Rothwells had subsequently prospered or been taken over and financially revived; or if no timeous steps had been taken to place it in liquidation after payment by Rothwells of the full amount owing to the bank), the State may never have sustained any actual financial loss at all. In the event, the factual developments which ultimately turned the risk of future loss or damage into the reality of a loss of $22.5m involved a combination of circumstances, including the presentation of a petition for the winding-up of Rothwells within six months of the repayment by Rothwells to the bank of the whole of the amount due under the credit line facility. On balance, it seems to me that the mere assumption of such an isolated and truly contingent liability did not give rise to a factual situation within the prima facie meaning of the words `suffers loss or damage` until the stage was reached where subsequent events gave rise to actual or certain liability or other actual or certain financial detriment (eg a payment made to escape from the contingent liability).
 19.In 
UBAF Ltd v European American Banking Corp
 
[1984] QB 713
 at p 725, where the plaintiff participated in a syndicated loan to two Panamanian companies on account of the misrepresentations of the defendant, Ackner LJ said: 
The mere fact that the innocent but negligent misrepresentations caused the plaintiffs to enter into a contract which they otherwise would not have entered into, does not inevitably mean that they had suffered damage by merely entering into the contract.
 Ackner LJ distinguished 
 Forster v Outred 
 on the basis that when the mother executed the mortgage deed, she suffered some damage when she encumbered her freehold interest and reduced the value of her property.
 20.In 
Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett, Stubbs & Kemp
 
[1978] 3 All ER 571
 there a solicitor drew an option to purchase land but failed to register it as an estate contract under the Land Charges Act 1925. Some six years later the optionor conveyed the land to his wife. Two months after the conveyance was effected, the optionee sought to exercise the option and discovered that the land had in the meantime been conveyed. The optionee brought an action for negligence against the solicitor in both contract and tort. Oliver J held that the claim in tort was not time-barred because the cause of action only accrued when the damage occurred in August 1967 upon the conveyance of the land by the optionor to his wife. Perhaps this case can be reconciled with 
 Forster v Outred 
 on the basis that there was, until the optionor conveyed the land to his wife, continuing breach of duty on the solicitor`s part to have the option registered.
 21.More recent English cases would appear to veer in the direction of the Australian position. In 
Hopkins v Mackenzie
 
[1994] TLR 546
 the plaintiff`s claim against a hospital for medical negligence was struck out for want of prosecution. The Court of Appeal held that the cause of action in tort against the solicitors accrued only when the original claim was struck out and not earlier. The court did not accept the argument that the cause of action accrued when the solicitors` delay was such that the original claim would inevitably be struck out.
 22.In 
First National Commercial Bank plc v Humberts
 
[1995] 2 All ER 673
, the bank in July 1983 agreed to finance the development of certain land which was to be leased from a local authority. The advances were to be secured on the lease. The valuers valued the future worth of the lease at 4.4m and the bank made advances totalling 2.6m to the developers. Later the developers became insolvent and the security proved insufficient to repay the advances. On 20 March 1990 the bank sued the valuers claiming damages for negligence alleging that the worth of the lease was only 2.7m. On a preliminary point of law, the High Court ruled that the claim in negligence was time-barred. This was reversed on appeal. The English Court of Appeal noted that the date of the first advance was in July 1983 and the bank could not have proved that they had suffered any actual loss until some date subsequent to March 1984, within six years of the date the action was instituted. In March 1984, the security, even taking its value to be 2.7m, still exceeded the aggregate sums advanced by the bank. Saville LJ distinguished 
 Forster v Outred 
 and 
 Bell v Peter Browne & Co 
 as follows (at p 679): 
At the hearing and in the judgment much reliance was placed on the cases where the claimant entered into a transaction which through a breach of duty owed to the claimant provided the claimant with less rights than should have been secured, or imposed liabilities or obligations on the claimant which should not have been imposed. Examples of these cases are: 
Forster v Outred & Co (a firm)
 
[1982] 2 All ER 753
[1982] 1 WLR 86
, 
Iron Trade Mutual Insurance Co Ltd v JK Buckenham Ltd
 
[1990] 1 All ER 808
 and 
Bell v Peter Browne & Co (a firm)
 
[1990] 3 All ER 124
[1990] 2 QB 495
. In all those cases, however, the court was able to conclude that the transaction then and there caused the claimant loss, on the basis that if the injured party had been put in the position he would have occupied but for the breach of duty, the transaction in question would have provided greater rights, or imposed lesser liabilities or obligations than was the case; and that the difference between these two states of affairs could be quantified in money terms at the date of the transaction. By contrast, in the present case, as in 
UBAF Ltd v European American Banking Corp
 
[1984] 2 All ER 226
[1984] QB 713
 (and indeed 
Wardley Australia Ltd v State of Western Australia
 
[1992] 109 ALR 247
) it seems to me that whichever of the legally recognised kinds of loss is examined, it is impossible on the material available to conclude that the plaintiffs suffered such loss at any time more than six years from the date of their writ. For the reasons given, it has not been shown that they lost the amount of their advances at that time, or incurred expenses in respect of which they were out of pocket at that time; or at that time lost other transactions or the opportunity to make other transactions of a value greater than the deal they made.
 23.From all these cases one conclusion seems inevitable: it is often not easy to determine at which point in time damage occurs. It seems very much to depend on the angle you are looking from. Neither is it possible to reconcile all the cases, as was recognised by Neill LJ when he made these observations in 
 Humberts 
 (at p 680): 
As was recognised by the High Court of Australia in 
Wardley Australia Ltd v State of Western Australia
 
[1992] 109 ALR 247
 at 254 economic loss may take a variety of forms, and the answer to the question when a cause of action for negligence causing economic loss accrues may require consideration of the precise interest infringed by the negligent act or omission. It may also require consideration of the nature of the interference to which the interest is subjected. Some of the cases to which we were referred in the course of argument, however, demonstrate that the courts have been driven to draw narrow, and some would say unconvincing, distinctions between transactions where it has been held that the loss was measurable when the relevant transaction was entered into and transactions where it has been held that the loss occasioned by the unsatisfactory bargain lay in the future.
 24.It appears to me that there is a conflict between the Australian cases and some of the English cases as to whether, for the purposes of a limitation provision, the mere incurring of a contingent liability to make a monetary payment in the future suffices to give rise to a cause of action for which loss or damage is a necessary ingredient. It could be said that in our present action, the alleged negligence gave rise to a less valuable indemnity. But by its very nature the indemnity here could only be invoked where two contingencies had come to pass: (i) Wiltopps have obtained a judgment or a settlement in their favour and (ii) KDG was not able to satisfy it. It was not a primary obligation. Another distinguishing feature, as compared with 
 Forster v Outred 
, is that here Wiltopps were not the party giving the indemnity, they were the beneficiaries under the indemnity. At the time when Wiltopps agreed to release the vessel on accepting the bail bond, no relevant loss or damage had yet been suffered by them until a judgment (or a settlement) was obtained by them against KDG which remained unsatisfied. The situation here is unlike that in 
 Forster v Outred 
 and is more akin to that in 
 Wardley 
.
 25.In fact, I see force in the argument that in 
 Forster v Outred 
 the mother did not really lose anything when she executed the mortgage. Of course, she put herself at risk should her son default. It was only on her son`s default that she was called upon to make good. To say that upon execution of the mortgage she had suffered an actual loss seems to me quite artificial.
 26.Be that as it may, even if I should have to apply 
 Forster v Outred 
 and 
 DW Moore v Ferrier 
, the present case is different from them. Whereas in those cases upon signing the documents it could be said the plaintiffs lost something, though the extent of the loss had yet to be ascertained, the same cannot be said here. The indemnity/undertaking was specific - payable only upon certain eventualities which might not occur. Until that happened it is difficult to see how it could be said that the plaintiffs have suffered a loss/damage. A cause of action only accrues when, but not before, all the elements necessary to support the plaintiff`s claim are in existence.
 27.In my judgment a good test to determine whether a cause of action in tort has accrued is to ask whether a plaintiff would have succeeded if he had sued at any time after the occurrence of the negligent act complained of. It seems to me clear that if Wiltopps were to have instituted an action against M/s Emmanuel & Barker for the alleged negligence they would be met with the defence that the claim was premature because Wiltopps would not be able to call on the bail bond until they have obtained a judgment, or a settlement, against KGD, which remained unsatisfied.
 28.Counsel for the defendants has argued that if Wiltopps had sued M/s Emmanuel & Barker within the limitation period from February 1981, the measure of damages for the plaintiffs would have been the difference between the adequate security and the alleged inadequate security. I do not think this can be correct. The bail bond was only a security. It would be wrong to award the difference as damages to the plaintiffs. It was not something to benefit Wiltopps in any event. I accept that the difference could be the damage which might be suffered by Wiltopps. But until Wiltopps obtained a judgment which remained unsatisfied, Wiltopps would not as yet have suffered any damage. Wiltopps could very well have failed in the admiralty action, as it did at first instance. I cannot see any rational basis for granting Wiltopps any damages until it obtained a judgment which remained unsatisfied.
 29.It is true that by the end of February 1984 it would have been apparent to Wiltopps that the interest provision of three years was inadequate. Indeed soon after the tug was released, Wiltopps felt that the interest rate of 8% worked out for the bail bond was low. But at that point in time the loss of Wiltopps was, at best, only contingent. Wiltopps could not draw on any security provided (whatever the amount) until they obtained a judgment or a settlement which KDG could not satisfy.
 30.In my view the reasoning in Wardley is more apt to this case and I would adopt the same. Accordingly, I hold that M/s Emmanuel & Barker`s plea of limitation fails.
 31.
 Were solicitors negligent? 
 
Had Wiltopps not accepted the bail bond filed by M/s Drew & Napier, the owners of SM 9001 would have to apply to court for the release of the vessel and the court would have to determine the adequacy of the bail bond. However, any delay on the release of a vessel under arrest caused by the unreasonable position taken by Wiltopps could give rise to liability. As stated by Hill J in 
The Charlotte
 
[1920] P 78 at 80
 `if it turns out that the plaintiffs have made an exorbitant demand for bail they may suffer for it hereafter.`
 32.The substantive question for me to decide is whether M/s Emmanuel & Barker were guilty of the tort of negligence when they advised Wiltopps to accept the bail bond based on an interest calculation for three years at 8% on the capital sums claimed plus cost of S$30,000.
 33.I should, before going further into the question whether M/s Emmanuel & Barker had failed to exercise reasonable care, examine the assertion made by M/s Emmanuel & Barker that in accepting the bail bond, Wiltopps were exercising their independent judgment in consultation with their Japanese solicitor, Mr Hiratsuka. For me to deal with this point, there is a need to go into the correspondence.
 34.Following a tip-off on 9 January 1981 from Hiratsuka, M/s Emmanuel & Barker filed the admiralty action and had the tug SM 9001 arrested on 31 January 1981. On 4 February 1981, Hiratsuka informed M/s Emmanuel & Barker that `KDG seem to have been in difficulty in arranging security.` On 11 February 1981, Wiltopps asked Emmanuel to discuss with Hiratsuka on the question whether Wiltopps could arrest other KDG`s tugs outside Japan. On the same day Emmanuel informed Wiltopps that the P&I Club had instructed M/s Drew & Napier to act for SM 9001. Emmanuel also advised Wiltopps that it would not be possible to arrest other tugs of KDG.
 35.On 18 February 1981 Emmanuel telexed the following message to Hiratsuka and copied it to Wiltopps: 
Present position here is that there has been no attempt by KDG to furnish security and we understand that first and second mortgagees are getting concerned about situation and may well intervene in the arrest action to protect their interests. If this is so, they will enjoy priority to our claim and Wiltopps could find themselves disbursing monthly amounts of about S$3,000 per month for security guard`s wages until judgment is obtained and the vessel is sold. No doubt Willtopps will get these disbursements back but it will see heavy outlay which will only benefit the mortgagees in the end.
 
Furthermore, indicators from Drew & Napier at the moment are that they will be disputing liability for the abandonment of the tows. If it is going to be a long drawn out battle, the vessel could continue to remain under arrest until the date of the trial (which could be about three years).
 
The best thing I think now is to speak to KDG and try and get some form of settlement even if it means on a deferred payment or instalment basis (with, of course, adequate guarantees).
 36.On 20 February 1981 Hiratsuka telexed Wiltopps, and copied to Emmanuel, the following: (i). KDG`s attorney told Hiratsuka that the owners could provide a P&I guarantee for 670,000 but not for the return of the advanced payment. Hiratsuka would endeavour to make the guarantee cover the advanced payment as well. Hiratsuka sensed that there was no hope of having the guaranteed sum increased and he considered it `advisable to accept the amount ... taking into account the fact that the total of the mortgages on the SM 9001 are in excess of Yen 800 million whereas its value is said to be about Yen 700 million.`
 (ii). he wished to have Emmanuel`s comments whether it was better to have the guarantee subject to Singapore or Japanese jurisdiction. He asked if Harold Choy could fly to Singapore to explain the background of the case to help Emmanuel decide the jurisdictional point.
 (iii). he asked Emmanuel what was the `limitation figure under Singapore law`.
 37.On the same day Emmanuel replied stating that as the arrest was done in Singapore he was quite happy to continue with Singapore jurisdiction. On 23 February 1981, in response to an inquiry from Hiratsuka, Emmanuel expressed fair confidence in succeeding in the action in Singapore. A little later the same day Wiltopps wrote to Hiratsuka and copied to Emmanuel asking (i) whether it was Singapore or Japanese jurisdiction which would give Wiltopps a more favourable position; (ii) confirmation that `from other source our claim should not be subject to limitation.` Still later the same day Hiratsuka despatched two telexes to Wiltopps, and copied to Emmanuel, in the first stating inter alia, it was his impression that Singapore procedures might take slightly longer than Japanese procedures and that Japanese limitation figures were about 10% higher than Singapore`s and in the second, advising that the P&I Club was prepared to issue a guarantee for the full claim subject to Singapore jurisdiction or they would post security in Singapore to obtain the release of the vessel. Hiratsuka also posed a jurisdictional query to Emmanuel. To this latter query Emmanuel replied the same day stating that if security were posted in Singapore it should be subject to Singapore jurisdiction. Emmanuel also stated that KDG`s lawyers in Singapore had indicated that they would not want Japanese jurisdiction.
 38.There was thereafter further correspondence on the jurisdictional point which I do not propose to go into.
 39.On 26 February 1981 M/s Drew & Napier, acting for the P&I Club, submitted a draft guarantee for Emmanuel`s consideration. The draft provided for a total limit of liability as follows: 
provided always that our entire liability hereunder shall not exceed the aggregate of US$238,700 and 830,000, which includes claim for interest, plus a further sum of S$30,000 for costs.
 The period adopted for interest calculation was three years. In forwarding the draft to Wiltopps, and copied to Hiratsuka, Emmanuel stated that `this is a more or less standard form of Club guarantee.`
 40.On the same day M/s Drew & Napier forwarded a formally executed letter of undertaking in those terms to Emmanuel, with a request that the tug be released that same day as a matter of urgency. Emmanuel notified Wiltopps of it (and copied to Hiratsuka) and sought instruction. Wiltopps raised certain technical queries with Emmanuel for advice (copied to Hiratsuka), including how good was a P&I Club guarantee, and told Emmanuel not to release the vessel. Nothing was raised on the question of the adequacy of interest or costs. Emmanuel duly gave his advice on those points, ending his message with these words: 
We must add that we now have both a guarantee and the vessel under arrest. You should elect to retain one or the other and fairly promptly at that. If you feel the guarantee is not acceptable then we should return it to KDG`s lawyers.
 41.On 27 February 1981 or 0850 hours M/s Drew & Napier`s telexed the following message to Emmanuel: 
Please take notice that unless the `Sumi Maru 9001` is released by 11am this morning we shall file an application to the court to be heard today for the release of the vessel and payment of damages for wrongful refusal to release the vessel.
 
If the vessel is not released today the owners of the `Sumi Maru 9001` will suffer immense loss and the claim against your clients may be astronomical.
 42.At about an hour later Emmanuel conveyed the message to Wiltopps (copied to Hiratsuka) stating `please instruct by return whether to release the guarantee back or the vessel.` At 1025 hours Hiratsuka telexed Wiltopps (copied to Emmanuel) stating that he did not think Wiltopps could gain anything by deferring the decision and strongly recommended Wiltopps to accept the guarantee and to instruct Emmanuel to release the vessel. At 1030 hours Wiltopps replied, raising a host of queries, among which were: (i). assuming Wiltopps declined the guarantee, what steps could be taken by KDG to get the vessel released;
 (ii). should we not protect ourselves against the possibility that the final judgment might exceed the guaranteed figure.
 Wiltopps also asked `Can P&I Club explain why 8% ... seems very low`. This query seems to me to be meant for Hiratsuka to take up with the P&I Club or KDG as ten minutes later (at 1040 hours) Wiltopps asked Hiratsuka to convey the following message to KDG and their lawyers: 
Yesterday the lawyer representing your P&I Club have proposed wording of the guarantee, later in the day, tender the guarantee to our lawyer in Singapore for our acceptance.
 
As you know, surprise if you don`t, that we have right to reject this guarantee. So far we have not yet decided whether to accept or not due to complexity of the matter involved. But we will not delay in declaring whether to accept or not and decision will be made as soon as possible after full consultation with our lawyers its legal implication and effect of such guarantee. We hope you will bare with us for a while in order (for) us to decide [sic]. In the event that a decision be made you will be refrained from claiming against us in the delay in declaring our option as you probably well aware, surprise if you don`t, that your proposal are running the risk of being rejected. If so far you are not aware of the option open to us we suggest you immediately consult your lawyer.
 43.At 1155 hours Wiltopps again raised numerous queries with Hiratsuka, among which, was to find out whether it would be better to proceed by way of arbitration in Japan as provided in the towage contract.
 44.At 1430 hours Wiltopps telexed Emmanuel, and copied to Hiratsuka, querying the efficacy of a P&I Club guarantee and making a suggestion how it could be made more acceptable. In the meantime M/s Drew & Napier filed a bail bond with the High Court in identical terms to those in the letter of undertaking and at 1440 hours Emmanuel was advised of it. Four minutes later, Emmanuel informed Wiltopps of that, adding `since a bail bond has been filed in court you must now release the tug, repeat you must release the tug now. Please respond immediately.`
 45.At about 1500 hours (that same day) Emmanuel called Harold Choy of Wiltopps on the telephone. I have no doubt that in that conversation Emmanuel`s advice to Choy was to accept the bail bond. Emmanuel was obviously concerned about possible liability for delay as earlier at 1040 hours Wiltopps had telexed Hiratsuka to convey a message to KDG where it was clear that Wiltopps were concerned of liability on that score. At 1535 hours, Wiltopps telexed stating they would `accept the release of the tug immediately provided that the court will grant the release of the tug and the court is satisfied with the bail bond provided.` Wiltopps also asked Emmanuel to reply to the queries in their telex of 1030 hours. Subsequently, at about 1545 hours, Emmanuel consented to the release of the tug.
 46.In the light of the events I have detailed above, while it is true that Wiltopps agreed to the release of the vessel, it was really pursuant to the advice of both Emmanuel and Hiratsuka. Implicit in Emmanuel`s advice to Wiltopps to accept the bail bond was the opinion that the sum guaranteed is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. I hold that Mr Hiratsuka also held that view. Of course it is true that on matters such as, the waiting period for trial in Singapore and costs to be sought, they are matters very much within the knowledge of Emmanuel. If the amounts offered on those aspects were grossly inadequate it would be Emmanuel`s duty to negotiate for better terms. But the circumstances of the case must always be borne in mind in determining whether the sums were fair and reasonable.
 47.I will now turn to examine the evidence as to whether Emmanuel had breached that duty of care expected of a reasonably competent solicitor. Wiltopps called Mr Anthony Purdon Godwin, who was a senior partner of M/s Donaldson & Burkinshaw from 1964 to 1979. In 1979 he founded his own firm M/s Godwin & Co. He retired from legal practice in Singapore in 1989. He said the basic principle is that security should be in an amount sufficient to cover the claim, plus interest and costs, on the basis of the plaintiff`s reasonably arguable best case. A vessel cannot be re-arrested if the security turned out to be inadequate. In determining that, the nature and difficulties of the case and the expenses which were likely to be incurred, including the expenses of seafarers, who move around the world and who might be required to testify in court, must be borne in mind. In his view, the period of three years for which interest was calculated for the purposes of the bail bond was inadequate. M/s Emmanuel & Barker should have asked for a longer period and `if possible arrived at a figure covering five to six years.` In cross-examination he said the five to six years would cover any appeal too. He was not aware of any general practice in 1981 to limit demand for security to include only three to four years` interest. Each case had to be considered on its facts. He said it was not uncommon in the 1980s for a case like this to take five to six years to come to trial. He felt that the sum of S$30,000 for costs was a `grossly underestimated amount`. He would only agree to a minimum of $75,000. He even went so far as to say that `an appeal should have been contemplated in assessing costs`. When asked if this was a complicated admiralty case, he replied it was an unusual case.
 48.Mr Chandran Arul, an advocate and solicitor since 1963, testified for M/s Emmanuel & Barker. His practice has been mainly in the area of admiralty laws. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief Arul stated: 
In my experience from the mid 70s to the 80s, it was reasonable to expect that a matter will be brought to court within three to four years from the date the action was commenced. Any appeal therefrom will be disposed within two years. The practice of the court was to grant interest on any claim at between 6% to 8%. In my experience any party who arrests a vessel will usually demand security for the claim together with interest at 6% to 8% pa for three to four years and costs of up to S$30,000.
 He accepted in cross-examination that the amount for security for costs would have to depend on the complexity of the case. On the question of an open-ended bond on interest and costs, Arul said that as far as 1981 was concerned, he did not know of any case where such an open-ended bond was ever given; in the nineties there could have been some such open-ended bonds, but it would be a matter of agreement and would depend on the particular P&I Club. Arul said that he had never, whenever acting for defendants, given an open-ended bond or guarantee, for interest and costs. Godwin produced two examples in the early nineties of a guarantee where interest and costs were left open-ended. But Godwin accepted that those two instances must have been by agreement.
 49.Arul also said he has not known of any case where bail bond or guarantee was given on the principal claim plus interest and costs, and where the sums for interest and costs were not specified but subject only to an overall limit based on the value of the vessel.
 50.In the light of the evidence before me I hold that in early 1981 it was not the practice of admiralty solicitors to ask for open-ended guarantees or bail bonds even only for interest and costs. It was just not done. I will now deal with the question of the adequacy of the three aspects complained of - (i) costs; (ii) the period of three years; and (iii) interest rate of 8%.
 51.
 Costs 
 
Costs is most often a very difficult matter. Obviously the nature and complexity of the case are important factors. While the nature of a case may be easily gauged from the documents, or from facts related by clients, whether the trial would become protracted would depend very much on the issues raised by the defence. At the arrest/release stage, what would be the issues/defences that would be raised will often be far from clear. So the costs question must necessarily have to be approached on a broad basis and that would be the approach which the court would adopt. I would tend to agree with Arul that seeing clients at that stage may not be essential. It would be a matter for the solicitors to decide in each case.
 52.There is some evidence before me that in the early eighties $30,000 was often used as a standard for costs. But I do not think solicitors were obliged to accept that whatever may be the nature of the case or the amount involved. There should still be room for adjustment in the light of the particular circumstances of each case. A solicitor must exercise his judgment in each instance.
 53.However, one should not rely on the final outcome of the admiralty action (as Wiltopps have sought to do here) to argue what could reasonably be obtained as to costs at the relevant time. It is of interest to note that when the summons-for-directions was filed in respect of the admiralty action it was estimated that only five days would be required, with six witnesses. However, the learned Chief Justice granted only three days. The action came on for hearing in January 1985 and was adjourned for ten further days` hearing scheduled in August 1986. In the meantime, in February 1986 KDG applied for security for costs of the action against Wiltopps (being an entity resident out of Singapore) in the sum of S$200,000. That application came before the learned judge who had part-heard the case and he, knowing the full nature of the case, granted only S$60,000. Of course, if the trial could still not be completed within the 13 days and further days were required, it would not preclude KDG from asking for additional security. But it is significant to note that for the action that was to last 13 days` hearing in all, the learned judge in 1986 appeared to have felt that S$60,000 was reasonable security.
 54.I do not think it could be said, having regard to the above, that Emmanuel was negligent when in February 1981 he assessed costs at the rate of $30,000. At the time it would have been reasonable for Emmanuel to envisage that the trial would probably take three days, or at most five days, bearing in mind that the issues for trial were far from crystallized. To the extent that Mr Godwin said that the possibility of an appeal should also be borne in mind in determining costs, with respect, I do not share that view. I do not think the Registrar would have granted that. My reason is simply this. If Wiltopps should succeed at the trial they would be able to draw on the bail bond. If KDG should wish to appeal, besides the usual security for costs, Wiltopps could ask for additional security. On the other hand, if Wiltopps should fail in the action and wish to appeal, Wiltopps would have to furnish the usual security for costs (and perhaps even additional security) and there would be no basis to ask KDG to provide security.
 55.
 Interest period 
 
I turn next to the question of the period for which interest should be provided. On this point the evidence of Mr Godwin and Mr Arul was close. Godwin said M/s Emmanuel & Barker should have provided for five to six years, which included a period for appeal. Arul thought it should be three to four years and if there was an appeal, it would take another two years. In my opinion Wiltopps should only be entitled to ask for interest up to the trial and not for any appeal. No case has been cited to me to show that such a request was ever granted. My reason is the same as that for costs. If Wiltopps should succeed in the action they would be entitled to draw on the bail bond and there would be no question of further interest accruing. I do not see how it could be justified to the Registrar that he should grant security for interest to cover the period for an appeal in the event that Wiltopps should fail at the trial. The force of such an argument would at best be weak. It would be most extraordinary for that request to be met. Emmanuel had taken the lower of that range he mentioned of three-four years. It was a matter of judgment. I could not seriously say Emmanuel was negligent in this regard or had failed to exercise reasonable care. That was his honest assessment. Even before any security was offered by KDG, Emmanuel had mentioned on 18 February 1981 that it would take three years to reach trial.
 56.I note that the action was set down only on 25 May 1983, more than two years after the vessel was released. Even with this delay (not due to Emmanuel who ceased acting for Wiltopps in March 1981) in setting down the action for trial, it came up for hearing within 3 years and 11 months.
 57.
 Interest rate 
 
The final point is the rate of interest. Wiltopps` contention is that because the CA judgment had granted interest at 11% for the judgment sum in pound sterling, Emmanuel should have asked for 11% interest in relation to the security furnished. They submitted that as the claim in the admiralty action was in pound sterling and US dollars, a higher rate should have been obtained from KDG or the P&I Club; Emmanuel should have known that higher interest rate prevailed for foreign currencies.
 58.A number of arguments were advanced by counsel for Emmanuel & Barker on this aspect, one of which was that as the sum adjudged in favour of Wiltopps by the Court of Appeal was only 527,170.21 (excluding interest) and as the amount of security obtained under the bail bond amounted to 956,814.65 in all, the difference between those two sums would have covered even at interest of 11% of over seven years. While I can understand the argument, I have my doubts if it is valid since it seems to be based on ex post facto rationalization. I do not propose to go further into that.
 59.For my purpose I wish only to examine two other arguments of M/s Emmanuel & Barker. The first argument is that there is no evidence before this court as to the prevailing rates of interest for pound sterling and US dollars as at February 1981 or in the years before 1981. It is clear that Wiltopps must produce evidence to show that at the relevant time the rates for those currencies were, in fact, higher than 8%: Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd (No 2) [1976] 3 All ER 599 at 603. It does not follow just because the Court of Appeal on the evidence before it adopted an average of 11% for the years 1982 to 1992, that the rate prevailing in February 1981, or before that, must also be 11%. It is common knowledge that interest rates fluctuate from month to month or even daily. As no evidence was produced, Wiltopps have failed to prove this aspect of the claim.
 60.The second contention is that in determining whether Emmanuel was negligent one must bear in mind the entire circumstances prevailing at the time. As early as on 20 February 1981 when Hiratsuka was negotiating with KDG`s attorney, Hiratsuka informed Wiltopps and Emmanuel that he was endeavouring to make the guarantee, which the P&I Club intended to issue subject to Singapore jurisdiction, cover both components of the claim and he stated that `there seems to be no hope to increase the limit of guarantee and we consider it advisable to accept the amount ... taking into account the fact that the total of the mortgages on SM 9001 are in excess of Y800m whereas its value is said to be about Y700m.` At that point, KDG and the P&I Club were only prepared to offer security for the main claim of 670,000.
 61.That was why on 27 February 1981, Hiratsuka, who knew the financial position of KDG more clearly than any other person, and who had been negotiating with KDG/P&I Club and knew the extent they would go, gave an immediate response strongly urging Wiltopps to accept the undertaking and to instruct Emmanuel to release the tug. That must also have been the reason why a few minutes later (at 1030 hours) when Wiltopps asked the question `can P&I Club explain why 8% ... is taken in interest? Seems very low`, there was no response from either Hiratsuka or Emmanuel. It seems to me that Hiratsuka, who did the negotiations at his end, did not want to push it, lest the entire arrangement be jeopardised. It will be seen from the telex sent at 1040 hours that same day (quoted above) that Wiltopps knew that negotiations on substance was, in fact, carried out at Tokyo between Hiratsuka and KDG/P&I Club and their lawyers. Obviously Hiratsuka did not want to quibble over trivia. Having on many occasions spoken to Hiratsuka over the phone, Emmanuel would have been appraised of the delicate negotiations.
 62.Counsel for Wiltopps argued that if properly advised Wiltopps might have been willing to take a risk and reject the undertaking/bail bond. This cannot be true in the light of what Wiltopps stated in the 1040 hours telex wherein they asked KDG to refrain from suing Wiltopps for any delay in releasing the tug while Wiltopps were considering the matter.
 63.Finally, I would like to refer to Hiratsuka and Emmanuel`s answers when Wiltopps raised the interest point in a telex on 2 March 1981 addressed to Emmanuel and copied to Hiratsuka. It is necessary for me to quote in extenso their responses. In point of time, Hiratsuka gave the answer first: 
Under Japanese law, claimable interest rate is 5 pct in case of civil claim (or 6 pct in case of commercial claim) and accordingly 8 pct is higher than what you can claim under Japanese law. We understand that under Singapore law 8 pct is normal rate of interest which court allows.
 
 Pls note that our investigation has indicated that KDG is still in very difficult financial condition and all of their tugs are very heavily mortgaged
 (in most cases total of mortgages is more than the value of tug). Therefore if there is no P&I`s guarantee, situation is such that it is very difficult to recover even a part of the principal amount of your claim. Therefore we must say it is fortunate that we are offered a P&I Club`s guarantee to cover full claim amount plus interest and cost and 
 we feel it rather unrealistic to talk about percentage of interest
. Please trust that M/s Emmanuel and we have been doing our utmost to protect your interests and giving you such advices that we consider best.` [Emphasis added.]
 Emmanuel`s response came some two hours later as follows: 
1 Wiltopps is fortunate that any security at all has been furnished. If the tug remained under arrest and was sold by order of court Wiltopps would not obtain any money because mortgagees would take priority, and the tug is mortgaged in excess of her value. 
2 Wiltopps is also most fortunate that security for the whole amount of the claim has been furnished. In this respect all credit is due to M/s Hiratsuka & Partners for negotiating a tough deal with the Japan P+I Club. The rule in British admiralty law which is applicable in Singapore (and Hong Kong), is that the owners of a vessel under arrest need not furnish security in excess of the value of the vessel. KDG`s lawyers tell us that the value of the Sumi Maru 9001 is about Singapore dollars one million, security in Wiltopps favour for about 3.05m has been furnished. If we had been KDG`s lawyers we would certainly have insisted on security to a maximum of vessel`s value only be furnished. 
3 Interest of 8% per annum is the amount awarded by the Singapore court.
 In stating that the Singapore courts awarded interest at 8%, Emmanuel obviously meant that that was the usual rate as was alluded to by Hiratsuka.
 64.It must also be borne in mind that Emmanuel was then dealing with a solicitor at M/s Drew & Napier who was well versed in admiralty matters. It is, therefore, against all that background that we ought to view Emmanuel`s decision not to quibble anymore on the matters of interest rate, the period or the question of costs, when as a whole what was offered was clearly reasonable. I think it is wholly unrealistic for Wiltopps` counsel to submit before me that as the gross value of the tug was US$4m, Emmanuel could have asked for more, without taking into account the fact that it was heavily mortgaged. This fact of the tug being heavily mortgaged was stated in Hiratsuka`s telex of 20 February 1981. Emmanuel did not act purely on the assertion of KDG`s Singapore solicitors. If the vessel were not released and if it were to be sold, then as pointed out by Emmanuel, Wiltopps would have been very much worse off. As I see it both Hiratsuka and Emmanuel have, in the circumstances, in exercise of their best judgment, did not think it prudent to pursue the interest point raised by Wiltopps in their telex of 27 February 1981, lest the greater interest of Wiltopps might be jeopardised, and, if that had occurred, more likely than not, Wiltopps would have blamed their solicitors even more.
 65.
 Judgment 
 
In the result, Wiltopps` claim is dismissed with costs. However, as M/s Emmanuel & Barker have failed in the defence of limitation, they should not be entitled to costs for getting-up in relation to that.
 66.Much that I appreciate the losses suffered by Wiltopps on account of the fact that they could not recover the full sum due under the CA judgment, I do not think they should find fault with their solicitors, both Emmanuel and Hiratsuka, when their solicitors were clearly trying, in a difficult and delicate situation, to get the maximum advantage for Wiltopps without quibbling over what were essentially marginal matters. The continued arrest of SM 9001 would have left Wiltopps in a poorer state than the terms set out in the guarantee offered by the P&I Club which were later incorporated in the bail bond.",1998-07-02 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This was a consolidated appeal arising out of the trial judge`s decision in the court below. In the trial below, after a hearing lasting two weeks, the trial judge convicted the three accused on two charges of criminal conspiracy to fix the results of two S-League soccer matches. The third accused appealed against his conviction in MA 237/97/05. Conversely, the Public Prosecutor, by MA Nos 237/97/02-04, appealed against the sentences imposed upon all three accused by the trial judge. Before the appeal proper commenced, the first accused withdrew his appeal against conviction. I heard the third accused`s appeal against conviction before hearing the Public Prosecutor on the appeal against sentence for the three accused.
 2.At the conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed the third accused`s appeal against conviction, and enhanced the sentences imposed upon him to include an imprisonment term of two months on each of his convictions, both to run consecutively. In addition, I allowed the Public Prosecutor`s appeal against the sentence imposed on the first accused and enhanced the sentence to one of 12 months` imprisonment for the first charge and six months` imprisonment for the second charge, both to run consecutively, making it a total of 18 months` imprisonment. I however dismissed the Public Prosecutor`s appeal against the sentence imposed on the second accused. I now give my reasons.
 3.
 The three accused
The first accused, Rajendran s/o Kurusamy, widely known as `Pal` within the soccer circle, was and is at all material times a businessman by profession. He gave evidence that he did work on board ships, in labour supply, tank cleaning and maintenance. It was common knowledge that he used to be involved heavily in football bettings and was a bookie for a period of time previously. In a previous case before this court, he was a prosecution witness testifying against some corrupt footballers in Singapore (see 
Kannan s/o Kunjiraman v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 757
 ). The second accused, Ramadas s/o Eurulandi Sangelee, was the first accused`s good friend and employee. During the time when the first accused was a bookie, the second accused was one of his runners. When the first accused ceased to be a bookie, the second accused became a runner for other bookies. As for the third accused, Devaraj s/o Doraisamy, he was a professional footballer, and the captain of his club, Woodlands Wellington, during the 1996 season for the S-League competition. After the season ended, he joined Jurong Football Club. At the commencement of the trial in the court below, he was unemployed.
 4.
 The charges
For ease of convenience, the third accused will be referred to as B3. The first and second accused will be referred to as B1 and B2 respectively.
 5.B1, B2 and B3 were charged in two amalgamated charges collectively for trying to fix the results of two football matches arising out of the S-League football competition in Singapore, the local football league. Under the first charge, it was alleged that B1 on 8 May 1996 asked one Maran s/o Jagannathan (Maran), a footballer with Woodlands Wellington to arrange with his team-mates to ensure that Woodlands Wellington Football Club would not win its match against Sembawang Rangers Football Club, another football club within the S-League. It was alleged that Maran subsequently informed B3 about this arrangement. Consequently, Woodlands Wellington lost to Sembawang Rangers by three goals to one. Maran thereafter received S$38,000 from B2 through Gomes Jerome Raymund (Gomes). Gomes was a personal friend of Maran. Maran then gave S$3,000 to Gomes, $10,000 to B3 and kept the rest for himself.
 6.As for the second charge, it was alleged that before Woodlands Wellington played Balestier Central United Football Club, another football club within the S-League, on 6 August 1996, B1 contacted Maran to ensure that Woodlands Wellington would lose the match to Balestier Central United by at least two clear goals. It was alleged that B1 offered Maran S$120,000 should the desired result be achieved. However, later that same day, B2 contacted Maran and said that B1 could only pay him S$60,000 because insufficient bets had been collected. Subsequently, B1 contacted Maran again and further reduced the amount to S$40,000. Maran rejected the deal. Shortly before the game started, Maran received a pager call with the number `80000`. Maran took the pager call to mean that he would be paid S$80,000 to fix the match. He thereafter approached B3 who agreed to help him. Consequently, Woodlands Wellington lost the match by five goals to one. For reasons which will be set out later, Maran was paid only S$3,000, and he gave Gomes and B3 S$250 and S$1,400 each respectively.
 7.
 Facts
The facts of the present appeal were exhaustively set out by the trial judge in the court below. However, it was useful to replicate the facts relevant to the appeal. It was also pertinent to note that in the court below, two voir dires were conducted in relation to two statements which the prosecution sought to adduce as evidence during the trial. The first was a statement from B2, and before the commencement of the trial, he alleged that this statement was made involuntarily.
 a The first voir dire
 8.The prosecution`s evidence in this respect was simple. On 11 March 1997, when B2 was brought in for questioning by CPIB officers in relation to the two charges, he was very stubborn and refused to talk. This lasted for the ensuing two days. However, on 13 March 1997 at 3.29am in the morning, B2 finally relented and his statement was recorded. This recording took place at senior special investigator Osman Ahamed`s room (Osman) in the following manner. Both Osman and B2 spoke to each other in Tamil. The answers were recorded in English by Osman on his computer. Thereafter, Osman read the statement back to B2 and explained the contents to him in Tamil. B2 agreed to what was contained in the statement. In addition, Osman also testified that he told B2 that he was bound to answer the questions put to him under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed).
 9.In brief, B2`s statement stated that he had on numerous occasions spoken to Maran over the telephone about match-fixing. On numerous occasions also, he was with B1 when B1 discussed match-fixing with Maran. Although he could not remember the details, he recalled that sometime in May 1996, B1 spoke to Maran and agreed to give him money, if Maran could help rig the result of a match in the S-League. A day or two later, B2 was in B1`s flat when Maran telephoned and asked B1 to hand over the money. B1 thereupon asked B2 to hand over $33,000 in cheque and $5,000 in cash to Maran. Maran also said he would ask a friend to collect the money on his behalf, and it was later established that this man was Gomes. Sometime in August 1996, a similar situation occurred and B1 called Maran to ask if he could rig a match in return for $120,000. However, later that same day, B2 had to call Maran to tell him that B1 could only give him $60,000 due to the insufficiency of bets collected. It was only later that he was told by B1 that the deal concerning the $120,000 had not materialised.
 10.When asked by B2`s counsel in the proceedings below as to why B2 would finally relent into giving a statement sometime in the early hours of 13 March 1997, which was close to the end of the 48-hour holding period for a suspect, Osman said that, by that time, they had gathered enough evidence of B2`s involvement in the match-fixing allegations and so B2 decided to `come clean`. He also maintained at all times that B2 gave the statement voluntarily without any inducement, threat or promise.
 11.B2 painted a different picture altogether of the circumstances leading to the obtaining of his statement. His evidence was that he had given a different statement and he disputed that the statement produced before the trial judge was the one which was recorded. He called B1 to testify on his behalf. On 11 March 1997, after he was brought to the CPIB, he said Osman showed him a form and asked if he admitted to it. He also claimed Osman told him that the real target of the investigations was B1 and therefore if he admitted to what he was shown, he would only be a witness. However, since he did not do any of the matters which were alleged, he did not admit to anything.
 12.On 12 March 1997, Osman interviewed him again. Again, he refused to admit to anything, since he felt that he had not done anything wrong. He also stated that Osman told him that the Chinese CPIB officers were afraid of him, therefore Osman, being an Indian was interviewing him. In addition, he claimed that, while he was kept in detention, he could hardly get any rest as various CPIB officers around were making a lot of noise by going into the room one after another and kicking the room door deliberately to keep him awake. Further, he felt very cold inside the interview room as the air-con was tuned to its coldest level. However, he had no idea how to change the temperature, and thus endured the cold.
 13.In the early hours of 13 March 1997, another CPIB officer, special investigator Sathiabalan s/o MV (Sathia) brought him for a smoke in the toilet. There he met B1. A short while later, Osman joined them and they started discussing the match-fixing allegations forming the essence of the two charges. Osman and Sathia collectively advised B2 to admitted to paying $33,000 in cheque and $5,000 in cash as a bookmaker (another term for `bookie`). This was supported by B1, who advised him to tell the truth. Swayed by B1`s persuasion, B2 decided to tell the truth. Consequently, he told his side of the story and gave Osman a statement in which he admitted to being a bookie who had lost a large bet amounting to $38,000 to Maran and, because he did not have money to repay him, had to borrow from B1. B1 lent him $33,000 while he came up with $5,000 cash himself to pay Maran. He denied the statement which was recorded by Osman and put as evidence in the court below.
 14.B2 also admitted that after his statement was taken, although Osman only read out the amounts of $33,000 and $5,000 back to him, B2 did not insist on the whole statement being read back to him because he trusted Osman. He trusted Osman even though, as the prosecution pointed out, it was the first time he had met him. He assumed the rest of the statement totalling five pages in all related to his school, marriage and other background matters. Although he did notice the amounts of $50,000, $60,000 and $120,000 contained within the statement, he did not make a fuss about them as he was told that this did not concern him.
 15.When B1 testified, he confirmed what B2 had said about meeting him at the toilet at CPIB. He stated that he had known B2 for a long time and had often lent money to him. In May 1996, B2 called him and told him that he had lost in gambling, hence he needed to borrow some money from B1 to pay Maran. B1 also said B2 asked for a loan which he had requested previously to set up a flower shop. B1 therefore approached a male Chinese who owed him some money in respect of a business transaction. Consequently, the male Chinese paid B1 $33,000 in cheque and B2 collected the cheque from the male Chinese.
 16.After a through consideration of the evidence, the trial judge accepted that the statement recorded by Osman and tendered by the prosecution was the genuine and correct one. He rejected B2`s assertion that there was any inducement, threat or promise in obtaining that statement. In his view, and in my opinion rightly so, the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that B2`s statement had been properly recorded and that it was a voluntary one. In particular, it was noted that since B2`s challenge against the admission of his statement was that it did not reflect what he had told Osman, therefore there was no need to examine whether he had been pressurised into making the statement by the alleged cold room treatment, the continuous stream of officers going in and out of the room or by the alleged kickings of the door, all of which prevented him from getting some sleep. Also, the trial judge made the observation that the toilet rendezvous did not take place, or even if it did, any inducement which came about came from B1, who advised B2 to tell the truth, and not from the CPIB officers. Hence, the statement, save for the irrelevant portions which were excluded by the mutual consent of both the prosecution and defence, was purely voluntary and was admitted as evidence.
 17.During the appeal, no challenge was made by B3 on the admissibility of this statement.
 b The second voir dire
 18.The more relevant statement, however, came from Maran, and counsel for B3 criticised its admission vigorously during the appeal.
 19.Shortly after the commencement of the trial, a second voir dire was conducted, and this time it related to Maran`s statements which he gave to CPIB officers when he was called in for questioning by them on the match-fixing allegations. Maran was not charged with any offence but was the key prosecution witness. In essence, Maran`s statements formed the platform of the prosecution`s case. However, after the commencement of the trial, Maran tried to retract from the statements when he was put on the stand by the prosecution.
 20.Insofar as his background was concerned, Maran, like B3, was also a footballer. When he was called by the prosecution to testify, he became hostile and gave evidence which took the prosecution by surprise. Explaining the money which he received from B1 and B2, he said it was a result of winning bets with them. In particular, on 8 May 1996, he placed bets totalling $38,000 with B2 and won. He went to B2`s flat that same night and obtained his winnings which were given to him in as $33,000 in cheque and $5,000 in cash. He was accompanied by Gomes, who helped collect the money from B2. Gomes was subsequently given $3,000 for helping him. In addition, Gomes deposited the $33,000 cheque into his own personal account and once the cheque was cleared, he (meaning Maran) would take a few thousand dollars each time until he had taken back all the money. He explained that he used Gomes as a cover because he was a footballer and did not want anyone to know that he was involved in betting in football. Gomes was the ideal cover-up for him.
 21.A month later, in June 1996, when the European football championship matches began, he again betted, but this time he was not so lucky and lost heavily. He therefore owed a number of people money, including B3.
 22.Woodlands Wellington played and lost to Sembawang on 8 May 1996. Maran played in that match. He maintained that he did not speak to anyone. After the Woodlands team lost, every player felt very disappointed, including himself and B3.
 23.Where the game against Balestier Central United on 6 August 1996 was concerned, Maran admitted receiving a page with the number `80000` but had no idea what it meant. At about that time, he also went, again with Gomes, to B1`s flat to collect a cheque from B1. He claimed he wanted a loan of $20,000 from B1 but B1 could only lend him $8,000 as he (meaning B1) was `very tight`. Subsequently, the cheque was dishonoured after Gomes tried to bank it into his account. B1 thereafter handed over $3,000 in cash to him instead, from which he gave Gomes $250 to $300. He also used about $1,000 to repay a loan which he had taken from B3.
 24.The prosecution therefore applied to impeach Maran under s 157 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) as he was obviously hostile to their case, and his evidence did not coincide with that in the statements which he gave to the CPIB. Thereafter, they sought to admit his statements under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act, whereupon Maran disputed the voluntariness of these statements. This formed the background to the second voir dire which the trial judge conducted.
 25.In contrast to B2`s statement, the evidence surrounding the admissibility of Maran`s statements was not so straightforward. He gave his evidence first. He testified that in the early hours of 11 March 1997, he was asked to follow two CPIB officers to help clarify certain matters about match-fixing. His name had been implicated, and the CPIB officers required an explanation from him. These two officers, namely senior special investigator Chin Wee Lian (Chin) and senior special investigator Raymond Wee (Raymond Wee) also searched his house pursuant to a search warrant and took away some documents, including his passport. When Maran arrived at CPIB, he was led into a room whereupon Sathia appeared and asked why Maran had gotten into trouble again. Maran had been investigated by the CPIB in 1994 and had admitted to Sathia then that he was involved in football bettings.
 26.According to Maran, Sathia then told him not to worry as the only person the CPIB was after was B1. Maran was given the impression that, since the Abbas Saad trial when B1 managed to get left the hook, the CPIB came under tremendous pressure from the Attorney-General`s Chambers to prosecute B1. Hence, he asked Maran for his co-operation.
 27.A while later, several other CPIB officers, including Chin, met Maran and told him to co-operate. They passed out the idea that only B1 would be nailed, and no one else would be prosecuted. Maran was also led to several other rooms where several players from other local football clubs were present and Sathia told him that they more or less had enough evidence to prosecute B1.
 28.Thereafter, when he was left alone, he began to think about what he should tell the CPIB. This culminated in the various statements which he made subsequently. The first statement, made sometime in the afternoon of 11 March 1997, essentially stated that he was only involved in betting on the outcome of football matches. He had betted with B1 before, and had won and lost on different occasions. In addition, he had also borrowed money from B1. When B1 approached him to ask him to help rig the results of the two football matches, which formed the subject of the charge against the three accused, he refused.
 29.The second statement was given at 9.15am the next day and it was to clarify some things which were recorded earlier. Maran elaborated the match-fixing incident in relation to the match against Balestier Central United on 6 August 1997. He said that, on that fateful day, B1 called him with the offer of $120,000 for his effort to help arrange that Woodlands Wellington-Balestier Central match. Subsequently, B2 also called and reduced the amount to $60,000. On either occasion, he did not expressly agree to help B1.
 30.A further statement was then recorded on the same day at 12.30pm. Maran stated that this statement came about because he was under tremendous pressure from the CPIB officers to give them what they wanted. In short, this statement, forming the pillar of the prosecution`s case, elaborated the events which took place leading to the match-fixing allegations. It also retracted the previous two statements which he gave earlier in which he denied being involved in any match-fixing. In the statement, Maran claimed that B1 approached him to fix the results of two football matches and he agreed.
 31.While there was no dispute that a statement was indeed taken from Maran, he insisted that it was given as a result of the pressure put on him since he arrived at the CPIB. From 11 March 1997 when he was brought to CPIB till 12 March 1997, he could not get any sleep as various CPIB officers kept him awake by asking the same questions over and over again about the match-fixing allegations. He confessed that the breaking point came when Gomes was brought into the room to meet him and he felt very bad for having implicated Gomes. He said that Gomes` only role was to collect money for him and that so long as Gomes was allowed to return home to his `sick and aged mother`, he would confess all. During this time, Maran claimed Gomes was almost in tears and he himself was physically and mentally drained from all the questionings by the CPIB officers.
 32.When this statement was initially taken, Maran maintained that he did not know anything about match-fixing. This led Chin to become very angry. Maran therefore claimed he had no choice but to fabricate a story as words were put into his mouth.
 33.At first, he claimed he was the only player involved in the match-fixing allegations. Chin did not believe him. In fact, Chin insisted he must have spoken to, amongst others, B3 who was his childhood friend and had even played professional football with him. Chin told him that he would have to name others. It was repeated that the CPIB were only interested in prosecuting B1, and all the other football players whom he had met were giving evidence against B1. He was assured that, even if it was mentioned that B3 was involved in match-fixing, he (meaning B3) would not be charged. Maran therefore implicated B3 in the match-fixing allegations. He also mentioned one Sandro Radun (Radun), another footballer. Both, he claimed, were involved in match-fixing with B1.
 34.Soon after this statement was taken, Chin told Maran that his superiors were happy at the statement. Maran then gave, in my mind, a rather incredible story that various CPIB officers came into the room and congratulated him, treating him as if he was a `long lost friend` and even shook hands with him for co-operating with them.
 35.At about 11pm on 12 March 1997, after Maran had been kept in custody for more than one and a half days, Chin came into the room and told him that, while all the other footballers had admitted to having been involved in match-fixing, B3 still maintained his innocence. Chin therefore asked Maran to persuade B3 to admit to match-rigging, otherwise B3 would be charged on the basis of Maran`s statements, in particular his latest one. Maran agreed.
 36.When Maran met B3, Chin and Sathia were all in the same room. Subsequently, Chin left but Sathia remained. Maran told B3 that he felt very bad for implicating him and apologised but maintained that he had no choice. B3 in reply asked Maran why he had been implicated, as he was clearly innocent of any wrongdoing. At this juncture, Maran claimed Sathia interrupted and told B3 that, if he was not involved in any match-fixing allegations, he should not admit it. Sathia also advised B3 to just sign and not correct any error in any statement given to the CPIB and make a police report after he was released from CPIB.
 37.Chin then returned, and upon learning that Maran could not persuade B3 to admit, abused B3. Maran left the room. He admitted feeling very guilty having spilled the beans on B3.
 38.A couple of hours later, another CPIB officer approached Maran. This time, it was to persuade Maran to convince Radun to own up to the match-fixing allegations. Again, Maran agreed. At the trial below, no evidence was given as to whether Radun did in fact own up to the match-fixing allegations or at all.
 39.The final incident, according to Maran, came at about 2 to 3am in the morning of 13 March 1996. Sathia came into the room where he was kept and showed him a set of handcuffs, which he said was meant for B1. At this juncture, Maran said he asked if he could get any written assurance that the CPIB would not do anything to him. Sathia replied that he could not do that, but would speak to his superiors about it. At about 7.30am that same morning, Maran was released from the CPIB.
 40.Prior to his release, at about 1am that same morning, Maran made a short statement wherein he clarified certain matters pertaining to the previous statements which were given. During the trial below, while he disputed several paragraphs in the statement, he could not elaborate on how the statement came about to be recorded, save that it was made and was factually inaccurate.
 41.After he was released from the CPIB, he consulted his lawyer. The advice given was that he must speak the truth. On or about the same time, Chin recalled him to the CPIB. He thus went back determined to tell them that he had lied in his statements about the events surrounding the match-fixing incidents.
 42.But back at the CPIB, when he attempted to resile on his previous statements, Chin became very angry and threatened to charge him. According to Maran, Chin consequently went to speak to his superiors about his changing the statements. When he returned, he told Maran that it was impossible to change them. However, he did allow Radun`s name to be deleted, but insisted B3`s name must stay in the statements, although assurances were given that B3 would not be charged. The purpose of implicating B3 but not charging him was to ensure that B1`s match-fixing activities were believable. Maran protested that two players, B3 and himself, could hardly make a difference to the performance of the whole team but Chin merely grinned and dismissed those protests.
 43.On 7 June 1997, Maran was called to the CPIB again. Then, he learnt that B3 was charged with match-fixing. He felt very angry and cheated, as he had been assured that no such thing would happen. Throughout the whole duration of the voir dire, and in fact throughout the trial as well, Maran insisted that he was a victim of the CPIB`s tactics to force him to tell lies. The whole episode, in his words, had etched a scar in his memory and he was still haunted by memories of the days which he spent at the CPIB.
 44.The prosecution then gave their version of the evidence during the second voir dire, which was led by Chin, the principal CPIB officer responsible for taking Maran`s statement. Chin testified that, after Maran was brought to the CPIB, he was questioned about his involvement with B1 and other related matters. The first statement was recorded sometime in the afternoon of 1 March 1997. After it was recorded, Maran had the opportunity to read through it and make any corrections which he wanted.
 45.Throughout his custody at the CPIB, whatever he wanted the officers would try their best to accommodate him. He was also allowed to make telephone calls to his wife at home. On 12 March 1997, another statement was recorded in the morning. During the recording, at 9.20am, it was recorded that Maran asked to telephone home and was permitted to do so. At the end of the recording, as usual, he was allowed to read through it and make any amendments as he wished.
 46.After Maran was brought in for questioning, Chin and senior special investigator Ang Seow Lian (Ang) requested Gomes to help in their investigations. Gomes was brought to Yishun to identify the place where he collected some money from B2 on behalf of Maran. He was also asked about the $33,000 which he banked into his account for Maran, and his account books were taken.
 47.After Gomes admitted to helping Maran, Chin asked Maran to account for the $33,000 and, according to Chin, that was when Maran realised he was caught. Thereafter, realising that he could lie no further, Maran admitted to match-fixing with B3 and Radun. This was the third statement which concluded at 4.15pm when it was recorded. As for the fourth statement, it was made in the early hours of 13 March 1997 at 1am. Again, Maran read through the statement after it was recorded and was satisfied that everything contained therein was correct. In total, Maran made four statements while he was kept in custody at the CPIB.
 48.Chin maintained that there was never any inducement, threat or promise to make these statements. In fact, every effort had been made to ensure that the statements and the circumstances surrounding their recording accorded to the law. Maran was treated properly without anything untoward being said or done against him. He denied any allegations of improper behaviour towards Maran or anyone else. When Maran was called up again on 14 March 1997, he (meaning Maran) similarly did not make any fuss as to the statements which he made. He also made a further statement, his fifth and final statement, to clarify several matters.
 49.Insofar as the meeting between Maran and B3 was concerned, Chin said it took place at around 2am on 13 March 1997 in the following manner. Maran broke down and cried, lamenting that he had `spoilt` his life. He asked Chin whether B3 had confirmed what he said and told him that he was feeling very bad that he had told the truth and got his friends implicated while B3, a `brother` to him, had not spilled the beans. He did not know how he was going to face B3 and asked to be allowed to speak to B3 and to apologise to him. He also wanted to tell B3 to tell the truth. Chin then asked Maran to tell B3 to `come clean`. He also asked Sathia to bring Maran to where B3 was kept because he was afraid that Maran and B3 would converse in Tamil. Maran then apologised to B3 who was angry with him for what was said. Maran was told that, if he alone was involved in match-fixing, he should admit it but not implicate others. At no time did Sathia ask B3 to report any impropriety of the CPIB to the police.
 50.Sathia then took the stand and his evidence materially corroborated Chin`s testimony. On 14 March 1997, Maran had paged him asking him about the progress of the case and Sathia replied that the investigations were still in progress. He explained that Maran obtained his pager number on 12 March 1997 when he spoke to Maran. Maran had indicated that he wanted to speak to Sathia and, when Sathia saw him, he was almost in tears. Sathia therefore gave Maran his pager number and told him to contact him if he had any problems.
 51.On one or two other occasions, Maran did page Sathia again and when Sathia returned the call, he always advised Maran to wait until the matter came to court. He disputed defence counsel`s allegations that he told B3 to report the CPIB to the police, or that he told Maran they were under pressure from the Attorney-General`s chambers to charge B1. He further denied that he had brought handcuffs for Maran to see and told him that they were meant for B1, or that B1`s bail was to be set at $2m. Nor did he say that after Maran left the CPIB, he told him that none of the footballers would be charged.
 52.The prosecution also called Ang to testify. Ang was the officer assigned to interview Gomes. When he brought Gomes to identify Maran sometime in the morning of 11 March 1997, Maran was alone. Nothing was said between them, and he did not have any contact with Maran. On 12 March 1997, Gomes met Maran again, but this time Ang wanted to pass Gomes`s bank account book to Chin, who was interviewing Maran. Again, nothing was said between Gomes and Maran. Apart from bringing food and drinks to Maran, Ang did not have any other contact with Maran. Ang also met Gomes`s mother once in the morning of 11 March 1997 and she appeared to be in good health.
 53.There was also senior special investigator Low Thiap Cher (Low) and she recorded a statement from Maran on 7 June 1997 when Maran reported back to the CPIB at their request. Maran said nothing material to change the previous statements which he had given to Chin. He did ask however for his passport back but this request was rejected as Low had instructions to retain his passport. Although Maran had been asking previously for the return of his passport, Low always refused to give it back.
 54.The prosecution also called three other CPIB officers to testify but their evidence was not really material to the issue in the voir dire. Maran was then recalled to the witnesses stand and cross-examined by the prosecution but he maintained what he had said orally during the voir dire and refuted allegations that he was making all these up now and that his previous statements were really the truth regarding what had taken place in relation to the match-fixing allegations.
 55.The trial judge accepted that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Maran`s statement made at the CPIB had been given voluntarily. He noted that Maran was not physically assaulted, nor was he threatened with violence. Further, Maran`s complaints that he was not given proper food nor allowed to sleep could not be so serious as to have sapped his will that he succumbed to the pressure of the CPIB officers. It would be stretching the concept of voluntariness too far if the recording authority had to re-create an environment which the witness was comfortable and familiar with before the statements were admissible in law.
 56.As for the incident that Sathia advised B3 and Maran to report any impropriety on the part of the CPIB officers to the police, it was not accepted by the trial judge. He felt that it was inconceivable that Sathia would betray his own colleagues or department in this respect. The same reasoning was applied when Sathia allegedly told Maran and B3 not to correct any mistakes which appeared in their statements. In any event, Maran did not heed Sathia`s `advice` because, although he did not report any matters to the police, he continued to amend his statements right up to the commencement of the trial.
 57.The trial judge also felt there was also no reason why Maran should be so concerned about the health and welfare of Gomes`s mother, who appeared to be in good health, contrary to what Maran had insisted. More significantly, Maran did not state that Gomes told him that his mother was sick and ill. It was therefore highly unlikely that Maran knew about Gomes`s mother`s state of health, not having been told about it. All Gomes did was to simply shake his head, and this could not have indicated to Gomes that his mother was in need of serious care. The defence did invite the trial judge to draw an adverse inference on the failure of the prosecution to call Gomes to testify, but the trial judge refused on the basis that it was equally open to Maran to call Gomes to back up his story.
 58.Finally, the trial judge found that there was no inducement or threat by the CPIB officers to force Maran to make the statements which he made. There was equally no such promise that only B1 would be charged and the football players and Maran himself would be spared. This was the reason why Maran was so concerned about getting immunity from the prosecution, to the extent that he requested in writing such immunity. He was afraid that he would be prosecuted but no threats to do so and no promise of immunity, whether for him or for the other players, was made by the officers.
 c The trial proper
 59.Returning back to the trial proper, apart from Maran`s statements and B2`s statement which the prosecution relied on, they also tendered five conditioned statements under s 371 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). These conditioned statements, together with Maran and B2`s respective statements, formed the background and overall picture of the prosecution`s case. Conditioned Statement 1 was from one Toh Gim Hin (Toh), and it elaborated on the events whereby he received a call from B1 asking for the return of some money which he owed to B1. Toh thereafter prepared and had a cheque of $33,000 ready for collection by B1. B1 subsequently asked B2 to collect the money for him and this was duly done at a coffee shop somewhere in Ang Mo Kio. All this while, Toh had no idea what the money was used for, although he admitted B1 did tell him that it was B2 who needed the money for some business, but he disbelieved him on that point. He was under the impression that B1 was simply using B2 as an excuse to chase him for the money which he owed.
 60.Conditioned Statement 2 was made by Ong Poh Kok (Ong) and Ong described how Toh had approached him for money whereupon he asked his wife to issue a cheque of $33,000 to Toh. This was a Keppel Bank cheque No 651558 which was subsequently given to Toh, who in turn passed it to B2. Ong also admitted that he had lied to his wife that Toh would give $33,000 in cash in return for the cheque, when in actual fact, the $33,000 in cash came from Ong himself.
 61.Ong`s wife, Julie Poh, confirmed that she issued a blank cheque of $33,000 for Toh. This was Conditioned Statement No 3. She was under the impression that the cheque was in return for $33,000 cash which Toh allegedly passed to Ong.
 62.Conditioned Statement 4 came from Jayabalan Subramaniam (Jayabalan), and it was to the effect that he was asked by B1 to hand some money to Gomes sometime in August or September 1996. He also saw another Indian with Gomes but did not identify him. He had no knowledge as to how much money he handed to Gomes.
 63.Conditioned Statement 5 listed the players who played in the two matches allegedly fixed by B1. In both these matches, B3 and Maran were listed as players. This statement was given by the team manager of Woodlands Wellington, Vengadasalam s/o Rengayyan, and he also stated that all players were told not to be involved in any football corruption or to accept any money other than from the club whom they belonged to and represented.
 64.Finally, there was Conditioned Statement 6, and it came from Gomes. This statement established that he had on two occasions, in April or May 1996 and August or September 1996, followed Maran to collect some money which Maran claimed he had won from football matches. Consequently, he was given some money for his assistance. On the first occasion when he collected the $33,000 cheque for Maran, he banked it into his account and returned portions of the money to Maran as and when he was asked to. On the second occasion sometime in August 1996, it was a cheque which he first collected from B1 with Maran. He had met B1 with Maran and B1 had handed over a cheque to Maran who passed it to him to bank it in. Unfortunately, the cheque bounced and so, sometime later, he went with Maran again to B1`s house at Block 61 Yishun Street 61 to collect the money. This time he received $3,000 in cash from Jayabalan. Maran then gave him $250 for his help.
 65.The prosecution`s case as a whole was that B1 on two occasions bribed Maran successfully to lose the two matches which he played in. Maran sought help from B3, and in return both B3 and Maran received money from B1. It was not clear whether B1 knew that B3 was also involved in helping him fix the results of the matches, as this was not expressly mentioned by Maran. However, Maran`s statements were clear that, regardless of whether B1 knew whether B3 was involved or not, once the desired result in each football match was achieved, B1 would pay Maran who would in turn pay a portion of what he received to B3.
 66.After Maran`s statements were admitted as evidence, the prosecution then cross-examined him on their contents and his earlier oral testimony during the second voir dire before applying to impeach his credit. Maran stood firm that what he stated in his statements was false. The evidence which he had given orally was the correct one. He also maintained that he knew banking a cheque would allow that cheque to be traced, hence if he was involved in match-fixing, he would have insisted that he be paid in cash, and not by cheque. The very fact that he was paid by cheque showed that he was not involved in any sort of illegal activities.
 67.Maran agreed that B3 was never involved in any match-fixing acts, and had never approached him to fix any matches. In the two matches which he played which now formed the centre of the match-fixing allegations, B3 was the captain of the team and had played very well, drawing praise from the coach and assistant coach of Woodlands Wellington on his performance.
 68.
 Close of prosecution`s case
Counsel for B1 and B2 chose not to make any submissions at this stage, associating himself nevertheless with the submissions of B3. Counsel for B3 argued that the only substantive evidence against B3 came in the form of Maran`s statements which he made to the CPIB. However, those statements were wrongly used against Maran under s 147 of the Evidence Act, as that was a provision which contemplated that statements be used to contradict a witness only during 
 cross-examination 
. In the present case, Maran was a prosecution witness, and his statements which he made to the CPIB and which were subsequently admitted came about in his 
 examination-in-chief 
. Reference was then made to 
 State v Mohan Hira 
 AIR 1960 Guj 9. The only available option therefore was impeachment of credit under s 157 of the Evidence Act. In addition, even if Maran`s statements were admissible by virtue of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act, they were so manifestly unreliable that no reasonable tribunal could safely convict on them.
 69.The prosecution in contrast argued that they had fulfilled their legal obligations which showed that B1, B2 and B3 were involved in a conspiracy to fix a match, which was an `illegal` act following this court`s ruling in 
Kannan s/o Kunjiraman v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 757
 . The test to apply at this stage was that propounded in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  [1980-1981] SLR 73 , which required no further repeating. Further, where Maran`s statements were concerned, the process of impeachment by cross-examination under ss 156 and 157 of the Evidence Act and then admitting the previous inconsistent statements for the truth of the matters in issue were precisely what happened in 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
  and hence the defence`s contentions borne no merit.
 70.Having reviewed both prosecution and defence submissions and considered the prosecution`s evidence under the tests propounded in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 and 
Ng Theng Shuang v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 36
 , the trial judge came to the conclusion that there was a prima facie case established by the prosecution which warranted calling the defence of B1, B2 and B3. He held (at [para ] 325): 
I am in complete agreement with the prosecution`s submissions. The totality of the prosecution`s evidence clearly established a prima facie case against all three accused on both the charges before me. B2`s statement implicated both him and B1 in the offences in question. Maran`s statements have been found to be voluntary and have been admitted to contradict practically the entirety of his testimony in court. Despite the fact that there was a dramatic 
 volte-face
, we have in hand a comprehensive account by Maran of the events that culminated in the alleged offences. Maran has of course disavowed the statements as a pack of lies which he was forced to spew forth but the prosecution has succeeded in establishing that there was no coercion of any sort exerted on him.
 71.He concluded (at [para ] 328): 
I shall not descend into a maximum evaluation of the prosecution`s evidence at this stage because the 
 Haw Tua Tau
 test required only a minimum evaluation of the evidence at the close of the prosecution`s case (
 Theng Shuang v PP
). Looking at the evidence in its totality thus far, I found it not inherently incredible and would, if unrebutted, warrant the conviction of all three accused persons on both charges. I therefore called on each of them to enter upon their defence.
 72.
 B1`s defence
B1`s defence did not differ much from that which he gave at the first voir dire. He denied any intention to fix the results of any football match, nor did he have any discussions with Maran, B2 and B3 about the same.
 73.He admitted that he used to be involved in football bettings and these amounts were huge amounts. Within five months in 1994 alone, he had amassed over $20m from his bookmaking activities. He had a reputation of being the king of bookies then, and more than 100 bookmakers `threw` the bets which they had collected with him. However, around this time, he also lost much on the many business ventures which he undertook, and hence he often encountered cash-flow problems.
 74.Unfortunately, the law caught up with him and after he became a prosecution witness in other trials (see 
 Kannan s/o Kunjiraman v PP 
), he retired from this lucrative but illegal business and turned instead to concentrate on his business activities. Even though there were times when people approached him to place bets, he turned them down.
 75.As to the cheque of $33,000 which he handed to B2, the latter told him that he had lost heavily to Maran and needed some money to repay the loss. As a result, B1 went out of his way to get $33,000 for B2. The other $5,000 which made up a total of $38,000 subsequently given to Maran was B2`s own, and B1 denied any knowledge about it. In any event, B1 claimed that in his experience, when a football team was bribed to lose matches, at least seven players must be involved. It was impossible to do so with less, not to mention only two players.
 76.There was then the money which he gave to Maran sometime in August or September 1996 and B1 explained that Maran needed some money for some renovation works. Although he was financially tight at that time, he nonetheless promised Maran that he would try to find the money. Consequently, when he gave the cheque of $8,000 to Maran, he warned Maran that the cheque would only be honoured if he received some money from other debtors. Otherwise, the cheque would be dishonoured, which was exactly what happened.
 77.Maran then called B1 and further pleaded for some money. As a result, B1 handed over $3,000 in cash to him through his younger brother. B1 also asserted that no match could be rigged simply by $3,000.
 78.
 B2`s defence
B2`s defence was similar to B1`s in respect of the first charge, and he confirmed that he had asked B1 for money to repay Maran after he lost his bets with him. He also clarified that, when he received the cheque of $33,000 from Toh, he did not pass it to B1 but instead asked Gomes to collect it for Maran at his house instead as he was at that point in time under a police supervision order. Hence, after he collected the cheque from Toh at a coffee shop, he simply waited for Gomes to come and collect it. He denied that he knew B3 and had talked to B1 or Maran about any match-fixing at all. He also agreed that B1 was his good friend and benefactor.
 79.As for dealings with Maran, although B2 had not fixed any matches with Maran, Maran often placed bets with him. When he lost $38,000 to Maran sometime in May 1996, he asked B1 for an amount of $40,000 as he thought he could use the remainder of the money for a business which he was thinking of setting up. He had previously asked B1 for some money for the same purpose but B1 did not get back to him. After losing that much money to Maran, B2 did not bet with him anymore.
 80.During the trial, the prosecution also tendered documentary records from Singapore Telecoms which showed that on 6 August 1996, B2 had paged Maran on numerous occasions. This was the day when Woodlands Wellington played Balestier Central United and lost by five goals to one. B2 denied that these pages had anything to do with the Woodlands Wellington-Balestier Central match and he could have talked about something else with Maran or he could have paged him simply to disturb him.
 81.
 B3`s defence
B3 claimed that he did not know B1 or B2 but had known Maran since his school days. They had played football for the same team on many occasions. They were such good buddies that Maran often borrowed money from B3. When the trial started below, B3 recalled that Maran still owed him some money.
 82.Due to B3`s good performance on the field, he was called to join the national team in 1989. In 1996, he was recalled to the team. He claimed his performance was so outstanding that his club promised to extend his contract at the end of the season and increase his salary.
 83.Insofar as the two matches which he was accused of fixing, he denied them. During those matches, the team was going through a bad patch and had lost games which they should have won. Part of the reason which he gave was that there were some internal problems with the team and management of the club and that affected everyone`s morale. Further, several key players did not play in those matches as they were injured, and this weakened the team considerably. Every time they lost, the morale of the team went even lower. He was the team captain and remained so until the end of the season.
 84.When he was called up to the CPIB, he maintained his innocence throughout his detention. He was told that Maran had betrayed him and had implicated him in match-fixing allegations. When Chin and Sathia brought Maran to see him, Maran looked exhausted and close to tears. Maran admitted implicating him as he had no choice. His immediate reaction was one of anger and betrayal.
 85.On 9 May 1997, he was charged with match-fixing. A statement was taken from him then but, like on previous occasions, he denied any involvement. Any money which he received from Maran was only for the repayment of loans. Football was his one and only livelihood and he would not do anything to jeopardise it.
 86.There were several other short statements which B3 gave to the CPIB, and one where he lodged a police report on 18 March 1997 complaining about his treatment by CPIB officers. However, he later decided not to pursue the police report. Interestingly enough, in one of these statements, B3 stated that Maran had asked him to fix matches for B1 although no mention of any money was made. When the prosecution brought his attention to this statement, B3 insisted he could not recall ever saying such a thing although he also did not suggest that the statement was a fabrication by the relevant authorities.
 87.
 The trial judge`s decision
After an exhaustive examination of the evidence of both the prosecution and defence, and having regard to the law in this area, the trial judge was satisfied that the prosecution had made out its case beyond reasonable doubt and convicted all three accused accordingly.
 88.He held that, once the statements of B2 and Maran were properly admitted as evidence for the prosecution, they implicated the three accused of their respective charges, either directly or by the operation of s 30 of the Evidence Act, the section whereby a confession of an accused could be used as evidence against a co-accused. Further, Maran`s statements spelt out in detail his relationship with the three accused, and how B1, through B2, contacted him or handed him money after the match results were achieved by him, from which he passed some of these bribes to B3.
 89.Insofar as the accuracy of Maran`s statements was concerned, and the weight to be given to the statements, the trial judge was content to accept that it was a correct recollection of the exact state of events which took place. The essence of Maran`s statements was not about the minute state of affairs which took place but rather evidence that, viewed in totality, showed that there was a conspiracy between himself, B1, B2 and B3 which formed the offences in question. As a result, doubt was cast on Maran`s testimony in court, and the trial judge pointed out many loopholes which made it even more unbelievable. B1 and B3`s defence in court were also disbelieved for the same reasons.
 90.Finally, where B3 was concerned, the trial judge found that he had lied in his testimony. Since he was a good friend of Maran, there was every possibility that he had colluded with Maran as admitted in Maran`s statement. The trial judge also accepted that B3 had unwittingly confessed to his crime when one of his statements contained his admission that Maran had asked him for help to fix a match although no mention was made that B1 would pay them money. Referring to 
R v Lucas
 
[1981] QB 720
 which was approved by the Court of Appeal in 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
 , he found that B3 was trying to divert from any knowledge that he knew about the match-fixing allegations. These lies confirmed his guilt. Although B3 always maintained that the money which he received from Maran were repayments of loans which he borrowed, this was contradicted by Maran`s own statements.
 91.
 The appeal
I dealt with B3`s appeal against conviction first before setting out the reasons for my decision on sentencing in relation to the three accused.
 92.B3`s appeal was essentially divided into two broad divisions, the first relating to the trial judge`s decision admitting Maran`s statements as part of the prosecution evidence and the second dealing with B3`s evidence itself. It was common ground that without Maran`s statements, the prosecution did not have much of a case against B3. The gist of B3`s appeal was thus focused on the admission of those statements and the trial judge`s reliance on them.
 93.
 Maran`s statements
B3`s objections against the admission of Maran`s statements proceeded along these lines. These same arguments were canvassed before the trial judge in the court below, but were not accepted. It will be recalled that Maran was called as the prosecution`s witness. When the prosecution subsequently applied to treat him as a hostile witness, this was done during the prosecution`s examination-in-chief of him. Hence, B3 argued that the prosecution could not rely on s 147(3) of the Evidence Act to admit Maran`s statements. Section 147 only applied during the cross-examination of a person`s statement, and not during their examination-in-chief. By blurring the distinction between the admission of Maran`s statements during examination-in-chief and cross-examination, the trial judge was effectively disregarding s 139 of the Evidence Act, which contained the definitions of both examination-in-chief and cross-examination.
 94.The trial judge felt himself bound by the Court of Appeal decision of 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
. As a result, he rejected B3`s arguments. B3 tried to distinguish 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
 on the basis that that case focused on the working of s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code and not on the application of s 147 to one party`s own witnesses. The facts in 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
 were this: a victim of assault was put on the witness stand as the prosecution`s own witness. The respondent was charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt. The victim then gave evidence which was inconsistent with a statement which she gave earlier to the police complaining that she had been hurt by the respondent. The prosecution thereafter successfully impeached her credit using her former statement and then used the same statement as evidence of the facts stated therein under s 147(3). The judge at first instance refused to do so, on the basis that the statement was made under s 122 and could not be reconciled with s 147(3). The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.
 95.The trial judge, in respect of this issue, held (at [para ] 323 of his grounds of decision): 
Where Maran`s statements were concerned, the process of impeachment by cross-examination under ss 156 and 157 of the Evidence Act and then admitting the previous inconsistent statements for the truth of the matters in issue was precisely what happened in 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
 .
 96.In my opinion, there was no doubt that the trial judge was correct on the above issue. He was bound by the decision in 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
. Similarly, this court was bound by the same decision. While it was not expressly discussed in 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
, what emerged from that case was that when a prosecution applied to treat its own witnesses as hostile, and thereafter used the same witnesses` previous statement to impeach their credibility, both sections 147 and 157 came into play. As a result, by s 147(3), those statements of the witnesses which were used to impeach the witness`s credibility could then be admitted as the truth of the contents contained therein.
 97.B3 argued that this would then produce a bizarre conclusion, in the sense that s 147 was expressly meant to cover cases when a witness is 
 cross-examined 
. In the present case, by using s 147(3) to admit a statement for the truth of its contents, it blurred the difference between 
 examination-in-chief 
 and 
 cross-examination 
 as defined under s 139 of the Evidence Act.
 98.Section 139 of the Evidence Act, for all intents and purposes, state: 
(1) The examination of a witness by the party who calls him shall be called his examination-in-chief. 
(2) The examination of a witness by the adverse party shall be called his cross-examination.
 99.With respect, I found B3`s arguments, though attractive, untenable. To begin with, while s 139 purported to give the definitions of examination-in-chief, cross-examination and even re-examination, in my opinion, these definitions were not exhaustive. It could well be envisaged that there were other circumstances whereby one could have examination-in-chief or cross-examination without the witness ever being called by the party conducting the examination-in-chief. For example, it was well established that a trial judge retained a residual discretion to summon or call witnesses under s 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code (see 
Sim Cheng Hui v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 302
 ). In that case, the witness was called neither by the party conducting examination-in-chief or by the adverse party. Instead, she was called by the trial judge. However, the witness still underwent examination-in-chief or cross-examination.
 100.Moreover, as the trial judge rightly concluded, s 139 must be read with s 156 of the Evidence Act. Section 156 read: 
The court may, in its discretion, permit the person who calls a witness to put any questions to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party.
 101.In my view, through the working of s 156, the examination-in-chief of a hostile witness, as in the present case, effectively turned the testimony of the witness to cross-examination. Ultimately, whether a witness gave evidence during his examination-in-chief or cross-examination was dependent not by who called him but rather by the procedure in which the examination was conducted. That being so, if the witness was hostile such that he had to be treated with the same procedure afforded only under cross-examination (ie with leading questions), there was no reason why that process could not now be termed cross-examination, although strictly speaking the witness was still called by the party who is cross-examining him. In reality, examinations-in-chief and cross-examinations were simply general terms denoting the procedure of examining witnesses, and not defining terms indicating who called the witness to the stand. Although in most cases `cross-examination is usually considered in relation to the opponent`s witnesses and not one`s own` (see Pinsler 
Evidence Advocacy and the Litigation Process
 
[1992] at p 472
), in my view this was not an absolute rule. The crux of the issue was whether counsels could examine the witness through the use of leading questions and if the answer was in the affirmative, there was no reason why it could not be termed cross-examination, regardless of who called the witness to the stand.
 102.In the present case, once Maran was successfully treated as a hostile witness, whatever his testimony which the prosecution sought to elicit from him came about as a result of cross-examination, as it was done through the use of leading questions. This included the statements which he made to the CPIB. Consequently, the trial judge was correct when he allowed the prosecution to adduce his statements under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act for the truth of the contents as stated therein.
 103.B3 then argued that the procedure taken at the second voir dire determining the admissibility of Maran`s statements was not properly followed, which led to prejudice being caused to B3 in that the voluntariness of the statements was not and could not have been properly determined. Reliance was placed on a passage of the Court of Appeal in 
Seow Choon Meng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
 , where the Court of Appeal held (at p 861I): 
The admission of evidence otherwise inadmissible, particularly in criminal proceedings, could, we do not say it will, result n the whole proceedings being vitiated. In our view, it behoves all who are concerned with the conduct of criminal proceedings - judges, prosecutors and defence counsel, and also investigating officers who give evidence at trial - to be vigilant at all times to see to it that oral as well as written statements which are of the nature of admissions or confessions are not admitted in evidence without going through the time honoured and tested procedures that are part and parcel of our criminal justice system.
 104.In the present case, Maran took to the stand first, before the prosecution called their witnesses to give their version of events. Only after the prosecution witnesses were cross-examined was Maran cross-examined on the retraction of his statements made to the CPIB. As a result of the irregularity in proceedings relating to the admission of Maran`s statements, B3 argued that any determination made by the trial judge was extremely unsafe.
 105.While I appreciated B3`s concerns over the variation from the usual procedure in which the second voir dire was conducted, I felt that such a variation was immaterial to the outcome of the case and the trial judge`s decision as a whole. I have looked through the notes of evidence in the court below, and reviewed the circumstances leading to the admission of Maran`s statements and realised that Maran took to the stand first before the prosecution witnesses in the second voir dire as he was initially expected to give evidence in favour of the prosecution`s case. Unfortunately, he changed his mind during the trial and the trial judge thought it convenient to allow him to give evidence first before hearing the various CPIB officers` evidence as to the recording of those statements.
 106.Ultimately, the underlying concern for the proper procedure to be adhered to during voir dires was to prevent prejudice to the accused who was alleging improper treatment during the taking or recording of the statements but this issue was a non-starter in the present case. While B3 argued that prejudice was caused to him as a result of the way the second voir dire was conducted, he could not point to the manner of the prejudice, or the exact prejudice caused to him. He could not show that Maran`s statements, by the way the second voir dire was conducted, were not considered fully or carefully by the trial judge. This left me little choice but to conclude that the conduct of the second voir dire was a mere irregularity which mattered little during the whole trial in the court below.
 107.B3 also contended that the trial judge did not fully appreciate the difference between the admissibility of Maran`s statements as evidence in court and the weight to be attached to those statements but in my view, this argument was a non-starter in any event. He argued that the statements, having been altered or corrected numerous times, were inherently contradictory and unreliable in themselves and so more weight should have been accorded to Maran`s oral testimonies in court.
 108.I only needed to refer to the trial judge`s decision in this respect, which I thought countered B3`s arguments fully. At [para ] 399 and 400 of the grounds of decision, the trial judge made the observation: 
399 Maran changed his statement from para 13 onwards for the reason stated in that paragraph - ie that he was afraid that he would be charged if he had confessed earlier to receiving money from B1 to fix the two matches. That fear was not induced by the CPIB. it was something anyone with common sense would be aware of. He had been in CPIB before on such matters and he knew the consequences of admitting to match-fixing. He could not mention B3 earlier as he was the conduit between B1 and B3 and any mention of B3 would necessarily implicate himself. He had to tell the truth at that stage because he knew the CPIB had obtained Gomes` bank account book and Gomes was, in all likelihood, going to say that the $33,000 came from Maran. He had admittedly told Gomes that the money was winnings from bets and he knew that Gomes would repeat this to the CPIB officer interviewing him. Maran would then be in a quandary since he had failed to say all this in the two earlier statements. He was also in the `prisoner`s dilemma` as he did not know what the rest were telling the CPIB. He therefore had to `come clean` and tell the truth about the match-fixing and, in the process, implicate B3, his very good friend. 
400 Why then did Maran claim in court that his statement were nothing more than outright lies? He must have realised after leaving the CPIB that B1 and B3 had maintained their silence or had denied all allegations of match-fixing. He had `snitched` on them. B3 was a very good buddy of his while B1 was his friend and benefactor. He could also have harboured some fear of B1 as evidenced in para 23 of his statements. Maran was full of remorse, not for having lied about B1 and B3 in his statements but for having told the truth to the CPIB. He had played out or betrayed his co-conspirators while they had maintained the implicit code of silence or denial.
 109.Then, at [para ] 404, he continued: 
I was satisfied that the statements from para 13 onwards were accurate in the material particulars. As stated by the learned Chief Justice in 
 PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 (MA 195/96, judgement dated 3 June 1997, unreported), recollection of details of particular events may be susceptible to error with time, but the recollection of the existence of a relationship (such as one of employment in that case) is not malleable. Even if the details of the where and when of the conspiracy and the subsequent events may be a little hazy, the fact that there was a conspiracy involving all the accused and Maran to fix the two matches in issue was not susceptible to error even though ten months had elapsed. I was left with no doubt that Maran had spoken the truth in his statement and had chosen to lie in court.
 110.In my judgment, the decision of the trial judge spoke for itself. He gave full consideration to the admissibility, and then to the weight of Maran`s statements. True to say, Maran had changed his statements on many occasions but the trial judge reasoned, and this was undisputed by the defence, it was because he had begun to realise he could not lie anymore as those lies were slowly being uncovered. Thus, he had no choice but to confess and reveal the truth.
 111.This court has on many occasions stated that in the absence of any good reasons, findings of fact, especially in the present case on the truth of Maran`s statements, shall not be disturbed. Lest it be at the risk of repetition, I only needed to refer to the recent case of 
Soh Yang Tick v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 42
  for this proposition. There were no justifiable reasons for overturning the trial judge`s findings.
 112.
 B3`s evidence
I then turned to an evaluation of B3`s defence which he gave in court. It will be remembered that his defence was one of full denial, in that he was never part of Maran nor B1`s scheme to rig the results of any matches. If he had received any money at all from Maran, which he could not now remember, it was for what Maran owed him.
 113.The crux of B3`s contentions was that the trial judge failed to consider his evidence fully and reach the conclusion that he was not involved in any match-fixing allegations which Maran said he was. He relied on his instinctive reaction of denial when Maran saw him at the CPIB to persuade him to admit to match-fixing. He further challenged the fact that the trial judge took his defence as a pack of lies, and as corroborative evidence of his guilt. There was no evidence that he was playing below his ability.
 114.I found B3`s contentions in this respect unmeritorious. First, he could not provide a satisfactory explanation why Maran`s statements and B2`s statements tallied materially in many respects, both statements having been recorded independently at the CPIB without Maran and B2 meeting face to face. There were no allegations nor evidence that the CPIB had fabricated both their statements. In fact, both Maran and B2 denied knowing each other well, which led me to be convinced, as did the trial judge, that Maran and B2`s statements must be true in order to be so substantially similar. In terms of probability, it was highly unlikely that two statements, both alleged to be false, coincided in material respects, right up to the exact money figures contained therein in the statements. Furthermore, B3`s defence, though argued to be true, was very much unsubstantiated. It was easy for him to deny all knowledge of match-fixing but the evidence clearly showed otherwise.
 115.I should make it clear that, while there was indeed no evidence adduced by the prosecution which proved that B3 did play well below his best to `throw away` the football matches concerned, the absence of such evidence was not fatal to the prosecution`s case. Those who know the game would no doubt realise that football was but a team sport, and as a sport, it was extremely subjective when determining whether one played to his best ability or not, especially when there were 21 other players on the field playing the same game. There were no expert evidence in the court below testifying that B3 had played to his best, or below his capabilities. Moreover, once Maran`s statements were accepted as true and correct and B3`s defence rejected, it could be inferred that B3 did play below par to achieve the desired results which B1 told Maran. It was difficult to imagine that B3 would be compensated with some form of monetary gratification by either Maran or B1 if he had played his best to win matches. It should be noted that B3 did admit receiving money from Maran, but his explanation for receiving the money was unconvincing, to say the least, as there was no evidence to support it. In those circumstances, I formed the view that the prosecution had shown that B3 was guilty as charged.
 116.The present case involving the three accused, B1, B2 and B3, alleged them to be participants of a criminal conspiracy in an illegal act, namely corruption in the fixing of two football matches, whereby B1 paid B3 through B2 and Maran to achieve certain desired results for certain matches. The test for criminal conspiracy was found in the Court of Appeal decision of 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
 . In that case, the Court of Appeal held (at p 873G): 
The essence of a conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement will take place in private in such circumstances that direct evidence of it will rarely be available. In fact there is no requirement in law that the alleged conspirators should remain in each other`s company throughout or at all
 
One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy.
 117.This test was subsequently re-affirmed the case of 
 Sim Cheng Hui v PP 
.
 118.I had no doubt that the three accused were guilty of the two offences which I had set out much earlier as charged. All three played a pivotal role in ensuring that the whole conspiracy of match-fixing, from its organisation to its operation, was carried out and executed successfully. Without any of the accused, the whole scheme, albeit illegal, would not have succeeded. No doubt Maran had a big role to play in this whole conspiracy, but for apparent reasons, he was not charged. I was convinced that the trial judge came to the right conclusion when he convicted the three accused of the charges they faced. I was further reinforced in my view when B1 withdrew his appeal shortly before the hearing before this court in the light of the overwhelming evidence against them. There was every reason and evidence that Maran conspired with B1 and B2, then subsequently enlisted the help of B3, to ensure the outcome of the two football matches in question in the present case. While their defences thereafter given in the court below tallied in substance, it was likely that, after they were released from the CPIB, they met each other and came up with a generally consistent story. It cannot be over-emphasised that the trial judge made the observation, which I found particularly pertinent, that B2 and Maran`s statements coincided, and that they were most likely given before any of the three accused and Maran had a chance to meet and discuss the issue. In that instance, it was more likely than not that the statements represented the true state of affairs as compared to the three accused and Maran`s evidence in court.
 119.For the above stated reasons, I dismissed the appeal against conviction for B3.
 120.
 Appeal on sentences
Finally, I considered the various appeals brought by the Public Prosecutor against the sentences imposed on the three accused. It was argued that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate and should be enhanced. Of the three accused, only B1 was given a term of imprisonment of six months coupled with a fine. The rest were only fined. The prosecution argued that the trial judge failed to apply the deterrent principle and the sentences were out of line with the general body of case law which had built up over the last few years in this area. It was contended that match-fixing, in recent times, was a persistent and prevalent problem in Singapore and it destroyed the very spirit of sportmanship which required every player to give his best.
 121.The maximum sentence available to this court for the offences against the three accused was stated in s 120B(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224), read with s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Under s 120B(1) of the Penal Code, it is stated: 
Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for a term of 2 years or upwards shall, where no express provision is made in this Code for the punishment of such a conspiracy, be punished in the same manner as if he had abetted such offence.
 122.Under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the sentence available to the court was stated as a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.
 123.It was unnecessary for me to set out exhaustively the relevant principles to consider when a court passed its sentence, particularly in this area of the law. Over the years, a general body of case law has evolved, not least from this court, on those principles to be applied after the conviction of accused persons. Off hand however, some of these principles, which could be applied generally across the board, included the taking into account the facts of the offence, antecedents of the accused, mitigation, taking into consideration other offences, general thresholds and benchmarks of sentencing, the seriousness of the offence, the deterrent principle and protection to the public. In the present case, I found it useful to have regard for similar cases, considering like cases with like cases. This gave a prevailing idea as to the kind of sentences appropriate in the present instance.
 124.I considered the sentence imposed on B2 first, since there was no dispute that he was the least culpable of the three accused. It will be recalled that he was a mere conduit between B1 and Maran. While B1 was the mastermind behind the match-fixing allegations, he acted upon B1`s instructions by handing money over to Maran through Gomes in respect of the first charge and merely calling Maran where the second charge was concerned. There was no evidence that he was one of the masterminds of the offences in question, nor was it argued that his involvement was of any significance. If at all, it was minor. In such a case, I found the penalty of a fine imposed by the trial judge to be sufficient punishment. It was wrong to punish him for full involvement in the conspiracy to rig the results of matches as it was never proven that he had any major role in it, either by dictating what should be done or how it should be done. It seemed that he simply acted as he was told. To equate his sentence to one which B1 and B3 received would be a gross injustice. Even though the amounts involved in the present case were large, I found this immaterial where he was concerned. But for B1, he would never have committed the offences in question. Strictly speaking, it should be B1 who should bear the brunt of the offences, and not him. As a result, I left his sentence untouched, and dismissed the prosecution`s appeal in this respect accordingly.
 125.The prosecution did highlight B2`s numerous previous convictions and antecedents. As I have stated earlier, although these were relevant in determining the appropriate sentence to be given to him (see 
Leong Mun Kwai v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 338
  at p 342), I accepted the trial judge`s decision that he had fully considered them when passing his sentence. In that instance, it was unnecessary for me to tamper with his decision. Previous antecedents to be taken into account laid with the discretion of the court, and I was satisfied that the trial judge had exercised his discretion properly.
 126.In terms of culpability, next came B3, and while he was not the mastermind of the match-fixing allegations, he was one of the `operatives` of the scheme, meaning he successfully effected B1`s plan to set the results of the two soccer matches forming the substance of the charges against the three accused. This was a serious offence. In determining the appropriate sentence to be passed, I was guided by this court`s previous decision in 
 Kannan s/o Kunjiraman v PP 
. In that case, the first appellant, an ex-national football player, was sentenced to one year`s imprisonment and fined $40,000 on a similar conspiracy charge. He had colluded with the same accused in the present case, B1, to bribe the national goalkeeper at that time. In upholding the sentence of the first appellant, this court held (at p 763C): 
Counsel for the first appellant urged me to consider the first appellant`s illustrious career in soccer prior to his conviction and the impact the convictions had on it. Also, the first appellant`s family will suffer if he is sent to prison. These are of course relevant considerations, but it is inevitable that a criminal conviction will have an adverse impact on the first offender`s career. It is also inevitable that an accused`s family will suffer as a result of his imprisonment. Such sad consequences are unavoidable. On the other hand, the public interest must be protected. Soccer is a sport with a wide following. Offences of this nature have attracted much public attention lately. If left unchecked, they are capable of tarnishing the image of Singapore.
 127.I found this passage was equally applicable in the present case. Corruption in soccer must never be condoned. The wider public interest justified a severe sentence meted out for offenders. In recent years, the S-league has gained prominence on the local football scene, and its coverage on local television has increased. What started out as an experimental football league for various local clubs in Singapore has now become much of an international affair of high standards, with many professional foreigners earning a living playing football in Singapore. Many people, including youngsters, look up to these footballers, local and foreign, as examples to follow. If I were to be lenient to any particular footballer, as in this case to B3, it would send out a wrong message, not only to potential footballers playing in Singapore that we are not tough on football crimes, but also in setting a bad example to football fans for not preserving the name of the game in the spirit of sportsmanship.
 128.Having referred to 
 Kannan s/o Kunjiraman v PP 
, and to the two unreported cases of 
 PP v Abbas Saad 
 (DAC 20757/96) and 
 PP v Abdul Manap bin Hamat 
 (DAC 13762-9/97), I found the sentence given to B3 manifestly inadequate. In all the three cases mentioned, a sentence of imprisonment was given to the offenders concerned. B3`s original sentence of a fine was simply double what B2 received, which did not reflect the severity of the offence which he committed. It was patently obvious that B3`s culpability was more than doubled that of B2 in the two charges which they faced jointly. B3 was the captain of his team who, knowing he had to set a good example to his team mates and the public at large, nevertheless still played matches for money with the intention of losing them. This kind of behaviour was inexcusable. As this court pointed out in 
 Kannan s/o Kunjiraman v PP 
, the first appellant could easily have refused to fix matches. Similarly, in the present case, B3 had every opportunity to refuse to help B1 and Maran, but, instead of taking that correct route, went on to participate in the conspiracy of match-fixing not once but twice.
 129.Taking into account the profile of B3 as a player and captain of his team, I enhanced his sentence to one of two months` imprisonment for each offence, both sentences to run consecutively. The fines and penalties imposed were to stay, and not to be disturbed.
 130.Last but not least, there was the consideration of B1`s sentence. There was no question that B1 was the most guilty of the three accused, having masterminded and planned the whole conspiracy of match-fixing for his own benefit. The question which I considered was whether the total of six months` imprisonment which the trial judge imposed, coupled with a fine, was sufficient punishment for the offences which he committed.
 131.I answered the question in the negative. The prosecution helpfully referred me to many instances where B1 had been charged and convicted of match-fixing in other countries, most notably Malaysia. In fact, in 
 Kannan s/o Kunjiraman v PP 
, he also admitted to trying to fix the results of certain matches but was let off on that occasion. In those circumstances, it was clear that B1 was a person who, though punished on many other instances, had not learnt his lessons and mended his ways. Here was a person who was lucky to escape from the clutches of the law on many occasions but did not take them as opportunities to turn over a new leaf. On the contrary, the offences committed became more severe, as the amounts for match-fixing became larger. At a time when the authorities were trying their best to rid the sports world of menaces like him, I found it necessary to send out a strong message to those who intended to involve themselves in such illegal activities.
 132.Accordingly, I enhanced his sentence to one of 12 months` imprisonment for the first charge and one of six months imprisonment for the second charge, both to run consecutively. B1 had no excuse for what he was doing. He initiated the whole conspiracy, and dragged the other parties into it. He then tried to cover up these illegal activities. Ultimately, it was he who stood to gain when the match-fixing succeeded. I found no mitigating factors in his favour.
 133.In summary, I dismissed the prosecution`s appeal against B2`s sentence but allowed the appeals against the sentences of B1 and B3, after dismissing B3`s appeal against conviction. All three deserved their punishment, to varying degrees. It is hoped that the sentences imposed will send out a clear and unequivocal message to those who are currently involved in these illegal activities. The law will not smile on them.",1998-07-08 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
CHOO HAN TECK JC
 This is a claim for damages based on negligence and breach of statutory duty on the part of the two defendants which resulted in the death of one Tea King Nguang (the deceased), whose administrators are the plaintiffs suing on behalf of the estate. The first defendants were the occupiers of a shipyard. The second defendants were the contractors engaged by the first defendants to carry out various works, including the painting of a vessel called the `Solitaire`. At 6am of 9 August 1994, an explosion occurred at the stern block of the Solitaire. Five persons including the deceased were killed and many others injured. A committee of inquiry was convened by the Minister for Labour to investigate the cause of the explosion. The parties to this action accepted the report and findings of the Committee and decided that no further oral evidence was required. The Committee`s report was admitted in evidence through the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of Lim Fong Kuen the sole witness for the plaintiffs and also that of Ang Kok Hwee the sole witness for the two defendants. The notes of evidence at the inquiry were also admitted in evidence. In coming to my decision, I have, however, borne in mind that the conclusions of the Committee is a matter of the Committee`s opinion, but I accepted the findings of fact as these are not challenged by the parties.
 2.The salient facts are as follows. At the time of the explosion, that is, 6am on 9 August 1994, construction work was being carried on at the stern block of the Solitaire. The work on the vessel was done on a sectional basis. It was in the scheme of construction that when the stern block was completed it would be joined to the rest of the vessel which was undergoing modification elsewhere in the shipyard.
 3.The Committee found the probable cause of the explosion to be due to the ignition of inflammable gases in the enclosed space by the heat from the hot filament of non flame-proof lamps used by the workers. The first and second defendants were subsequently found guilty of breaches of statutory duties imposed by the Factories Act. The defendants do not deny liability but alleged that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence. The plaintiffs` counsel argued that any negligence if at all was caused entirely by the defendants. He submitted that the deceased was a victim of circumstances and was not involved in the affairs of the second defendants. He said that the fact that the deceased was the managing director is not a factor to be considered. The main dispute before me was whether there was any contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.
 4.After considering the arguments of counsel I found that the accident to be caused by the defendants but the deceased contributed to the accident. I apportioned his contribution in the proportion of 20% and the defendants 40% each. This was a case where the deceased was an active managing director who was on site from 11pm the previous evening until 6am the following morning. It was clear that he was overseeing the construction and this point was not challenged by the plaintiffs` counsel. It was, therefore, incumbent upon him to satisfy himself that the place of work was safe, and he ought to have been alerted to the enclosed space in which hot-works were being carried out. Further, he ought to have enquired whether all the necessary permits had been obtained. Hence, in allowing his workers to carry on working in those conditions constitutes a dereliction of duty on his part. A managing director who was `hands-on` at the site must assume greater responsibility than one who was not present.
 5.The active role played by the deceased was highlighted in various parts of the report of the Committee of Inquiry. Paragraph 3.6 at p 9 of the report stated as follows: 
Under the contract between [first defendants] and [second defendants], the latter was to carry out grit-blasting and painting of the six stern blocks and the two accommodation blocks. The [second defendants] was to provide labour, lightings and all necessary equipment for grit-blasting and painting. 
 The team which was involved in the work is as shown in Annex 8. This team was led by its Managing Director, [the deceased], and supervisor, Tay Keng Poo.
 The [second defendants] commenced work on Stern Block 1 in early July 1994. [My emphasis.]
 At para 6.7 the Committee found that just before the explosion a witness was walking towards the scene to check with the deceased on the progress of the painting work.
 6.The deceased must have been aware that the safety procedures were not in place. He was clearly under a duty at common law to ensure that all relevant safety precautions have been complied with. This included his duty to see that work should not begin unless the permit to commence had been issued. This is not merely a statutory duty, but a common sense, common law duty even though the requirement of the permit itself was a statutory requirement. The purpose of such a permit was clearly to indicate that all safety measures have been attended to. An absence of such a permit ought to raise the red flag of danger which any reasonable man must see and heed, but the deceased evidently did not. He failed to prevent or stop hot works taking place when non flame-proof lamps were in use. This was again, not merely an instance of a breach of statutory duty, but was also a breach of his common law duty to his work-mates. Some of the failures of the deceased contributed to the cause of the accident and the resulting breaches under the Factories Act by the defendant companies. In finding that the deceased contributed to the accident in failing to discharge his duty of care to his workers, I have taken into account the fact that the Committee of Inquiry found Tay Keng Poo, the supervisor of the second defendants, to have failed to take proper care to prevent the risk of fire. This finding does not exonerate the deceased of all blame.
 7.Counsel for the plaintiffs referred to 
Geetha v Hong Kong Teakwood Works (S) Pte Ltd
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 920
  in his opening statement in support of his submission that once a defendant had pleaded guilty to breaches under the Factories Act he is not entitled to plead contributory negligence. That case, in turn relied on the judgment of Lord Reid in 
Boyle v Kodak
 
[1969] 2 All ER 439
. In view of my findings that the breaches of duty were not solely breaches of statutory duty 
 Geetha 
`s case is not relevant. However, I feel bound to hold that I do not accept Mr Goh`s submission based on that case that where an employer is at fault he cannot set up the defence of contributory negligence against the employee. The courts would, however, normally be slow to find contributory negligence where an employer has been found to be in breach of his statutory duties, particularly where the fault of the employee lay merely in being inattentive to his job.
 8.The relevant part of 
 Geetha 
`s case which he relied on can be found at p 927 where the learned judge held: 
The judgment of Lord Reid in 
 Boyle v Kodak Ltd
 made it clear that an employer who is not at fault can set up the defence of contributory negligence. In our instant case the employer is at fault in that he had failed to comply with the statutory regulations on fencing of dangerous machinery.
 With respect, I do not think that 
 Boyle v Kodak Ltd 
 laid down such a principle. On the contrary, it appears from Lord Reid`s judgment, that even in cases of absolute liability, an employer can plead contributory negligence if the employee was at fault. The passage in 
 Geetha 
`s case set out above is not easy to understand. If an employer is not at fault, there would be no necessity at all to plead contributory negligence. At p 926, the learned judge held that in `
 Boyle v Kodak Ltd 
 the House of Lords did not find that the employee was guilty of contributory negligence`. With respect, that is not correct. In that case the appellant`s claim against his employers was dismissed by the trial judge and his appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed. However, on appeal to the House of Lords, their Lordships, by a majority, allowed his appeal but apportioned liability equally between the appellant employee and the respondent employers. Neither Mr Goh nor Mr Ong (for the defendants) before me referred to 
 Boyle v Kodak Ltd 
 and thus missed the point.
 9.The negligence of the first defendants lay firstly, in not making available information relating to the flammable ingredients of the paint that was used. It was the combination of the flammable paint and heat from an exposed lamp that directly caused the explosion. Secondly, it failed to provide a safe place of work for the contractors because the space where the critical work was being carried out lacked adequate ventilation.
 10.The negligence of the second defendants included the failure to obtain the necessary permit to commence work, the failure to isolate the hazard of combustible material from heat and the failure to issue sufficiently safe equipment to their workers. The Committee of Inquiry found the second defendants to have used `make-shift lights assembled in-house which did not have the safety features required of a flame-proof light`. The use of such lights was an instrumental cause of the explosion. The Committee also found that since work commenced in July 1994 `no night-shift foreman was appointed by the second defendants to supervise the work and ensure that it was done safely and that the work place was safe` (p 63 of the report). The deceased as the managing director of the second defendants must bear some responsibility for allowing non flame-proof lamps to be used and the failure to appoint a night-shift supervisor. The apportionment of liability between the two defendants where their negligence were not identical is not an easy task. In this case I can find no reason to find one more or less culpable. Thus, I apportioned blame equally as between the two defendants in the percentage of 40% each, and the degree of contribution by the deceased overall to be 20%.",1998-07-17 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
(delivering the judgment of the court): This is an appeal against the decision of S Rajendran J in the High Court awarding $20,000 in damages to Goh Chok Tong, the Prime Minister of Singapore and Secretary-General of the People`s Action Party (PAP), against Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam, a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament and Secretary-General of the Workers` Party (WP), in respect of certain words spoken by the latter concerning the former in the course of the 1996 General Elections. His decision is now reported at 
[1998] 1 SLR 547
. Both Mr Goh and Mr Jeyaretnam now appeal against the findings of the learned judge.
 2.
 The facts
The facts, which are set out at length in the judgment of the court below, may be summarised as follows. Parliament was dissolved in December 1996, and polling day fixed for 2 January 1997. Mr Jeyaretnam, together with one Tang Liang Hong and three others, elected to contest the Group Representative Constituency (GRC) in Cheng San against incumbent PAP MPs. Mr Goh defended his seat in the Marine Parade GRC.
 3.Leaders of the PAP, including Mr Goh, took the view that the election of Mr Tang to a seat in Cheng San was undesirable. They had received information that Mr Tang was an anti-Christian and anti-English-educated Chinese chauvinist, whose defence of Chinese culture, language and education in the past had been so vigorous that his introduction to Parliament might destabilise race-free politics in Singapore. They therefore undertook to advertise on numerous occasions, through press interviews and at campaign rallies, why they felt Mr Tang was an unsuitable candidate for a seat in the legislature.
 4.By a letter to Mr Goh dated 28 December 1996, Mr Tang, through his solicitors, denied the accusations, and, taking the view that Mr Goh`s statements were defamatory of his character, demanded a retraction and apology. He threatened that otherwise, he would seek legal recourse. Mr Goh`s solicitors replied by a letter dated 29 December 1996, refusing to give a retraction and inviting legal proceedings.
 5.Various PAP leaders and election candidates continued to repeat the accusations against Mr Tang over the course of the next few days. In an interview published in the 
 Straits Times 
 on 31 December 1996, Mr Tang indicated that he intended to lodge a police report against the various PAP members who had spoken against him as he was of the view that they had, in speaking what were allegedly falsehoods about him, committed a criminal offence. He said: 
Of course I am going to sue them. Not only that, I am going to lodge a police report against them for criminal offence. They are telling lies. They are defaming, assassinating my character. They concocted lies and go on television and spread the lies
 6.Mr Tang also publicly protested his innocence of the accusations at election rallies on 28 and 31 December 1996, adding that they had been fabricated to spoil his chances of success. On 31 December 1996, Mr Goh`s solicitors wrote to Mr Tang asking for a complete withdrawal of those allegations, an apology in prescribed terms, and an undertaking not to repeat his allegations. He was given an ultimatum - 6pm on 1 January 1997 to comply.
 7.Mr Tang`s response was to file two police reports against Mr Goh and other PAP leaders. He did not concede to any of the demands made by Mr Goh through his solicitors. Subsequent to the elections, in which Mr Tang and Mr Jeyaretnam were defeated in the Cheng San GRC, Mr Goh and other PAP members filed actions in defamation against Mr Tang in respect of the various statements he had made at rallies and to the press, and the police reports. Mr Tang failed to defend the claim and judgment was awarded against him with total damages assessed at $1,400,000 in respect of defamatory statements made by him concerning Mr Goh: see 
Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and other actions
 
[1997] 3 SLR 91
 . On appeal to this court, that sum was revised downwards to $700,000. Our decision was delivered on 12 November 1997 and is now reported at 
Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew & Anor
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 97
  (the Tang appeal).
 8.The present action arose out of events at a WP election rally held on the night of 1 January 1997, the eve of Polling Day. At this rally, Mr Jeyaretnam spoke after Mr Tang had spoken and, while Mr Jeyaretnam was speaking, Mr Tang was seen walking up to him, handing him certain documents and whispering to him. Shortly thereafter, as Mr Jeyaretnam was ending his speech, he said inter alia the following: 
and finally, Mr Tang Liang Hong has just placed before me two reports he has made to the police, against you know, Mr Goh Chok Tong and his people.
 Mr Goh subsequently, through his solicitors, wrote a letter of demand to Mr Jeyaretnam, demanding an apology in terms and damages. Mr Jeyaretnam, through his solicitors, denied the charges and offered to apologise on different terms. Mr Goh refused the apology, considering it inadequate, and instructed his solicitors to initiate this suit against Mr Jeyaretnam, pleading that the announcement amounted to an assertion that Mr Goh had committed the offence of criminal defamation.
 9.
 The judgment of the court below
In a lengthy judgment, S Rajendran J found that the words complained of did not bear the pleaded meaning, whether in the ordinary meaning of the words or in the innuendo meaning. He made his own findings on the ordinary meaning and the innuendo meaning of the words and on those meanings he held that the words were defamatory of Mr Goh. Both these meanings were less defamatory than the pleaded meaning. On the question of damages, he awarded Mr Goh a sum of $10,000 as general compensatory damages and another sum of $10,000 as aggravated damages, making a total of $20,000. Finally, he ordered Mr Jeyaretnam to pay Mr Goh only 60% of the costs.
 10.
 The appeals
Against this decision both Mr Goh and Mr Jeyaretnam appeal. Mr Goh`s appeal is against those parts of the trial judge`s decision as concerned (i) the quantum of damages awarded, and (ii) the proportion of costs disallowed. One of the grounds in the appeal against the award of damages is that the words complained of in their natural and ordinary sense and/or by innuendo bore substantially meanings that are more defamatory of him than the meanings found by the trial judge. In that sense Mr Goh is also challenging the meanings of the words as found by the trial judge. Mr Jeyaretnam`s appeal is against liability and is mainly directed at the defamatory meanings found by the trial judge. It is the case of Mr Jeyaretnam that the words did not bear the defamatory meaning as pleaded by Mr Goh or the meanings as found by the trial judge or any other defamatory meaning, and further, if at all they were defamatory, in all the circumstances Mr Goh is only entitled to no more than nominal damages. Mr Jeyaretnam also contends that irrespective of the outcome of his appeal the question of costs below should be considered by this court. The two appeals therefore focus on the following main issues: (a). what, if any, defamatory meaning the words complained of bore in the ordinary sense of the word, and what, if any, other meaning they bore taking into account extrinsic facts known to the ordinary man;
 (b). what is the appropriate quantum of damages in this case; and
 (c). whether in the circumstances of the case Mr Goh should be deprived of any proportion of the costs.
 11.
 The meaning of the words
We start with the meaning of the words as pleaded in the statement of claim. Only one defamatory meaning was pleaded, and that is in [para ] 32 of the statement of claim which is as follows: 
The offending words, and the words complained of in para 29, in their natural and ordinary meaning and/or by way of innuendo, meant and/or were understood to mean that the plaintiff had, inter alia, committed and was guilty of the offence of criminal defamation (which is punishable under s 500 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine or with both); and the offence of criminal conspiracy (which is punishable under s 120B(1) of the Penal Code with imprisonment).
 Below this paragraph were set out various particulars relied upon. This was claimed be the natural and ordinary meaning of the words and/or the innuendo meaning. In other words, Mr Goh ascribed only one meaning to the words, whether such meaning be the natural and ordinary meaning or the innuendo meaning or both. This was appreciated by the learned judge who said in [para ] 59 of his judgment: 
In this case I interpreted the pleading set out to mean that the defendant`s words had only one alleged meaning, which was based on the words either on their plain and ordinary meaning, reasonable implication arising out of those words or innuendo.
 12.The trial judge then proceeded to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. In approaching this issue he considered in some detail the decision of the House of Lords in 
Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1964] AC 234
 (the 
 Lewis 
 case), and also the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in England in 
Mapp v News Group Newspapers Ltd
 
[1998] 2 WLR 260
. He rejected the argument advanced on behalf of Mr Goh that the words implied that Mr Goh was guilty of criminal defamation and criminal conspiracy or a serious criminal offence and held that the words on their plain and ordinary meaning could not impute guilt. However, he held that the ordinary man on hearing that Mr Tang had lodged police reports against Mr Goh and his people `would consider that a police investigation into the affairs of [Mr Goh] might take place` and that was defamatory of him. The trial judge said at [para ] 90-92: 
90 I have no difficulty in concluding that such an event would give the ordinary person in Singapore reason to pause and think. The ordinary person would consider that a police investigation into the affairs of the plaintiff might take place 
91 Does that fact alone cause the plaintiff to be lowered in the estimation of the ordinary man? I am of the view that the ordinary man in Singapore is not so steeply cynical as to shrug off a matter such as a police investigation of a public official without a second thought. And, as I have stated, even if on reflection he were to dismiss the matter because he considers is very unlikely that anything would come out of the report, the broad, negative impression left on the audience is still actionable. 
92 I therefore find that the words spoken by the defendant are capable of defamatory meaning, not of the highest degree pleaded by the plaintiff, but of the lesser degree I have already expressed, that is, the ordinary man will come away with the impression that the plaintiff may have conducted himself in such a manner that it is possible he will be investigated for some offence or other
 13.The learned judge next turned to the innuendo meaning based on the extrinsic facts relied upon by Mr Goh. He found that the extrinsic facts had been proved and that the ordinary man would have been cognizant of those facts. In his view, the ordinary man possessing the special knowledge concerning the dispute between Mr Tang and Mr Goh would know full well the background against which Mr Jeyaretnam`s comments were made. Having considered all the extrinsic facts known to the ordinary man the learned judge turned to the vital question as to how `the ordinary man equipped with [the] knowledge` of those facts would have understood Mr Jeyaretnam`s statement that Mr Tang had made police reports against Mr Goh. The learned judge made further findings as to the inferences the ordinary man would draw from the background facts and came to the conclusion that although the words complained of were not capable of the meaning pleaded by Mr Goh, they bore the following meaning at [para ] 104: 
I am of the view that to the ordinary man the words must have imported that in Mr Tang`s view, the plaintiff had committed an act of serious enough proportions to merit a police report and that he was inviting an investigation into the truth of the allegations and counter-allegations which had formed the heart of the controversy involving Mr Tang and the plaintiff over the preceding days.
 14.The learned judge then went further: he considered and rejected the argument advanced on behalf of Mr Goh that Mr Jeyaretnam and Mr Tang took a united stand and `stood shoulder to shoulder` and that Mr Jeyaretnam adopted the words of Mr Tang when he made the statement complained of: see [para ] 105-116. He gave a defamatory imputation to the statement at the end of [para ] 117 and reiterated his finding of the defamatory meaning at [para ] 118 but in different words: 
In the present case, I consider the defendant`s words in their context to be defamatory for they carry the suggestion that the plaintiff may, in making those allegations against Mr Tang have done something wrong The words, taking into account the extrinsic facts, suggest not only that the plaintiff may be investigated for an offence, but go beyond that by suggesting the general nature and substance of the offence.
 15.Thus the learned judge found two separate meanings of the words complained of: one being the ordinary meaning and the other being the innuendo meaning based on the extrinsic facts known to the ordinary man, and he held that both were defamatory of Mr Goh.
 16.Counsel for Mr Jeyaretnam, Mr Gray, submits that the meanings found by the trial judge were so vague and nebulous as not to constitute a defamatory meaning at all. He contends that a statement that a police report has been made does not amount to an accusation of guilt, or even a suggestion of the possibility of guilt. He submits that such a statement is `totally neutral on the question of guilt or innocence` and that no reasonable fair-minded listener could possibly conclude from Mr Jeyaretnam`s statement that it was more likely than not that he was accusing Mr Goh of having committed a criminal offence. In this respect, reliance was placed on certain passages from the speech of Lord Reid (with whom Lord Jenkins concurred) in the 
 Lewis 
 case. Mr Gray accordingly submits that the statement did not amount to an accusation of guilt, or even an accusation of reasonable suspicion of guilt, but would invoke a wait-and-see response from the audience.
 17.Counsel for Mr Goh, Mr Davinder Singh, relies on a different passage from the speech of Lord Reid and also certain passages from the speech of Lord Devlin in the 
 Lewis 
 case and argues that Mr Jeyaretnam`s announcement that police reports had been filed by Mr Tang against Mr Goh and his people amounted, if not on its face, then by necessary implication, to a statement that he too felt that Mr Goh was guilty of the offence of criminal defamation.
 18.It is argued further that in the context, the audience was prepared to put a defamatory meaning on the words because it was well-known that Mr Jeyaretnam had long been opposed to the policies of the PAP government. Accordingly, any statement he made of Mr Goh would not be taken as having been made neutrally or objectively but would be interpreted in the only way Mr Jeyaretnam could have intended it - in the worst possible way against Mr Goh.
 19.Mr Davinder Singh further relies on the concession made by Mr Jeyaretnam in evidence that the announcement gave him some political mileage. He had admitted that the announcement was made to demonstrate that Workers` Party candidates were men of their word, and would do what they had promised: that Mr Tang had made good on his threat to file police reports against the PAP leaders.
 20.
 Finding on meanings
We turn first to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of. As the 
 Lewis 
 case and the speeches of Lord Reid and Lord Devlin have been referred to at great length by both counsel before us, it is necessary to consider that case in some detail. There, one John Lewis and a company, of which he was the chairman and managing director, took actions against the proprietors of the 
 Daily Telegraph 
 and 
 Daily Mail 
 respectively in respect of an article published in their newspapers. The article in each of the newspapers stated in substance that officers of the City of London Fraud Squad were inquiring into the affairs of the company. The statements of claim in each case alleged that the words complained of in their ordinary sense meant that the plaintiffs had been guilty of or were suspected by the police of being guilty of fraud or dishonesty. The defendants denied, inter alia, that the words meant or were capable of the meaning as alleged by the plaintiffs. At the trial, after the conclusion of the evidence, in the absence of the jury, the defendants asked the judge to rule that the words were not capable of the meaning that the plaintiffs attributed to them and to withdraw such alleged defamatory meaning from the jury for consideration. However, the trial judge declined, and in his direction to the jury he left it open to them to accept the meaning attributed by the plaintiffs. The jury found in favour of the plaintiffs and awarded substantial damages. On appeal the Court of Appeal set aside the award and ordered a new trial on the ground, inter alia, of misdirection by the trial judge. The plaintiffs appealed, and the House of Lords held that in a defamation case the trial judge must rule whether the words complained of were capable of bearing the defamatory meaning put forward by the plaintiffs. It was there accepted that the words were defamatory of the plaintiffs, and the main controversy was whether the words were capable of the meaning attributed by the plaintiffs. The House by a majority held that they were not. In addressing this issue Lord Reid said at p 258: 
The gist of the two paragraphs is that the police, the City Fraud Squad, were inquiring into the appellants` affairs. There is no doubt that in actions for libel the question is what the words would convey to the ordinary man: it is not one of construction in the legal sense. The ordinary man does not live in an ivory tower and he is not inhibited by a knowledge of the rules of construction. So he can and does read between the lines in the light of his general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs
 
What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning. Here there would be nothing libellous in saying that an inquiry into the appellants` affairs was proceeding: the inquiry might be by a statistician or other expert. The sting is in inferences drawn from the fact that it is the fraud squad which is making the inquiry. What those inferences should be is ultimately a question for the jury, but the trial judge has an import duty to perform.
 
Generally the controversy is whether the words are capable of having a libellous meaning at all, and undoubtedly it is the judge`s duty to rule on that. I shall have to deal later with the test which he must apply
 Having set out this approach his Lordship went on to propound the test which a judge should adopt in considering whether the words are capable of the meaning attributed by the plaintiffs, at p 259: 
In this case it is, I think, sufficient to put the test in this way. Ordinary men and women have different temperaments and outlooks. Some are unusually suspicious and some are unusually nave. One must try to envisage people between these two extremes and see what is the most damaging meaning they would put on the words in question.
 and continued at p 260: 
What the ordinary man, not avid for scandal, would read into the words complained of must be a matter of impression. I can only say that I do not think that he would infer guilt of fraud merely because an inquiry is on foot. And, if that is so, then it is the duty of the trial judge to direct the jury that it is for them to determine the meaning of the paragraph but that they must not hold it to impute guilt of fraud because as a matter of law the paragraph is not capable of having that meaning.
 21.Lord Devlin adopted a similar approach and said at p 277: 
[T]he natural and ordinary meaning of words ought in theory to be the same for the lawyer as for the layman, because the lawyer`s first rule of construction is that words are to be given their natural and ordinary meaning as popularly understood. The proposition that ordinary words are the same for the lawyer as for the layman is as a matter of pure construction undoubtedly true. But it is very difficult to draw the line between pure construction and implication, and the layman`s capacity for implication is much greater than the lawyer`s. The lawyer`s rule is that the implication must be necessary as well as reasonable. The layman reads in an implication much more freely; and unfortunately, as the law of defamation has to take into account, is especially prone to do so when it is derogatory.
 In the course of his speech his Lordship (at p 284) dealt with an argument put forward by counsel for the plaintiffs to the effect that there was no difference between saying that a man was guilty of fraud and saying that he was suspected of fraud and said at p 285: 
It is not, therefore, correct to say as a matter of law that a statement of suspicion imputes guilt. It can be said as a matter of practice that it very often does so, because although suspicion of guilt is something different from proof of guilt, it is the broad impression conveyed by the libel that has to be considered and not the meaning of each word under analysis. A man who wants to talk at large about smoke may have to pick his words very carefully if he wants to exclude the suggestion that there is also a fire; but it can be done. One always gets back to the fundamental question: what is the meaning that the words convey to the ordinary man: you cannot make a rule about that. They can convey a meaning of suspicion short of guilt; but loose talk about suspicion can very easily convey the impression that it is a suspicion that is well founded.
 Mr Davinder Singh relies heavily on this passage and argues by analogy that Mr Jeyaretnam had not chosen his words carefully and in making the statement of police reports having been made against Mr Goh had failed to exclude the suggestion that Mr Goh was involved in a criminal offence. We are unable to agree. This passage was said obiter and has no relevance to the facts before us. Indeed, it had no application in that case also. Immediately following that passage Lord Devlin said at p 285: 
In the libel that the House has to consider there is, however, no mention of suspicion at all. What is said is simply that the plaintiff`s affairs are being inquired into. That is defamatory, as is admitted, because a man`s reputation may in fact be injured by such a statement even though it is quite consistent with innocence But a statement that an inquiry is on foot may go further and may positively convey the impression that there are grounds for the inquiry, that is, that there is something to suspect. Just as a bare statement of suspicion may convey the impression that there are grounds for belief in guilt, so a bare statement of the fact of an inquiry may convey the impression that there are grounds for suspicion. I do not say that in this case it does; but I think that the words in their context and in the circumstances of publication are capable of conveying that impression.
 and continued at p 286: 
Let it be supposed, first, that a statement that there is an inquiry conveys an impression of suspicion; and secondly, that a statement of suspicion conveys an impression of guilt. It does not follow from these two suppositions that a statement that there is an inquiry conveys an impression of guilt. For that, two fences have to be taken instead of one. While, as I have said, I am prepared to accept that the jury could take the first, I do not think that in a case like the present, where there is only the bare statement that a police inquiry is being made, it could take the second in the same stride.
 22.In that case the House of Lords was concerned only with the issue whether as a matter of law the statement that the plaintiffs were under investigation by the fraud squad was capable of bearing the meaning that the plaintiffs were guilty of fraud or were suspected of having committed fraud. So the question whether the statement bore that meaning - which was a question for the jury - did not even arise, as the House held that the statement was not even capable of bearing that meaning.
 23.A similar situation arose in the very recent case in England, 
Mapp v News Group Newspapers Ltd
 
[1998] 2 WLR 260
. In that case, the newspaper carried a report to the effect that a police sergeant had committed suicide after being ordered to provide information about ex-colleagues accused of peddling drugs, that he was a custody officer with the drug squad at a London police station when eight fellow officers were alleged to have been involved in drug dealing and bribery, and that these officers had been transferred to other police stations while an investigation was carried out. Four of the eight officers complained that the report was libellous of them and brought actions against the owners of the newspapers. Their statements of claim alleged that the words complained of meant and were understood to mean that the officers were guilty of drug dealing and bribery and that the sergeant had killed himself because he would otherwise have had to confirm the plaintiffs` involvement. The defendants applied for an order under O 82 r 3A of the Rules of Supreme Court for an order that the words were incapable of bearing the meaning alleged. The judge at first instance refused to make the order. The defendants appealed, and the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal holding that the words were incapable of the meaning attributed by the plaintiffs. Hirst LJ delivering the main judgment of the court said at pp 267-268: 
The passages quoted from Lord Devlin`s speech [ie no smoke without fire] in 
 Lewis
`s case 
[1964] AC 234
 are of course very pertinent, but they must be read in the context of a case where the House of Lords held unanimously that the reference to a fraud squad inquiry was capable of imputing reasonable suspicion but not capable of imputing actual guilt. There is thus no question of Lord Devlin in that case sanctioning the double jump from inquiry via suspicion to guilt.
 
In my judgment, in the light of Lewis`s case, it would be virtually unarguable to suggest that the words complained of here imputed actual guilt as contrasted with a reasonable suspicion of guilt unless, as Mr Shields suggests, their meaning is transformed by the prominent reference to Sergeant Carroll`s suicide. I do not think it has this effect since, to my mind, Sergeant Carroll`s suicide could be interpreted by the reasonable reader in a number of different and perhaps more plausible ways; for example, that he himself had something to hide which would come out if he had to respond to his superior`s order, or that he was overwhelmed by stress or depression. As Lord Blackburn said in a celebrated passage in 
Capital and Counties Bank Ltd v Henty
 
[1882] 7 App Cas 741
, p 786: `it is unreasonable that when there are a number of good interpretations, the only bad one should be seized upon to give a defamatory sense to the document`.
 
 
Consequently, I would hold that the words are incapable of imputing actual guilt, as contrasted with suspicion, to any of the eight officers.
 24.We return to the case at hand. We agree with the trial judge that Mr Jeyaretnam`s statement that Mr Tang had filed police reports against Mr Goh and his people was one step removed from the statement in question in the 
 Lewis 
 case. Taking the words in the statement only in the literal sense, they amounted to no more than an assertion that police reports had been made by Mr Tang against Mr Goh and his people. But the sting here lies in the inferences to be drawn from the words used in the context in which the words were said by Mr Jeyaretnam. Such inferential meaning is also the natural and ordinary meaning.
 25.In considering the inferences to be drawn it is relevant to bear in mind the observations made by the Court of Appeal in England in 
Skuse v Granada Television Ltd
 
[1996] EMLR 278
, p 285: 
 
(2) The hypothetical reasonable reader [or viewer] is not nave but he is not unduly suspicious. He can read between the lines. He can read in an implication more readily than a lawyer, and may indulge in a certain amount of loose thinking. But he must be treated as being a man who is not avid for scandal and someone who does not, and should not, select one bad meaning where other non-defamatory meanings are available. 
 
(3) While limiting its attention to what the defendant has actually said or written, the court should be cautious of an over-elaborate analysis of the material in issue. We were reminded of Diplock LJ`s cautionary words in 
Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1968] 2 QB 157
 at p 171: In the present case, we must remind ourselves that this was a factual programme, likely to appeal primarily to a seriously minded section of television viewers, but it was a programme which, even if watched continuously, would have been seen only once by viewers, many of whom may have switched on for entertainment. Its audience would not have given it the analytical attention of a lawyer to the meaning of a document, an auditor to the interpretation of accounts, or an academic to the content of a learned article. In deciding what impression the material complained of would have been likely to have on the hypothetical reasonable viewer we are entitled (if not bound) to have regard to the impression it made on us. 
(4) The court should not be too literal in its approach. We were reminded of Lord Devlin`s speech [in the 
 Lewis 
 case]: 
[The court then set out the first passage of his Lordship`s judgment which we have reproduced at [para ] 21 above.]
 26.In that case, the issue was whether the defendant television company had, in a television report, asserted that the plaintiff, a government scientist, had acted negligently in carrying out tests to determine the presence of nitro-glycerine on the hands of two defendants in the trial of the Birmingham Six. The High Court ordered a trial of a preliminary issue whether the words complained of were defamatory of the plaintiff, and, if so, whether they bore the defamatory meaning attributed by the plaintiff or some lesser meaning, and, if so, what meaning. On this issue the judge at first instance held that the words were defamatory of the plaintiff and bore the meaning that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the plaintiff had been negligent and that this caused or contributed to the wrongful imprisonment of the Birmingham Six. The plaintiff appealed, arguing that the words amounted to a suggestion that, more than being reasonably suspected of it, he had actually been negligent. The Court of Appeal concluded that although a lawyer might distinguish between negligence and reasonable grounds to suspect negligence, that distinction would not be made by a viewer of a `hard-hitting, arresting, quickly-moving television programme.`
 27.With these considerations in mind we now consider what inferences the ordinary man would draw from the words complained of as uttered by Mr Jeyaretnam. We agree with the trial judge that to the ordinary man the words would not imply that Mr Goh was guilty of criminal defamation and criminal conspiracy or a serious criminal offence; they would not impute guilt. But the ordinary man, having heard the statement that Mr Tang had made police reports against Mr Goh and his colleagues, would understand that Mr Tang, being a lawyer and politician, `having avowed to protect his reputation and integrity` had taken a serious step and made police reports against Mr Goh, and that it would be likely that the police would investigate into some wrong doings alleged in the reports on the part of Mr Goh. In our opinion, that was the natural and ordinary meaning conveyed to the ordinary man, and the words bearing such meaning were defamatory of Mr Goh.
 28.We now turn to the innuendo meaning which was also pleaded in the statement of claim. In this connection, Mr Goh relied on various extrinsic facts to support the meaning contended. On this point, the trial judge made two important findings of fact. First, he found that the following extrinsic facts had been proved: that it was Mr Goh who initiated the attacks on Mr Tang by publicly denouncing him as an anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist in the local newspapers; that Mr Goh had premised those views on information he had received from other PAP MPs concerning Mr Tang; that Mr Tang at recent rallies had accused Mr Goh and his colleagues of concocting and spreading lies about him; that Mr Tang had written a letter of demand to Mr Goh demanding a retraction and that Mr Goh had refused and invited Mr Tang to sue him; and that Mr Tang had said publicly that he intended to report Mr Goh and his colleagues for having committed criminal offences, namely, for having concocted and spread lies about him. Secondly, the trial judge found that these extrinsic facts were known to the ordinary man attending the rally in question that evening.
 29.Now, the question is how the ordinary man equipped with the knowledge of these facts would understand the statement by Mr Jeyaretnam that Mr Tang had lodged police reports against Mr Goh and his colleagues. On this question, we agree with the following findings made by the trial judge at [para ] 103: 
He [the ordinary man] would have understood that Mr Tang had made good on his threat to file a police report. He would also know that the report related to serious charges. He would have inferred that the report related to the debate between the plaintiff and Mr Tang, in particular Mr Tang`s allegation that the plaintiff was telling lies and concocting falsities about him to frustrate his election campaign. He would have inferred from the fact that the report to the police was made against a person as prominent as the plaintiff that it would not be taken lightly by the police. Whether the ordinary man would know enough to call these offences by their legal labels of criminal defamation and criminal conspiracy is not relevant so long as there is common ground between what he understands Mr Tang`s allegations against the plaintiff to be and the elements of those offences.
 30.In these circumstances, taking into account the extrinsic facts known to the ordinary man, the statement made by Mr Jeyaretnam bore the meaning that Mr Goh had done something seriously wrong in launching the attacks against Mr Tang and that Mr Goh would be likely to be investigated for the offence or offences alleged in the reports. The trial judge in his finding of the innuendo meanings found that the words, taking into account the extrinsic facts, suggested not only that Mr Goh may be investigated for an offence but also the general nature of the offence. In our opinion, the words suggested more than that an investigation was possible: they suggested that Mr Goh would be likely to be investigated for the offence or offences alleged in the reports.
 31.
 Lesser meaning than pleaded
Both the natural and ordinary meaning and the innuendo meaning as found by us are substantially the same as those found by the trial judge. In our judgment, the words both in the natural and ordinary meaning and in the innuendo meaning as found by us are defamatory of Mr Goh, but they are less injurious than the defamatory meaning pleaded by Mr Goh. It is the contention of Mr Gray that in a defamation action the plaintiff must prove the defamatory meaning as pleaded in his statement of claim and if he fails to do so his claim must fail. In particular, in the case of an innuendo meaning, the plaintiff `is pinned precisely` to his pleaded meaning and proof of a lesser meaning will not suffice. In support Mr Gray relies mainly on New Zealand and Australian cases, to which we now turn.
 32.The highest persuasive authority is 
Truth (NZ) v Holloway
 
[1960] 1 WLR 997
. There, the defendant published in their newspaper an article referring to a conversation with one J about the procedure of obtaining import licences in New Zealand, and J was reported to have said: `see Phil and Phil would fix it `. By `Phil` it was understood that it referred to the plaintiff who was then the Minister of Industries and Commerce of New Zealand. The plaintiff sued the defendant claiming that the words were defamatory of him and pleaded, inter alia, an `innuendo` that the words meant that the plaintiff had acted and was prepared to act dishonourably in connection with the issue of import licences. He succeeded in his claim and the defendant appealed and the appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand. The defendant then appealed to the Privy Council which dismissed it. Lord Denning delivering the judgment of the Board said, at pp 1000 -1001: 
Once the plaintiff had acknowledged that the words were not defamatory of him when taken in their natural and ordinary meaning, then it was absolutely incumbent on him to prove they bore the meaning alleged in the innuendo. If he only proved a lesser meaning, he would fail. A good illustration was given in the course of the argument. The innuendo in this case imputed that the plaintiff `has acted and is prepared to act dishonourably`. That is an imputation of 
 guilt
 The reason is this: If the plaintiff had by his innuendo said the words only imputed 
 suspicion
, it would be open to the defendant to plead justification if it had sufficient evidence at its disposal to warrant suspicion: but as the plaintiff says that the words impute 
 guilt
, the defendant cannot justify that meaning unless it has sufficient evidence to prove guilt, which is, of course, a higher burden than proving suspicion. So as matter of pleading, in order not to put the defendant to any disadvantage, the plaintiff is pinned to his innuendo.
 33.With reference to this passage, we have two observations. First, that case was not a case of defamation based on a true innuendo. What the plaintiff relied on was a `false` innuendo, ie the inferential meaning which is also part of the ordinary meaning of the words: see the 
 Lewis 
 case (supra). Second, that case was decided in 1960, and having regard to subsequent cases, which we shall discuss in a moment, it is doubtful that what Lord Denning said is still the law. It does not appear to us to be the position in England.
 34.Next, the case of 
James v New Zealand Tablet Co
 
[1976] 2 NZLR 546
. There, the plaintiff pleaded that the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning were defamatory of him, but he did not plead the alleged defamatory meaning. The defendant sought an order for particulars to be given by the plaintiff as to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words alleged, and an order was made by Somers J requiring the plaintiff to spell out the natural and ordinary meaning he alleged. The learned judge said, at p 552: 
The present case, in my view, is one where the plaintiff should set out the meaning, inference or imputation he relies on. A number of possible meanings to be attributed to the words was canvassed at the hearing I do not propose to comment on those and other suggestions, much less determine whether the words are capable of bearing all or any one or more of those meanings. What is important is that in my view the defendant is embarrassed and in particular, without knowing the imputation or imputations made, cannot determine whether to justify, to apologise or otherwise plead.
 We respectfully agree with the view expressed by the learned judge. We agree that a plaintiff in a defamation suit must plead the defamatory meaning he says the words complained of bear and give particulars, if any, he relies upon in support of that meaning. However, that case does not support what Mr Gray contends.
 35.In 
Broadcasting Corp of New Zealand v Crush
 
[1988] 1 NZLR 234
, the plaintiff sued the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation and certain newspapers in respect of a report they published alleging that he sold certain property to the Ministry of Works and Development at an excessive price and that the Auditor-General`s office were making investigation into the circumstances relating to the sale. In the statement the plaintiff pleaded `false` innuendo meanings. The defendants denied that the publications bore or were capable of bearing any of the defamatory meanings pleaded by the plaintiff. They further pleaded their own meanings of the words complained of and sought to justify those meanings. On application by the plaintiff to strike out this part of the defence the High Court held that the meanings pleaded by the defendants were incapable of being defamatory, and struck out the meanings as pleaded by the defendants and the defence of justification of those meanings. On appeal this decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand. Both before the High Court and the Court of Appeal the plaintiff conceded that he was bound by the alleged natural and ordinary meanings as pleaded, and unless the words bore in substance one or more of those meanings his claim could not succeed. Cooke P made the following observations at p 239: 
For the plaintiff in the present case Mr Carruthers has made the same disclaimer or concession in both courts. That being the accepted position, the trial judge will have to put to the jury that the plaintiff`s case stands or falls by proving at least one of the meanings alleged by him. It will be necessary also for the judge to explain to them that if the plaintiff had set out to prove some lesser defamatory meaning the defendant would have been entitled to seek to prove to the satisfaction of the jury that in that different meaning the words were true.
 
We add only that we are disposed to think that a jury could reasonably find a lesser meaning or sting, namely that the whole affair, including the plaintiff`s part in it, was suspicious. That is not far removed from one of the meanings alleged by the plaintiff, namely that the plaintiff`s conduct was under investigation by the Audit Office, but it is not the same; one would not normally expect the Audit Office to be investigating the conduct of a private citizen.
 
In view of the disclaimer or concession made by counsel for the plaintiff as already mentioned (which seems to us entirely proper and sensible) it becomes unnecessary to decide whether a plaintiff who has pleaded a specific natural and ordinary meaning as a `false` innuendo can 
 without notice
 fall back at the trial on some lesser defamatory meaning. There is a good deal to be said for the view that he cannot - at least unless his pleadings make it clear that he is reserving that right.
 His Honour did not express a concluded opinion on the issue before us. This case therefore is not of much assistance to us.
 36.We now come to the Australian authorities. First, the case of 
Hadzel v De Waldorf
 
[1970] 16 FLR 174
. That was a case of slander, and parts of the matters pleaded by the plaintiff were in the natural and ordinary meanings capable of being defamatory, while other parts were not or were of doubtful effect. The defendant applied for particulars of the defamatory imputations and Fox J allowed the application. In giving his judgment, the learned judge went further to consider the case of 
Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1968] 2 QB 157
 and referred to the judgments of Lord Denning MR, Diplock LJ and Salmond LJ and expressed his preference for the view of Salmon LJ, which was to the effect that the plaintiff is bound by his pleaded meaning and what he set up at the trial must come broadly within the meaning he has pleaded and it would not be permissible for him at the trial to rely on an entirely different meaning, even if that meaning is less injurious than the meaning he has pleaded. This part of the judgment of Fox J was obiter and is not a clear authority on the point before us.
 37.Mr Gray refers also to the case of 
Tarkanyi v Mirror Newspapers
 
[1983] 2 NSWLR 698
. We have considered that case, but it is not clear to us how that case can assist his submission that the court cannot find a meaning, whether it be the natural and ordinary meaning or the innuendo meaning, which is less defamatory than that pleaded by the plaintiff.
 38.The authority which is more in point and which supports Mr Gray`s arguments is the South Australian case of 
Prichard v Krantz & Ors
 
[1984] 37 SASR 379
. There, the plaintiff was a member of the Federated Clerks Union and brought an action against two other members in respect of a publication by the latter headed `$100,000 GOLDEN HANDSHAKE` in which they referred to the statement made by the plaintiff before an inquiry that he `would be open to a $100,000 golden handshake`. The publication ended with a statement to the effect that the plaintiff `would have been happy to walk off with $100,000 of members` money`. In the statement of claim the plaintiff pleaded, inter alia, that the natural and ordinary meaning of those words was that the plaintiff would `rob, plunder, embezzle, carry off, swindle, defraud other members of the union of $100,000`. The defendants denied that the words were capable of bearing the meanings attributed to them by the plaintiff and did not proceed to justify any such meanings. They also pleaded qualified privilege and fair comment. At the trial before the district court the defendants sought clarification from the plaintiff whether he would amend the statement of claim by pleading a lesser defamatory meaning, and if so the defendants would wish to plead justification in respect of the lesser defamatory meaning. The plaintiff refused to amend the pleadings and stood by the meanings he contended. He indicated that he was prepared to accept the court`s decision on the meanings as pleaded. The judge after the conclusion of the evidence of the plaintiff upheld the submission of the defendants that there was no case to answer on the ground that the words were not capable of the meanings pleaded by the plaintiff and dismissed the claim. The plaintiff appealed and the Supreme Court of South Australia dismissed the appeal. King CJ who delivered the main judgment of the court said: 
a plaintiff is in some sense bound by the meanings which he attributes to the words in his statement of claim. It seems to me, moreover, that the passages cited above from 
Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1964] AC 234
 as to the desirability of pleading the meanings attributed to the words and the cases in which particulars have been ordered, are posited on that view of the law. An allegation of the meanings to be attributed to the words used, whether in a statement of claim or by way of particulars supplied in compliance with an order, serves no good purpose, and may perhaps be a trap for a defendant, if those meanings can be ignored at trial and other meanings relied upon. The purpose of pleadings and of particulars is to define the issues at trial and to give the opposing party fair notice of the case to be made against him. A defendant needs to know the meanings attributed to the words by the plaintiff in order to decide whether to assert that the words do not bear those meanings, to justify the meanings or to apologise.
 
A plaintiff would not, of course, be confined to a precise nuance and shade of meaning pleaded or particularized. Modern judges, in any case, have a considerable discretion as to the rigour with which they will confine a case presented by a party to the precise language of the pleadings. In many cases, moreover, the more serious allegation can be regarded as including the less serious. In that sense, the court is free to attribute to the words a less injurious meaning than that attributed to them in the pleading. An allegation that the words used mean that the plaintiff is a rapist no doubt includes a meaning that he has been guilty of a less serious type of sexual assault. An allegation that the words mean that a person is a robber no doubt includes a meaning that he has taken property by criminally dishonest means falling short of robbery. It seems to me, however, that it would be contrary to the purpose of pleadings and particulars if a plaintiff could obtain a judgment upon the basis of a meaning of the words used which was not merely a less serious form of the imputation pleaded, but amounted to an imputation of a substantially different kind.
 39.It seems to us that that case was really an extreme one. First, the plaintiff attributed to the words, as King CJ said, very strained and unnatural meanings which the words could not possibly bear. Secondly, the plaintiff refused at the trial to amend the pleadings by alleging a less defamatory meaning and steadfastly stood by the meanings he had pleaded. Indeed, he went further: before the court he took the position that the pleaded meanings were the only meanings he relied on and no others, and was prepared to accept the decision of the court on those meanings. In the circumstances, court had no alternative but to decide solely on what he had pleaded, and as the court`s decision was that the words were not capable of bearing the meaning - which is a question of law - the court must dismiss the claim.
 40.Lastly, there was the case of 
Taylor & Ors v Jecks
 
[1993] WAR 309
 decided by the Supreme Court of Western Australia. There, the plaintiff sued the defendants for defamation and in his pleadings he set out nine sub-paragraphs of `false` innuendoes which he alleged the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning bore. The defendants applied to strike out all but the first of these sub-paragraphs. The Master who heard the application struck out only one paragraph holding that there was no obligation on the part of the plaintiff to plead innuendoes, where it was contended that the words were defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning. The defendants appealed and the Supreme Court of Western Australia allowed the appeal in part by striking out only certain of the sub-paragraphs sought by the defendants. Anderson J, who delivered the main judgment of the court, held that as a rule of practice the plaintiff should plead the meanings which he contends arise from the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning. The plaintiff must plead the defamatory sense of the words, except where the defamatory sense is so clear that enlargement is obviously unnecessary. The learned judge did not really express a concluded view that the plaintiff is bound by the defamatory meaning of the words complained of which he has pleaded and if he fails to establish that meaning at the trial but a lesser defamatory meaning, his claim would fail. He said at pp 316-317: 
Usually the jury will be asked to find whether the words complained of bear all or any of the meanings set out for them by the judge. Usually the judge, in formulating the various imputations for the jury to consider, will have close regard to the pleadings or, at all events, to those imputations on which issue had been fairly joined at trial. Of course, it is accepted that the plaintiff is not tied to the precise meaning set out in his pleading, nor is the jury confined to the precise meaning as formulated for them by the judge. This latitude is usually conveyed to the jury by the addition to the questions put to the jury of the phrase `or any similar meaning defamatory of the plaintiff` I think it is more often than not the case that the jury will be asked to find for or against specific imputations that will have been formulated for them by the judge with the assistance of counsel and by reference to the pleadings, or any imputations 
 similar
 to those imputations, rather than that they will be asked simply to say at large whether the materials are defamatory of the plaintiff.
 Again, we do not find that this case supports Mr Gray`s arguments.
 41.We now come to the leading English case of 
Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1968] 2 QB 157
. The facts were briefly these. For many years S was a town clerk of Hammersmith Council, and the Council had put up a notice signed by S forbidding cycling along a narrow lane known as the Upper Mall which was by the side of the river Thames and along which the public had a right of way. Later S retired and became the legal adviser to a company V Ltd which had a factory adjoining the Upper Mall, and on behalf of the company had been trying to claim a right of way for vehicles over it. The defendants published in their newspaper a letter written by H headed `Double Think` which was critical of S and V Ltd. Following that the newspaper published a reply by G, the chairman of V Ltd, which provoked a further letter from H which was also published in the newspaper. S, G and V Ltd brought an action against the owners of the newspaper for libel. The plaintiffs in the statement of claim attributed several defamatory meanings to the words complained of and the defendants raised the defence of fair comment. The case was tried before a judge without a jury. The trial judge found that the words bore a defamatory meaning which was somewhat different from that pleaded by the plaintiffs and awarded substantial damages to them. The defendants appealed. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge on the defamatory meaning of the words as found by him and held that the defence of fair comment succeeded. The three judges of the Court of Appeal, Lord Denning MR, Diplock LJ and Salmond LJ, each expressed different opinions as to what, in respect of the defamatory meaning of the words complained of, the plaintiff was required to plead and what he could contend at the trial. Lord Denning MR said at pp 168-169: 
I think that, when a plaintiff complains of the words in their natural and ordinary meaning, he must accept that meaning as it is with all the derogatory imputations that it conveys. He cannot select some of the imputations and reject others as he pleases. The reason is because, when he complains of libel, he complains of the injury which the words do to his reputation in the minds of the ordinary reader. Now the ordinary reader takes the imputations as a whole. He does not divide them up into bits. Nor should the plaintiff be able to do so When the defendant comes to plead his defence, he cannot select some of the imputations and reject others. If he justifies, he pleads in the customary form: `The said words in their natural and ordinary meaning were true in substance and in fact` without specifying any particular imputations.
 Diplock LJ said at p 175: 
The plaintiffs, as they were entitled to do, chose to set out in their statement of claim the particular defamatory meaning which they contended was the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. Where this manner of pleading is adopted, the defamatory meaning so averred is treated at the trial as the most injurious meaning which the words are capable of bearing, and the plaintiff is, in effect, estopped from contending that the words do bear a more injurious meaning and claiming damages on that basis. But the averment does not of itself prevent the plaintiff from contending at the trial that even if the words do not bear the defamatory meaning alleged in the statement of claim to be the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, they nevertheless bear some other meaning less injurious to the plaintiff`s reputation but still defamatory of him, nor does it relieve the adjudicator of the duty of determining what is the right natural and ordinary meaning of the words, though nice questions may arise as to whether one meaning is more or less injurious than another.
 Salmond LJ expressed a tentative conclusion at p 185: 
Without committing myself to any concluded view, I am inclined to think that the plaintiff is bound by his pleading - otherwise it may prove to be nothing but a snare for the defendant. I do not mean, of course, that the plaintiff is strictly confined to the very shade or nuance of meaning which he has pleaded - but what he sets up at the trial must come broadly within the meaning he has pleaded. Nor do I think that, without any amendment of his statement of claim, it would be permissible for him to set up any entirely different meaning, even if it were less injurious to the plaintiff than the meaning pleaded. It is often difficult to decide which of two defamatory meanings is the more injurious. If there were a jury, how and by whom would the question be decided? Moreover, even if one meaning were somewhat less injurious than another, it might still be very injurious indeed, and the defendant might have had no real chance of preparing his defence to meet it. After all, there may be many opinions as to what inference words bear. It would be unfair to expect the defendant to guess which meaning or meanings the plaintiff intends to attribute to them. He might guess wrong and thus not only waste a great deal of time and money in raising a defence of justification or fair comment which would prove to be wholly irrelevant at the trial but he might also come to court wholly unprepared to meet the actual case sought to be made against him. Moreover, if the plaintiff relies on two different defamatory meanings, the defendant might wish to justify the one but not the other, and this, in my view, he is entitled to do.
 42.In the recent case of 
 Skuse v Granada Television Ltd 
 (supra) the Court of Appeal in England accepted Diplock LJ`s view and said at p 286: 
(6) In determining the meaning of the material complained of the court is `not limited by the meanings which either the plaintiff or the defendant seeks to place upon the words` ( 
Lucas-Box v News Group Newspaper Ltd
 
[1986] 1 WLR 147
 at p 152H). 
(7) The defamatory meaning pleaded by a plaintiff is to be treated as the most injurious meaning the words are capable of bearing and the questions a judge sitting alone has to ask himself are, first, is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words that which is alleged in the statement of claim, and, secondly, if not, what (if any) less injurious defamatory meaning do they bear? (
 Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd 
, above, at p 176.)
 43.Turning to the position in Singapore, this court has accepted that it is usual for the plaintiff to plead the highest defamatory meaning of the words complained of and the court may find a lesser defamatory meaning than that pleaded by the plaintiff and in such an event the claim may still succeed, unless there is some valid defence to the claim: 
Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew
 [1992] SLR 310 , pp 320-321 where the court said: 
We now turn to consider whether the words complained of bore the meaning as contended on behalf of the appellant or that as contended on behalf of the respondent or some other meaning. In this connection, we agree with Mr Gray`s contention that the learned judge, with respect, was in error when he said, at p 329:
 
`If the speech complained of does not bear the meaning asserted by the plaintiff in his statement of claim his claims must completely fail and the other issues raised in this trial would not require any further consideration. On the other hand, if the speech bears the meaning as claimed by the plaintiff, it is abundantly clear that applying the test of Lord Atkin set out in 
 Sim v Stretch
 [[1936] 2 All ER 1237] at p 1240 it will be defamatory of the plaintiff.`
 
It is usual for a plaintiff in a defamation action to plead the highest defamatory meaning of the words complained of and the court may well find a lesser defamatory meaning that than pleaded by the plaintiff. If such lesser defamatory meaning is found, the plaintiff`s claim will still succeed, unless there is some valid defence to the claim.
 This court, in effect, adopted Diplock LJ`s view, although the case of 
 Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd 
 (supra) was not expressly referred to in the judgment.
 44.It may be argued, as it appears to be so argued from the case of Mr Jeyaretnam, that what we have decided in 
 Jeyaretnam v Lee Kuan Yew 
 and also what the Court of Appeal has decided in 
 Skuse 
 applies only to a case where the plaintiff relies on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of and has no application where the plaintiff relies on the innuendo meaning. In other words, in the latter case the plaintiff must plead and prove the innuendo meaning - he is pinned to his innuendo meaning - and if a lesser meaning is established his claim must fail and it is not open to the court to find such lesser meaning. To our mind such a distinction is illogical and untenable and also is not warranted by any authority - certainly no authority has been cited to us. There is no reason in principle for such a distinction to be made. The law of defamation is concerned with the meanings of the words conveyed to the ordinary man and ascribes two types of meanings to the words: (i) the natural and ordinary meaning, and (ii) the innuendo meaning. In both cases, the meaning is that as understood by the ordinary man: in the case of the ordinary meaning such meaning is derived from the words themselves, read or heard in their proper context and in the circumstances in which they were said; and in the case of the innuendo meaning such meaning is arrived at with the aid of extrinsic facts known to the ordinary man. In both cases, the meaning has to be pleaded and particulars of the matters relied on also have to be pleaded and in the case of an innuendo meaning such matters include the extrinsic facts relied on, and these extrinsic facts must be proved and it must also be proved that the ordinary man is cognizant of these facts. In both cases, the court has to find and determine the meaning of the words complained of, whether it be the natural and ordinary meaning or the innuendo meaning or both and is entitled to find a lesser meaning than that pleaded. In defamation, as in other torts, the extent of the injury sustained by the plaintiff is a question for the court to decide and is not dependent solely on what the parties have pleaded. The extent of the injury depends, inter alia, on how injurious the meaning of the offending words is, and this is a question which the court has to decide.
 45.For completeness we should also refer to the case of 
National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd v GTV Corp Pty Ltd & Ors
 
[1989] VR 747
 where the Full Court of the State of Victoria said at p 768: 
Apparently the profession and the bench grew to approve of the practice as useful in informing the judge - and perhaps the defendant - of the real complaint of the plaintiff, especially in a case where no precise defamatory meaning was immediately apparent. Defendants were said to be saved from `trial by ambush`. But the practice did not, and in our opinion could not, alter the position at law that the meaning of the words was ultimately a question for the jury, and that the jury must be at large in finding the true meaning amongst such possible meanings as were left to them by the judge, and that the judge was not bound to confine the jury to the false innuendos asserted by the plaintiff.
 That passage must, of course, be understood in the context of the manner in which the action was tried, namely before a judge with a jury. In our jurisdiction, where the action is tried before a judge without a jury, as in all other cases, the meaning of the words complained of as defamatory of the plaintiff is not `at large`. The trial judge in determining the true meaning of the words must have regard, inter alia, to the pleadings before him and apply the tests for determining the right meaning as laid down by case law.
 46.We are not saying that the plaintiff is not bound by the meaning of the offending words he has pleaded, whether it be the natural and ordinary meaning or the innuendo meaning. Certainly he is bound by the pleadings, like in all other cases. But the court in deciding the right meaning the words convey to the ordinary man may determine, and is entitled to determine, a meaning less defamatory than that pleaded by the plaintiff. Of course, the court cannot determine a meaning more defamatory than that pleaded by the plaintiff, as that would be giving to the plaintiff more than what he has asked for. Nor are we saying that the plaintiff is at liberty to plead a very high defamatory meaning, which is strained and unnatural and is totally unwarranted by the offending words, and then at the trial contend a lesser defamatory meaning and ask the court to find that lesser meaning. In such case, the court may well compel him to amend his pleadings and allow the defendant an opportunity to consider whether he has a defence of justification for the lesser meaning and condemn the plaintiff in costs. Further, where the plaintiff has pleaded such a high defamatory meaning and refuses to amend his pleadings but steadfastly stands by that meaning, as in the case of 
 Prichard v Krantz 
 (supra), the court may well hold that he is pinned precisely to the meaning he has pleaded and rule that the words are incapable of such meaning and dismiss the claim. All these are matters within the jurisdiction of the trial judge who is in full control of the proceedings, and much depends on the circumstances of the case.
 47.Before we depart from this issue we should add a further word on 
 Truth (NZ) v Holloway 
 (supra). It seems to us that the rationale for Lord Denning`s view that the plaintiff is pinned to his pleaded meaning - be it the natural and ordinary meaning or the innuendo meaning - no longer applies at present. That case was decided in 1960 and it appeared that the rule of practice there was that the defendant could not plead that the words complained of bore a lesser meaning than that pleaded by the plaintiff and then seek to justify that meaning. Thus it was said that, unless the plaintiff is pinned to the meaning that he has pleaded, it would be impossible for the defendant to decide how to justify the alleged defamatory words. However, since the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in 
Lucas-Box v News Group Newspapers Ltd
 
[1986] 1 WLR 147
 the law governing the practice of pleading the defence of justification has changed. It was there held, inter alia, that the defendant in pleading justification has to plead the meaning he seeks to justify. 
 Lucas-Box 
 has been considered, clarified and applied in subsequent cases: see 
Polly Peck v Trelford, Viscount De L`Isle v Times Newspapers Ltd
 
[1988] 1 WLR 49
, 
Prager v Times Newspapers Ltd
 
[1988] 1 WLR 77
, and 
Morrell v International Thomson Publishing Ltd & Ors
 
[1989] 3 All ER 733
, and was followed by the High Court in Singapore in 
Lee Kuan Yew v Derek Gwyn Davies & Ors
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 390
  
[1989] SLR 1063
 , and was also applied by this court in 
Aaron v Cheong Yip Seng
 
[1996] 1 SLR 623
 . The position was summed up by May LJ in 
 Morrell 
 at pp 737-738: 
In any event I think the position now is that a defendant who pleads justification must do so in such a way as quite clearly, without circumlocution or obfuscation, to inform the plaintiff and the court of precisely what meaning or meanings the defendant may seek to justify. Although this may be done in the particulars of justification, there is then a substantial risk that the precise meaning will be lost in words. I see no reason why the meaning or meanings should not be set out directly, briefly and at the start of the plea.
 48.
 Adoption of Mr Tang`s words
Now, we briefly turn our attention to Mr Gray`s argument that, on 
Astaire v Campling & Anor
 
[1965] 2 All ER 666
 and 
Ramaiah Naragatha Vally & Ors v Singapore Press Holdings Ltd & Anor
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 497
 , Mr Jeyaretnam could not be made liable for the words spoken by Mr Tang in the absence of some clear reference adopting, importing or citing those words.
 49.Both cases were cited in the judgment of the court below. In 
 Astaire v Campling 
, the plaintiff attempted to prove his case against the defendant newspaper in respect of a defamatory newspaper report which referred to a `Mr X` (whom he alleged was himself). He argued that it would be known to the reader that he was `Mr X` and produced reports from other newspapers to show this. Sellers LJ found that the plaintiff could not rely on the statements of other persons to prove his claim against the defendants unless the defendants had adopted those statements. In 
 Ramaiah v Singapore Press Holdings 
, the publisher of the 
 Straits Times 
 was sued in respect of an article narrating the facts relating to a gruesome murder, and stating that the four plaintiffs had been arrested and charged for the crime but were subsequently released for lack of evidence. On the same page, but in a different article, a television executive had been interviewed in relation to a television series being produced based on the murder. The television executive made no reference to the plaintiffs. He successfully applied to strike out the action brought by the plaintiffs. Goh Joon Seng J, applying 
 Astaire v Campling 
, held that, as he was not responsible for the article which referred to the plaintiffs, and had neither adopted or repeated the facts contained therein in his statements, he was not liable in defamation.
 50.The argument put before us was that the defamatory nature of the words arose not so much out of the words `And finally, Mr Tang Liang Hong has just placed before me two reports he has made to the police against, you know, Mr Goh Chok Tong and his people`, but out of Mr Tang`s published threats to sue the Prime Minister and to `lodge a police report against [him] for criminal offence`. It is therefore argued that unless Mr Jeyaretnam had adopted Mr Tang`s allegation that the Prime Minister was guilty of a criminal offence, then, on 
 Astaire v Campling 
, he could not be liable for them. We are unable to agree. The present case is not concerned with whether or not Mr Jeyaretnam repeated Mr Tang`s statements. Nor was he sued for the allegations made by Mr Tang. What he was sued for was the announcement he made and the implication arising from his announcement that Mr Tang had filed police reports against Mr Goh. The only question was whether that statement was defamatory and we have held that it was, both in the ordinary sense and by the innuendo we have discussed.
 51.
 Damages
We now turn to the issue of damages. Before we proceed further, we should say a word on the separate awards for general compensatory damages and aggravated damages made by the trial judge. It is well-established that aggravated damages in defamation represent merely a component of the compensatory damages and aggravated damages are awarded when the defendant`s conduct before and during trial has aggravated the hurt to the plaintiff`s feelings. For such conduct, the quantum of damages payable in respect of the defamatory publication may be enhanced to compensate adequately the plaintiff for the injury occasioned. Reverting to the present case, the trial judge should have awarded a single global sum compensating the plaintiff for the collective actions of the defendant, from the date of publication to the end of the trial. This is the approach which we explored and applied in the Tang appeal, and in our judgment is the right approach. It is relevant to bear in mind the following passage from the speech of Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC in 
Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome & Anor
 
[1972] AC 1027
, p 1072: 
it has always been a principle of English law that the award of damages when awarded must be a single lump sum in respect of each separate cause of action I must say I view with some distrust the arbitrary subdivision of different elements of general damages for the same tort as was done in 
Loudon v Ryder
 
[1953] 2 QB 202
, and even, subject to what I say later, what was expressly approved by Lord Devlin in 
Rookes v Barnard
 
[1964] AC 1129
, 1228 for the laudable purpose of avoiding a new trial. In cases where the award of general damages contains a subjective element, I do not believe it is desirable or even possible simply to add separate sums together for different parts of the subjective element, especially where, as was done by agreement in this case, the subjective element relates under different heads to the same factor, in this case the bad conduct of the defendant.
 We therefore do not commend to our courts the practice of separating an award for aggravated damages from the award of general compensatory damages. The courts should award one single lump sum as damages.
 52.It is contended by Mr Davinder Singh that the trial judge failed to direct his mind to all the relevant factors. This criticism is not justified. It is quite clear to us that the trial judge took pains to examine every possible factor relevant to the issue of damages. In that respect, he did not err. Where we think the trial judge did err, however, was in three principal areas. First, he erred in his finding that there was no express malice on the part of Mr Jeyaretnam. Secondly, he failed to give sufficient weight to some of the relevant aggravating factors. Thirdly, the award of $20,000 is totally disconsonant with precedent cases.
 53.We are of the view that the trial judge`s finding that the defendant did not act in malice, but only recklessly, was in error. Mr Davinder Singh submits, on the authority of
 Horrocks v Low 
e 
[1975] AC 135
, p 150 that if the trial judge had found, as he did, that Mr Jeyaretnam had made his statement `recklessly, without considering or caring whether it be true or not`, then he is `treated as if he knew it to be false` and accordingly acted in malice. We agree. The trial judge found at [para ] 164: 
The defendant was also reckless in making the assertions he did in that he did not attempt to verify whether or not what was said of Mr Tang were true - he acted on his own belief and opinion in a matter of considerable public interest. He stated in cross-examination: 
`Mr Shields: did you make any attempts yourself to find out whether they were telling the truth - to look at the material which would support their assertion and their attacks upon Mr Tang? 
Defendant: No. 
Mr Shields: So it`s only on your own knowledge of Mr Tang that you took the view that the plaintiffs were lying about him in attacking him? 
Defendant: Yes I sort of gathered they were sort of basing it on what had happened in the past.`
 Accordingly, having made this finding, he ought to have concluded that Mr Jeyaretnam acted in malice.
 54.The statement was a cleverly disguised sting, directed at Mr Goh, and was intended by Mr Jeyaretnam to cast a stain on Mr Goh`s reputation in the hope that it might enhance his (Mr Jeyaretnam`s) chances at election the next day. He must have been aware of the presence of news journalists in the audience, as they had been present at rallies throughout the election campaign. It is therefore beyond credulity that he did not intend the republication of his comments, or that he was unaware that such a consequence would follow from his announcement.
 55.Secondly, on the matter of aggravated damages, Mr Davinder Singh submits that the trial judge did not have sufficient regard to the aggravating factors arising out of the trial and in particular the conduct of Mr Jeyaretnam`s counsel in cross-examining Mr Goh. We admit that we find ourselves at a loss to understand the trial judge`s preoccupation with the fact that Mr Shields, who represented Mr Goh in the court below, had failed to object more vigorously to the line of questioning of Mr Goh adopted by Mr Carman representing Mr Jeyaretnam. It seems to us to be of no relevance that Mr Shields did not do more to protect his client from the offensive suggestions made by Mr Carman - exercising control over how a counsel conducts his case is a function of the judge, not the opposing counsel. Insofar as this was a basis on which the trial judge adjudicated the extent of aggravation caused by Mr Carman`s cross-examination, we think he erred.
 56.However, we think that the trial judge was correct when he identified that Mr Carman had put his case with the driving force of a strong one and then failed to call any evidence to support it. The trial judge found that this was `to indulge in pure rhetoric` and to make `an attack on the integrity of the plaintiff as Prime Minister`. Having reviewed the notes of evidence, we also agree that, in doing so, Mr Carman was only playing to the gallery, and not attempting to elicit evidence relevant to the issues before the court. There is no doubt in our minds that the wide range of accusations he made against Mr Goh on the stand amounted to an attack on his integrity, character and suitability for his position as Prime Minister of Singapore. Not only that, but, as the trial judge found, they amounted to a baseless attack, which, we think, aggravated the hurt caused to Mr Goh, for which he is entitled to compensation.
 57.Lastly, notwithstanding that the trial judge correctly identified that each defamation case must be taken on its own facts, we are of the view that insufficient regard was paid to the precedents established in case law. A broad framework of awards has emerged from past cases and these cases serve as a guide in determining the appropriate amount of damages to be awarded. In this respect, the awards made in cases preceding this appeal must be treated with care: they are not necessarily accurate indications of appropriate awards of damages. Even so, given our findings on the issue of malice and the gravity of the aggravating factors, together with the extent of republication and the high standing of Mr Goh, the global award of $20,000 appears to us totally disconsonant with those awards, including those which might now be considered excessive.
 58.In particular, we note that an opposition Member of Parliament, Mr Chiam See Tong, received awards of $50,000 in 
Chiam See Tong v Xin Zhang Jiang Restaurant Pte Ltd
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 196
  in respect of the publication of his photograph in the restaurant`s advertising material and $120,000 in 
Chiam See Tong v Ling How Doong & Ors
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 648
  in respect of accusations made by his former political allies that he had become a government stooge. We are mindful of the differences between these two cases and the present one. Nonetheless, they are of some relevance in this respect showing a broad framework of the awards made.
 59.In light of what we have said, we think that the quantum of damages arrived at below must be reconsidered and the amount of damages must undergo an upward revision. In all the circumstances, we are of the opinion that a fair and reasonable sum to be awarded to Mr Goh as damages should be $100,000. Accordingly, we increase the award of $20,000 to $100,000.
 60.
 Costs
We now come to the question of costs. The trial judge in exercise of his discretion deprived Mr Goh of 40% of the costs and it is contended by Mr Davinder Singh that he had exercised his discretion wrongly. Costs are entirely at the discretion of the court, but the discretion has to be exercised judicially. It is settled law that an appellate court may interfere with a judge`s exercise of his discretion, if he has erred in law or in principle or he has taken into account some matter which he should not have taken into account or has omitted to take into account some matter which he should have taken into account, or if the appellate court is of the opinion that the judge`s decision is plainly wrong and therefore must have been reached by a faulty assessment of the weight of the various factors which he has had to take into account: per Stephenson LJ in 
Alltrans Express Ltd v CVA Holdings Ltd
 
[1984] 1 WLR 394
, p 400. The established practice as to the exercise of the discretion to award costs, includes the following principles: (a). that costs should follow the event, except when it appears to the court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made;
 (b). that the general rule does not cease to apply simply because the successful party raises issues or makes allegations on which he fails, but where that has caused a significant increase in the length or costs of the proceedings he may be deprived of the whole or part of his costs: 
Re Elgindata Ltd (No 2)
 
[1992] 1 WLR 1207
, per Nourse LJ at p 1214A-B (cited with approval in 
Tullio v Maoro
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 489
 , and the judgment on costs in the Tang appeal).
 61.Having stated these principles we now turn to consider the decision of the trial judge on costs. He said at [para ] 208-209: 
208 The normal rule on costs is that costs will be awarded to the successful party. In this case, although the plaintiff has been successful in the sense that an award for damages in his favour has been made, the plaintiff did not succeed in his claim as pleaded in his statement of claim. Bearing in mind the significant disparity between the meaning of the words as claimed by the plaintiff and the meaning of the words as I have found them to be, the question arises whether the plaintiff should be awarded the full costs. 
209 I am conscious that it is not appropriate to deprive the Plaintiff of costs simply because he did not succeed on all the issues. In 
Re Elgindata Ltd (No 2)
 
[1993] 1 All ER 232
, the trial judge ordered the respondents to pay only one quarter of the costs of a successful petitioner under the English equivalent of our s 216 of the Companies Act (Ch 50) Because the plaintiff has succeeded in this suit he is entitled to costs. However, I am mindful that a great deal of time was spent trying to prove pleadings that were at the end of the day not established: the high pleaded meaning of the words, the allegation of malice on the part of the defendant and the allegations concerning his intention and purpose in making the statement, the allegation of conspiracy between the defendant and Mr Tang, the allegation that the defendant had adopted Mr Tang`s words and the inaccuracies between the pleadings and the videotape are examples. These should affect the extent of his entitlement to costs. Naturally, the counterbalancing factor is the extent to which Mr Carman`s cross-examination of the defendant dwelt on irrelevant matters.
 62.We agree that there is a disparity between the meaning pleaded and the meanings found by the trial judge. But the fact remains that Mr Goh succeeded on the fundamental issue, ie that the words complained of were defamatory of him. We do not think that there was any significant amount of time that could have been wasted by reason of this disparity. Two types of meaning were ascribed to the offending words: the natural and ordinary meaning and the innuendo meaning. The determination of the natural and ordinary meaning turned on the words themselves, heard or read in their proper context, and no extrinsic evidence is admissible to determine this meaning. It is essentially a matter of argument as to what the ordinary man would consider as the true meaning of the words. As for the innuendo meaning, Mr Goh relied on extrinsic facts which the trial judge found had been proved; the trial judge also found that these facts were known to the ordinary man. These findings were made in Mr Goh`s favour. Again, it is essentially a matter of argument as to what the ordinary man equipped with the knowledge of these facts would consider to be the true meaning of the words. In both cases, it is the level of the meanings in issue and we would have thought that whichever be the level of the meaning the trial judge was persuaded to accept - whether the pleaded meaning or other meaning - the same amount of time would have been taken up.
 63.It is true that the trial judge was right in his finding that the allegations of conspiracy between Mr Tang and Mr Jeyaretnam and of Mr Jeyaretnam`s adoption of Mr Tang`s words were not made good by Mr Goh. On the other side of the coin, there were the unsuccessful contentions made on behalf of Mr Jeyaretnam that he was not liable for the republication in the newspapers and that he was not liable for the reference to the police reports as he was merely passing on what Mr Tang had instructed him to say. There was also one other factor, namely the amount of time wasted by Mr Carman in cross-examining Mr Goh on irrelevant matters. As for the express malice which was also referred to by the trial judge in his reasoning on the question of costs we have found that he had erred and that there was express malice on the part of Mr Jeyaretnam.
 64.Having regard to the above we are of the opinion that the trial judge was not justified in reducing the costs of Mr Goh by 40%. We accordingly set aside the order below on costs.
 65.We allow CA 205/97 with costs here and below. We dismiss CA 218/97 with costs. In respect of the costs of the two appeals, only one set of costs is allowed. We are not disposed to make an order for the issue of a certificate of two solicitors under O 59 r 19 of the Rules of Court. There will be the usual order for the refund to Mr Goh or his solicitors of the deposit in court as security for costs in CA 205/97 and payment to Mr Goh or his solicitors of the deposit in court as security for costs in CA 218/97.",1998-07-17 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Cur Adv Vult
The appellant was tried and convicted of the following amended charge: 
DAC 13213/97
 
You, Roy Selvarajah (M/1/3/61) SNRIC (P) S 1467915D are charged that you, between 8 January 1995 and 21 May 1997, in Singapore, did abet to wit by intentionally aiding one Meyyanathan Nagammal (F/12/4/59), an Indian national, in the commission of an offence of remaining in Singapore unlawfully after the expiry of the visit pass on 7 January 1995, which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby abetted an offence under s 15(1) Immigration Act (Cap 133) which is punishable under s 15(3)(b) of the said Act read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 2.He was sentenced to six months` imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane. He was also charged with harbouring the same foreigner in DAC 13214/97 but was acquitted of that charge. The appellant has appealed against the conviction and sentence in respect of the abetment charge. The prosecution is not appealing in respect of the harbouring charge.
 3.
 The prosecution`s case
The prosecution`s case was essentially that Meyyanathan Nagammal (PW10) remained in Singapore unlawfully for a period of two years after the expiry of her social visit pass on 7 January 1995, in contravention of s 15(1) Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Ed), and that the appellant had abetted her to commit the offence by intentionally aiding her. At the trial below, the prosecution called a total of twenty witnesses. PW1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 13 gave evidence in respect of the abetment charge. PW10 was originally tried jointly with the appellant. At the commencement of the trial, the prosecution applied to stand down the charge of overstaying under s 15(1) of the Immigration Act against PW10. Instead it proceeded with the two amended charges against the appellant and turned PW10 into a material prosecution witness against the appellant.
 4.There was no dispute that PW10, the alleged overstayer, was sponsored by the appellant to enter into Singapore to work as a domestic maid. PW10 entered Singapore on 24 December 1994 and was given a 14-day social visit pass which expired on 7 January 1995. It was also not disputed that the appellant had, prior to her arrival, applied for in-principle approval from the Work Permit Department for her to work in Singapore, which was granted on 2 December 1994. The in-principle approval was a pre-requisite for PW10 to enter Singapore for the purpose of employment and the approval was only valid for three months.
 5.The prosecution led evidence by M Thevarani (PW1) and Sandor Wong (PW2) to show that PW10 was an illegal overstayer. PW1 was an investigating officer in the case attached to the Immigration Field Division, Investigation Department. Her investigations revealed that PW10 entered Singapore on 24 December 1994 and was granted a 14-day social visit pass. Her checks with the Data Processing Centre in Immigration Department showed that PW10 did not extend her social visit pass. She also testified that, based on a letter from the Work Permit Department dated 16 October 1997 (exh P4), the in-principle approval granted to PW10 was cancelled when PW10 did not turn up to collect her work permit.
 6.PW2 was a representative from the Ministry of Labour. PW2 explained the procedure that was applicable if an employer wished to employ a foreign domestic maid in Singapore. First, the employer was required to apply for a work permit for the maid. If Ministry of Labour approved the application, it would send an in-principle approval letter to the employer. The employer would then be required to execute a security bond and undertake a banker`s or insurance guarantee to support the bond. Once these procedures were complied with, Ministry of Labour would make an endorsement on the in-principle approval letter. It was only with such a letter that the maid would be granted entry into Singapore. The in-principle approval was valid for three months. After the worker had arrived in Singapore, the employer was required to submit the worker`s passport, in-principle approval letter, her medical report and other immigration forms to the Work Permit Department within 14 days of her arrival. If the employer failed to follow up on these procedures within the three-month period, the Work Permit Department would assume that the worker did not arrive in Singapore. It would then send a cancellation letter to the employer within one month of the expiry of the in- principle approval, stating that the in-principle approval had been cancelled. In the same letter, the Work Permit Department would also inform the employer to return the in-principle approval letter so that they could discharge the security bond.
 7.In her evidence-in-chief, PW2 relied on exh P4 and confirmed that in-principle approval was issued to M Thavamalar (PW5), for the purpose of employing PW10, and it was subsequently cancelled on 1 April 1995 when PW10 did not turn up to collect her work-permit. PW2 testified that the file on PW10 had been destroyed and all the information was obtained from the computer database. Subsequently, when PW2 was recalled on the stand, he stated that the record in the database showed that a letter, informing the employer of the cancellation of the in-principle approval, was sent out on 1 April 1995. During the course of the testimony of PW1 and PW2, counsel for the appellant raised no objection to the admissibility of exh P4 or the evidence relating to P4. In his closing submission, however, he argued that P4 was inadmissible as hearsay and the evidence on PW10`s overstaying given by PW1 and PW2 was hearsay and inadmissible. The district judge held that P4 was inadmissible hearsay but ruled that the evidence of PW1 and PW2 was admissible.
 8.
 PW3
Kalichivi d/o Admoolam (PW3) was the appellant`s neighbour. She testified that the appellant was her employment agent who arranged for a new maid for her. PW3 was supposed to meet her new maid at the airport and the appellant requested her to fetch PW10 from the airport at the same time. PW3 met PW10 at the airport where the latter handed over her passport and visa to her. PW3 then brought PW10 to her house where the appellant later came to fetch PW10. PW3 handed over PW10`s passport and visa to the appellant. She did not have anything to do with PW10 or the appellant after that.
 9.
 PW4 and 5
Murugamoorthy s/o Ponnambalam Balasingham (PW4) and PW5 were husband and wife. There was no dispute that the Ministry of Labour had given in-principle approval to PW5 to employ PW10 as her domestic maid, and that the appellant was his employment agent who handled all the documentation in respect of PW10 on their behalf. PW4 testified that the appellant brought PW10 to his mother`s place where she worked for a period of two weeks. According to PW5 this was from the end of December 1994 to the beginning of January 1995. The appellant did not hand PW10`s passport to PW4 and he presumed that the passport was still with the appellant to complete the necessary documentation. After two weeks, PW4 called the appellant, expressing his dissatisfaction with PW10, and asked him to take her away. The appellant then came and took PW10 away.
 10.
 PW6 and 11
Varatharajullu s/o Thiruvengadom (PW6) and Kelyani Sinnakkalani Ramasamy (PW11) were husband and wife. PW11 had known the appellant since 1990. PW6 testified that the appellant was his employment agent and PW10 was the second maid which the appellant had supplied to PW6. PW6 said that PW10 worked for them for less than a month as a temporary maid until their proper maid arrived. PW6 said that she was unsure if PW10 had a work permit as she left the entire matter to the appellant. The appellant did not show PW10`s passport to PW6. PW6 also said that they did not pay any foreign worker`s levy in respect of PW10. PW11 paid PW10 her salary personally.
 11.PW11 confirmed that the appellant supplied PW10 to her household. Although PW6 said that PW10 only worked for them for less than a month, PW11 testified that PW10 worked for them for about two and a half to three months, starting from the end of March or early April 1995. She also confirmed that they had applied for another maid but the appellant brought PW10 to their house and told them to keep PW10 until their proper maid arrived. PW11 said that she did not pay the appellant for PW10. She said that it was PW6 who dealt with the appellant. She confirmed that she paid three months` salary to PW10 at $250 for each month. Out of this, $500 was given to the appellant.
 12.PW11 said that she did not know whether PW10 had any work permit as PW6 handled the documentation. She had also not seen PW10`s passport. Each time she asked PW10 for her passport, PW10 would say that it was with the appellant. PW11 became suspicious when there was no Giro deduction made for PW10`s foreign worker`s levy. On 5 June 1990 she started to question PW10 who became emotional and attempted suicide. PW6 and 11 then asked the appellant to take away PW10. The appellant did so accordingly. The couple did not question the appellant about PW10`s work permit in view of the tantrum thrown by PW10.
 13.
 PW9
Raju Krishnaveni (PW9) was a friend of the appellant and she had known the appellant for 15 years as an old friend. She testified that the appellant had arranged two maids to work for her, one of whom was PW10. PW9 said that the appellant introduced PW10 to her. PW10 worked for PW9 for about one and a half months between May and June 1995. At the time when the appellant brought PW10 to PW9`s house, PW9 asked the appellant whether all the documents were in order and the appellant assured her that everything was in order. PW10 also told PW9 that the appellant was keeping her passport. After one and a half months, PW9 decided to send PW10 back to the appellant when she found PW10 to be unsatisfactory. She tried to page and contact the appellant but was not able to get in touch with him. Finally she called his home and told one of his family members to fetch PW10 from the temple. She then left PW10 at the temple.
 14.
 PW7
Thanesh s/o Vallipuram (PW7) testified that PW10 worked for him as a maid for 15 months roughly from the middle of 1995 to early February or March 1997. He testified that PW10 was supplied by the appellant. PW7 asked PW10 if she was in possession of a valid work permit and she claimed that she had one but it was with the appellant. The appellant also told PW7 that he had PW10`s work permit and passport. PW7 also confirmed that during the period when PW10 worked for him, he did not pay any foreign worker`s levy.
 15.
 PW13
Arumugam Kalyrani (PW13) testified that her sister who, at the time of the trial was in the United States, had employed PW10 as a maid from around December 1996 or January 1997 to 14 February 1997. At that time PW13 was moving house and required PW10 to help her.
 16.
 PW14
P Suntharambal (PW14) was a machine operator. She first met PW10 at PW13`s house. After that PW10 would call her once a week. In the middle of 1997, PW10 stayed at PW14`s house for three or four days. She told PW14 that she had no place to stay. PW10 also said that, if PW14 could allow her to stay for a while, she would call her agent, the appellant, who would then come and take her away. PW10 paged for the appellant who came to PW14`s house and told PW14 that he would take PW10 with him the next day. The next day, someone else who introduced himself as the appellant`s brother-in-law came to fetch PW10.
 17.
 PW16
P Lakshmanan (PW16) testified that he and his wife used to stay at Telok Blangah Heights. PW10 was then working at their neighbour`s house. He said that PW10 used to visit him and his wife. Even when PW10 left to work somewhere else, she continued to call his wife. PW10 told him and his wife that she wanted to go back to India, but could not do so because her passport was with the appellant. His wife then tried to get the passport from the appellant. When they could not get the passport, PW10 decided to surrender herself to the police in order to get her passport back. He then brought PW10 to the police station where he told the police of her predicament.
 18.
 PW12
PW12 testified that he met PW10 through Guntur Suryadinata (PW7). PW7 had asked him to send him and PW10 to the appellant`s house. Subsequently the appellant asked him to bring PW10 to Outram Park. He said that he had given two statements to the Immigration Department. In the first statement, he stated that he had not seen PW10`s passport. Before he gave his second statement, he accompanied PW1 and the prosecutor to the prison to visit PW10. During the visit, PW10 said that PW12 had seen her passport. The prosecutor told PW12 that if he did not admit this, he would not let him off until he got to the bottom of the case. PW12 then told the learned prosecutor that he would give PW10 the benefit of the doubt. When they returned to the Immigration Office, he gave his second statement in which he stated that he had seen PW10`s passport. PW12 testified in court that in fact he had not seen PW10`s passport. He clarified that he had not been to Ruby Plaza and he only helped PW10 to carry her bags from the appellant`s house to Outram Park. He did not know that she was an overstayer.
 19.
 PW10
PW10 was the chief witness for the prosecution. She testified that she came to Singapore in December 1994 for the purpose of working as a domestic maid. She was met by PW3 at the airport and was then brought to her home. She gave her passport to PW3. Later that day, the appellant came to PW3`s house to fetch her. PW10 said that PW3 handed over her passport to the appellant. The appellant then brought her for a medical check up. Later he brought her to PW4`s house.
 20.PW10 testified that she worked for PW4 for a period of one month and ten days. During this period, she was working at PW4`s house and at his mother`s house. She was next brought to PW6`s house some time in February 1995. She was later taken to PW9`s house, where she stayed for one month and ten days. By that time she had been in Singapore for six months. She was then brought to PW7`s house where she stayed for 15 months.
 21.PW10 testified that she had repeatedly asked the appellant for her work permit when she was brought to various households. When she raised the matter with the appellant again when she was with PW7, the appellant told her that she had a valid work permit. She expressed her desire to return to India as her son had called her to say that he was not well. PW7 and PW12 then brought her to the appellant`s house where she stayed for two days. During the two days, she told the appellant that she wanted to go home and the appellant said that he would arrange for the air ticket. After the two days, the appellant brought her to a house in Thomson belonging to one Das. Das had since passed away on 18 December 1997.
 22.At the Das house, she again expressed her desire to return to India to both the appellant and Das. Das then sent her back to the appellant`s house. She next stayed with one Meena who stayed in Outram Park and with one Senkuttvan Malar, Meena`s daughter. She then stayed with one Punitha in her house in Hougang. The appellant subsequently brought her to PW13`s house at Jurong West to work as a domestic maid for a period for four and a half months. By then she had been in Singapore for more than two years. During the period of time when she left PW7`s household, she repeatedly asked the appellant to send her back to India and to return her passport.
 23.After she left PW13`s household, she went to stay with PW14 without the appellant`s knowledge for five days. On 25 April 1997, the appellant who was accompanied by PW12 brought her to apartment #08-03 at Ruby Plaza. On the way there, the appellant showed her her passport and it was the first time for more than two years that she saw her passport. She testified that PW12 saw the passport as well. She stayed at the apartment until 21 May 1997. She was very concerned as her son was not well and she feared that, if she had any valid work permit, it would have expired after two years. On 21 May 1997, she surrendered herself to the police.
 24.After she surrendered to the police, she was in remand. On 25 October 1997, an unknown person bailed her out. The unknown person and another stranger took her away by car and her unknown bailor then alighted. The other stranger bought her food and brought her to a room to stay and gave her some money. The following day, at about midnight, the same stranger brought her to another place to stay and gave her some more money. PW10 produced $3,910 in court. She said that out of this amount, $60 was her salary. The stranger gave the rest of the money to her on those two days, half the amount on the first day and the balance on the second day. The stranger also told her not to turn up in court. Nevertheless, she came to court.
 25.
 Prima facie case
At the end of the prosecution case, counsel for the defence submitted that there was no case to answer because the prosecution had not adduced evidence to support each and every essential ingredient of the charge which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction. His arguments were as follows: (1) the prosecution had not stated the particulars as to how the appellant had intentionally aided PW10, the principal offender in the charge; (2) the principal offender had not been convicted; (3) the principal offence had not been proved; and (4) there was no evidence that the principal offence was committed as a result of the appellant`s abetment. The district judge found that the prosecution had established a case for the defence to answer and accordingly called for the defence.
 26.
 The defence
The appellant was a freelance trader. His defence was that he had no knowledge that PW10 was an overstayer and hence there was no `intentional aiding` of the commission of the offence. He testified that he obtained her particulars from PW3 and arranged for her to work for PW4. He helped PW4 to apply for the in-principle approval to employ her as his maid and applied for an entry visa to enable her to leave India. He also arranged for a $5,000 security bond to be executed by PW4. The appellant sent her for a medical check-up, and then sent her to PW4`s household. After the 14-day period from her arrival, he applied for an extension of one month to regularise her documents, as her medical report was not ready.
 27.PW4 complained that PW10 was a poor worker and was untruthful. The appellant told PW4 that he could either transfer her to another employer or cancel her work permit and send her home. The appellant consulted PW10 but she refused to go back to India as she had incurred expenses in coming to Singapore. The appellant accordingly requested PW4 to sign the transfer papers for PW10. Meanwhile, he met a friend called Gunasekaran (Guna) who was also an employment agent. Guna told the appellant that he could obtain an employer for PW10. The appellant handed PW10 and the documents to Guna. During this one-month extension, he handed the documents to Guna together with the authorisation letter and consent from PW5 to transfer PW10. Since the appellant had handed all the documents to Guna, he took it that a work permit had been issued. Subsequently PW5 told him that the work permit had been cancelled. He could not, however, give the particulars of Guna and Guna was not called as a witness.
 28.The appellant admitted that he continued to have dealings with PW10 even after handling the documents to Guna. She used to call him regularly. Once PW7 and PW12 brought her to his house. He denied that the evidence given by the various employers was true. The appellant testified that after the two weeks with PW4 and PW5, she was then with Guna and working with an expatriate employer. Since PW5 had received the cancellation letter, he believed that the transfer had been effected correctly.
 29.The appellant claimed that there was one occasion in April 1997 when he brought her to Ruby Plaza. She had called him and told him that she had excessive baggage and she wanted to send it by cargo. She asked the appellant if he could help her keep the bags. The appellant agreed to store them at an apartment at Ruby Plaza where PW17, a friend of his, was staying. When the appellant fetched her to that apartment, he did not tell her that she could stay there. He gave her a key to the apartment only so that she could gain access to her things. The appellant denied that PW12 was in the car when he drove her to Ruby Plaza and he denied showing her her passport in the car while on the way to Ruby Plaza. He had nothing to do with her passport since he had handed it over to Guna.
 30.The appellant called one other witness, DW2, who was the son of the `Das` whom PW10 referred to in her evidence. DW2 testified that the Immigration Department questioned him about the employment of PW10. He told them that he did not know PW10 and that, as far as he knew, they did not employ her.
 31.
 The decision below
In closing submissions, counsel for the appellant objected for the first time to the admissibility of the evidence of PW1 and PW2 relating to PW10`s alleged overstay in Singapore, on the ground that it was objectionable hearsay. He argued that their evidence was based entirely upon exh P4, a document from the Controller of Work Permits, and it was inadmissible as hearsay since the maker of the document was not called to testify. This objection was rejected by the district judge and she found that the evidence of PW1 and PW2 were admissible to prove that PW10 was an illegal overstayer. She held that the charge for abetment was proved beyond reasonable doubt. She accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that it was the appellant who had knowingly supplied PW10 to the various households and disbelieved the appellant that he had no knowledge that she was an overstayer. She thought it was incredible that PW10 would devise a scheme with her former employers and friends to frame the appellant. She dismissed the allegations that the prosecutor had intimidated PW12 and other prosecution witnesses into lying when giving evidence.
 32.
 The appeal
The appellant`s counsel challenged the decision of the district judge in holding that the prosecution had made out a case for the defence to answer. In any event, he argued that the finding of guilt by the district judge was against the weight of evidence and that the conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory because the manner in which the prosecution had been conducted was prejudicial to the appellant. The issues raised in this appeal were: (1). whether the charge was defective because of the omission of material particulars of how the appellant had intentionally aided PW10 to overstay in Singapore;
 (2). whether the principal offence of overstaying under s 15(1) Immigration Act had been made out;
 (3). the consequences for not dealing with the principal offender;
 (4). whether the principal offence was committed as a result of the appellant`s alleged abetment;
 (5). whether the conviction was supportable by the evidence; and
 (6). whether the manner in which the trial was conducted was prejudicial to the appellant.
 (1) Prosecution`s failure to state material particulars of how the appellant had intentionally aided PW10 to overstay
 33.Section 15(1) Immigration Act states that: 
A person shall not remain in Singapore after the cancellation of any permit or certificate, or after the making of a declaration under section 14(4) or after the expiration or notification to him, in such manner as may be prescribed, of the cancellation of any pass relating to or issued to him unless he is otherwise entitled or authorised to remain in Singapore under the provisions of this Act or the regulations.
 34.Section 107(c) Penal Code reads: 
A person abets the doing of a thing who - 
 
(c) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
 35.In respect of the charge under s 15(1) Immigration Act read with s 109 Penal Code, the prosecution was required to prove the following ingredients in the charge: (1) PW10 overstayed in Singapore for the period stated in the charge after the expiry of her social visit pass; (2) the appellant abetted her in overstaying in Singapore, in this case by intentionally aiding her; and (3) PW10 committed the offence of overstaying as a result of the appellant`s abetment.
 36.The appellant`s counsel argued that the charge was defective because it failed to provide any particulars of intentional aiding. This argument is really without merit. Section 160 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) provides that where the particulars provided in ss 158 and 159 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose. Section 158 requires the name of the offence to be set out and s 159 provides that the particulars of the time and place of the alleged offence have to be set out as well. In this case, there was sufficient information in the charge for the appellant to be put on notice as to the case against him. The name of the person whom the appellant was alleged to have intentionally aided, as well as the offence alleged to have been abetted, were all set out in the charge. There was no necessity for the prosecution to state in the charge how the appellant had intentionally aided PW10 to overstay in Singapore. It was sufficient for the prosecution to lead evidence, through its witnesses, of how he had intentionally aided PW10 to overstay.
 37.Counsel for the defence relied on 
Ong Ah Yeo Yenna v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 73
 , 
Lim Woon Cheng Anthony v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 14
  and 
Govindarajulu v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 838
 . However, in all these cases, as in the present case, the charges merely provided that the accused had intentionally aided the principal offender without specifying the particulars of how the intentional aid came about. No objection was taken to the charges, so they did not provide any support for counsel`s contentions. In 
 Ong Ah Yeo Yenna 
, the statement of facts to which the petitioner had pleaded guilty did not address the petitioner`s intention to aid the principal offender in committing the offence of criminal breach of trust. The High Court quashed the conviction, as the averment in the charge that she abetted by intentionally aiding the principal offender was not proved. The High Court did not hold that the charge was in any way defective.
 (2) Whether the principal offence of overstaying within s 15(1) Immigration Act was made out
 38.In 
 Ong Ah Yeo Yenna 
, the High Court held that the court which tries an abettor on a charge of intentional aiding of an offence must direct its mind towards making a finding as to whether or not the whole actus reus of the offence he is alleged to have aided is in fact committed; and the court must do so even where the principal has not been convicted of that offence by the time the alleged intentional aider is tried. The reason is that the accused cannot be said to have intentionally aided that offence unless the whole actus reus of the offence itself is proved to have been committed.
 39.The evidence of PW10`s overstaying in Singapore came principally from PW1 and PW2. The difficulty the prosecution had was that the Work Permit Department destroyed its records on PW10 and was only relying on the testimony of PW1 and PW2. Counsel contended that their testimony was inadmissible as hearsay only in closing submissions. The fact that an objection is raised at such a late stage is not a bar to admissibility: 
Aw Kew Lim & Ors v PP
 
[1987] SLR 410
 .
 40.It is trite law that the evidence of a statement made to a witness by a person who is not himself called as a witness is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement: 
Subramaniam v PP
 
[1956] 1 WLR 965
. It is not hearsay if the statement is tendered to show the fact that it is made. The Evidence Act does not formulate the rule against hearsay evidence. Rather it adopts an inclusionary rule, stating what may be admitted in evidence. Under s 5 of the Evidence Act, evidence may be given in any proceedings of fact in issue or relevant fact. The common law definition of hearsay corresponds with the terminology of the Evidence Act. Statements of relevant facts are hearsay and inadmissible unless they fall within an exception to the hearsay rule since they are adduced to prove the facts to which they refer. However, where the statement itself is relevant, then it is the fact that the statement was made which is in issue.
 41.I first considered the evidence of PW1. PW1 testified that: (1) she checked with the computer records with the Data Processing Centre in the Immigration Department and had ascertained that PW10 did not extend her social visit pass; (2) she was informed by the Work Permit Department that no work permit was issued to PW10 but what was issued was only an in-principal approval letter for her to work as a domestic maid in Singapore, and this was subsequently cancelled without a work permit being issued.
 42.I think it is of fundamental importance to distinguish between the admissibility of the computer records and the oral evidence of the investigating officer of what the records contain. Only the latter was adduced in this case. In this context, 
R v Patel
 
[1981] 3 All ER 94
 is instructive. In 
 R v Patel 
, an immigration officer testified that he examined the Home Office records which showed that the accused`s name was not in the records as being entitled to a certificate of registration in UK and that therefore he was an illegal entrant. It was held that the immigration officer`s testimony was hearsay. It would have made no difference if the records themselves had been produced. The Home Office records were hearsay evidence as they were adduced to prove the truth of the statements in the records made by the compiler. An officer responsible for their compilation and custody should have been called by the prosecution to give evidence that the method of compilation was such that, if the accused`s name was not in the records, he must be an illegal entrant. Applying the reasoning in Patel, the computer records in the Data Processing Centre were hearsay and inadmissible unless it fell within one of the exceptions.
 43.The position in Singapore differs from the common law position in Patel in that we have statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule for criminal proceedings in ss 378 to 383 CPC. These provisions were modelled after the UK Civil Evidence Act 1968, which ironically only applied to civil proceedings. Section 380 CPC provides for the admissibility of certain records as evidence of facts stated where the conditions are satisfied. Section 380 reads: 
(1) Without prejudice to section 35 of the Evidence Act, in any criminal proceedings a statement contained in a document shall, subject to this section, be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence would be admissible, if -
 
(a) the document is, or forms part of a record compiled by a person acting under a duty from information which was supplied by a person (whether acting under a duty or not) who had, or may reasonably be supposed to have had, personal knowledge of the matters dealt with in that information and which, if not supplied by that person to the compiler of the record directly, was supplied by him to the compiler of the record indirectly through one or more intermediaries each acting under a duty; and 
(b) the conditions specified in subsection (2)(a) or (b) or any of the conditions specified in subsection (2)(c) is satisfied as regards the person who originally supplied the information from which the record containing the statement was compiled
 
(2) The conditions referred to in subsection (1)(b) are the following:
 
 
(c) that it is shown with respect to the person in question -
 
 
(iv) that, having regard to the time which has elapsed since he supplied the information and to all the circumstances, he cannot reasonably be expected to have any recollection of the matters dealt with in the statement.
 
 
(4) Where a document setting out the evidence which a person could be expected to give as a witness has been prepared for the purpose of any pending or contemplated proceedings, whether civil or criminal, and that document falls within subsection (1)(a), then in any criminal proceedings in which that person has been or is to be called as a witness a statement contained in that document shall not be given in evidence by virtue of subsection (2)(a) or (2)(c)(iv) without the leave of the court; and the court shall not give leave under this subsection in respect of any such statement unless it is of the opinion that, in the particular circumstances in which that leave is sought, it is in the interests of justice for the witness`s oral evidence to be supplemented by the reception of that statement or for the statement to be received as evidence of any matter about which he is unable or unwilling to give oral evidence. 
(5) Any reference in this section to a person acting under a duty includes a reference to a person acting in the course of any trade, business, profession or other occupation in which he is engaged or employed or for the purposes of any paid or unpaid office held by him.
 44.There is no doubt that the records are admissible as evidence of the facts stated in them by virtue of s 380. The records form part of the data base records compiled by an immigration officer acting under a duty from information which was supplied by a person who had or reasonably been supposed to have had personal knowledge of matters dealt with in that information. Such a person would be the immigration officer who records the names of the immigrants into Singapore, whether they were granted work permits, in-principle approvals or any extensions of social visit passes. More importantly s 380 also covers the case where the information is not supplied by that person to the compiler directly but is supplied to the compiler of the record indirectly through one or more interested persons each acting under a duty. The supplier of information need not act under a duty. In such a case, the court can take judicial notice that, having regard to the time which has elapsed since he supplied the information and to all the circumstances, he cannot reasonably be expected to have any recollection of the matters dealt with in the statement within s 380(2)(iv). The prohibition in s 380(4) does not apply because such a record is not prepared for the purpose of any pending civil or criminal proceedings, but are administrative measures.
 45.However, in this case, the information from the database records is not actually abstracted in, say, the form of a computer print-out and tendered in court. For some reason, the prosecution only led evidence of the investigation officer`s account of what he saw when he inspected the database. Defence counsel objected to the admissibility of his evidence as to what he saw in the records as hearsay. This requires very careful consideration. Again referring to the definition of hearsay, the evidence of a statement to a witness by a person who is not called as a witness is not hearsay and is admissible when it is proposed to establish by evidence not the truth of the statement, but the fact that it was made:
 Subramaniam v PP 
. Whilst it is desirable to prove the statement in the document by the production of the document or a copy of the document within s 380 CPC, there is no reason why the document could not be proved by direct oral evidence of what the document contains. Section 381 says that the document may be proved by the production of the original or a copy that is duly authenticated, and does not go as far as saying that these are the only two modes of proof. In such a situation, the investigating officer is stating facts concerning the occurrence of the record itself, not about the truth of anything contained in the record. This principle applies because the record is directly relevant and can be introduced under s 380 CPC. Section 380 makes the record relevant and admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.
 46.Hence the evidence of PW1 that she checked the records at the Immigration Department which showed that PW10 entered Singapore on a 14-day social visit pass which expired on 7 January 1995 and was not granted an extension was relevant and admissible to show that PW10 was an overstayer.
 47.In respect of PW1`s evidence that she was informed by the Work Permit Department that no work permit was ever issued to PW10, this was clearly hearsay and inadmissible. PW1`s evidence in this regard had relied entirely on exh P4, a document issued by the Comptroller of Work Permits, stating that no work permit was ever issued. The DPP rightly conceded that P4 was hearsay since it was made out of court and was relied on to prove the truth of the contents of the document. P4 could not be admitted under s 380 CPC since it was prepared in contemplation of criminal proceedings and could not be admitted except with the leave of the court. Of course leave was never granted since the point was not even raised until the submissions stage. For some unknown reason, the prosecution did not call upon the maker of P4 to testify and adopt the contents of P4. PW1`s evidence adopting P4 was clearly hearsay as he was giving evidence as to what another person had said were her findings on her inspection of the records at the Immigration Department.
 48.PW2 gave evidence that P4 was generated by his office, though signed by his colleague. He gave evidence of how applications for foreign maids to work in Singapore are made and processed. PW2 confirmed that PW10 was never issued with a work permit. If he had relied entirely on P4 to reach his conclusion that PW10 was an overstayer, his evidence would be hearsay and inadmissible unless it falls within one of the exceptions. He had no personal knowledge of the contents of P4. However PW2 did not only rely on P4 to reach the conclusion. When he was recalled to clarify the kind of letters they sent to employers when the work permit is cancelled, he testified that the system would automatically generate letters to inform employers that the in-principle approval had expired and the worker had not arrived in Singapore. The court asked PW2 whether the computer system in the Immigration Department had a record of whether such a letter was sent out and PW2 answered yes. When asked what the record showed, PW2 replied that the system informed them that such a letter was sent out on 1 April 1995. PW2 was testifying from his own knowledge and finding that a letter of cancellation of the in-principle approval was sent, evidencing that PW10 did not turn up at the Work Permit Department and accordingly no work permit was ever issued.
 49.PW4 testified that it was only after he signed a consent to transfer PW10 that they received a letter from the Work Permit Department cancelling PW10`s work permit. The defence relied on his evidence to prove that PW10 was issued with a work permit. In my view, the district judge rightly took into account that PW4 was not an unbiased witness, as he could possibly be prosecuted for employing PW10 illegally and hence could have given evidence that was self-serving. She preferred the evidence of PW2 to that of PW4 as PW2 was an independent witness from an administrative agency with no interest in the outcome of the case against the appellant. There is no reason to disturb her finding.
 50.The evidence of PW1 and PW2 was not seriously challenged in cross-examination. Taking the undisputed evidence that PW10 entered Singapore on a 14-day social visit pass which expired on 7 January 1995, with PW1`s evidence that her social visit pass was not extended and PW2`s evidence that no work permit was ever issued, since the Department assumed that the worker did not turn up, I find that it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that PW10 had remained unlawfully in Singapore as from 8 January 1995.
 (3) Principal offender not dealt with
 51.In 
 Ong Ah Yeo Yenna 
 the High Court held that the conviction of the principal offender was not a condition precedent to the conviction of the abettor. I explained the rationale as follows at p 76: 
The fact that the act intentionally aided must have been committed does not mean that the principal should of necessity have been convicted prior to the alleged abettor in order that the latter may be found liable for aiding him. The sequence in which the principal and the intentional aider are tried is frequently a matter of chance; and indeed, on occasion it may not be possible to try the principal at any time at all, for example, where he dies before trial or where he cannot be found. It is quite unacceptable that in these cases the intentional aider should also be immune from liability.
 
In my view, the court which tries an abettor on a charge of intentionally aiding an offence must direct its mind towards making a finding as to whether or not the whole actus reus of the offence he is alleged to have aided was in fact committed; and the court may, indeed must, do so in all cases, including those where the principal has not been convicted of that offence by the time the alleged intentional aider is tried.
 52.Thus it is clear that the fact that the principal offender was not yet tried was not a bar to the conviction of the appellant who was alleged to have intentionally aided the principal offender. Hence whilst PW10 was not convicted under s 15(1) Immigration Act, it is clear that the actus reus of her overstaying in Singapore illegally has been committed.
 (4) Evidence that the principal offence of overstaying in contravention of s 15 was committed as a result of the appellant`s abetment
 53.Counsel argued that the prosecution did not adduce any evidence to show that the principal offence of overstaying in contravention of s 15 was committed as a result of the appellant`s abetment. The notes of evidence plainly indicated otherwise. There was the undisputed evidence that the appellant had sponsored PW10`s entry into Singapore and obtained the in-principle approval letter from Ministry of Labour for her to work as a maid in Singapore. PW 4, 5, 6, 9, 11 and 13 identified the appellant as the person who was PW10`s agent and the person by whom they had been supplied with PW10. The evidence showed that the appellant had brought PW10 into Singapore to work and was under a legal obligation to follow up with the documentation with the Work Permit Department but failed to do so. All the prosecution witnesses who employed PW10, except for PW13, PW4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11 were persons who were known to the appellant and clearly, in several instances, close to him. The evidence of all the employers was clear and damning to the appellant. It was the appellant who supplied PW10 to work in their households. PW10`s testimony of how the appellant sent her to numerous homes was corroborated in material respects by the former employers.
 54.It was true that there were a number of inconsistencies in the evidence of the employers as to the dates in which they employed PW10 and PW10`s evidence as to when she had worked in the various households but the district judge found that they were not material as they did not touch on the issue of whether the appellant intentionally abetted PW10 to overstay. She was entitled to reach such a finding. She was fully entitled to come to the conclusion that PW10 committed the offence of overstaying in consequence of the appellant`s abetment.
 (5) The evidence
 55.It is clear that before the appellant can be held to have abetted PW10 by intentional aiding within s 107(c), he must have the necessary intention to commit the offence. The prosecution must prove that he knew the circumstances constituting the crime when he voluntarily did an act of positive assistance: 
PP v Datuk Tan Cheng Swee
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 166
 . It was argued that the district judge`s finding of the appellant`s guilt was against the weight of evidence. I am unable to accept this submission. The appellant`s main defence, that he had no knowledge that PW10 was an illegal overstayer, was disbelieved by the district judge. The appellant claimed that he handed PW10 and the relevant documents to another employment agent known as Guna so that the latter could not follow up on her application for a work permit and arrange for her to be transferred to another employer. He could not, however, give the particulars of Guna and Guna was not called as a witness. He said that Guna had relatives in Singapore but was unable to produce any of them in court. Nor did he produce any other witness who could attest to the existence of Guna. The learned judge was perfectly entitled to conclude that Guna was a fiction created by the appellant. It remained a fact that the appellant had the legal obligation to apply for a work permit for PW10.
 56.I agree with defence counsel that there appears to be no reason why the appellant would not obtain a work permit or supply PW10 to various employers to work as a domestic maid. However this was not a defence. At the highest, it only showed a lack of motive to commit the offence.
 57.Counsel for the appellant argued that the appellant should be charged for abetting an employer and not a charge for abetment of an illegal overstayer, relying on 
PP v Annamalai Pillai Janathi
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 165
  and 
Daw Aye Aye Mu v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 64
 . The cases do not stand for his proposition. In 
 Annamalai Pillai Janathi 
, the accused was charged with abetting the commission of an offence under s 57(e) Immigration Act by intentionally aiding J to employ a S, domestic maid, who had entered Singapore illegally in contravention of s 6(1) of the Act. It was conceded that there was no evidence that S contravened s 6(1) Immigration Act. The High Court held that the charge should be amended to one of abetting by intentionally aiding J to employ S without a valid work permit contrary to s 5(1) Employment of Foreign Workers Act, Cap 91A. J had already pleaded guilty to a charge under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, for having employed S without obtaining for her a work permit. In 
 Daw Aye Aye Mu 
, the accused was charged with intentionally aiding N in committing the offence of employing SL, who was an illegal overstayer. It was argued that the charge should be amended to one of aiding SL to be employed. The High Court held that whom the accused actually aided would depend on his dominant intention at the time she did the act which led to SL`s employment by N. The prosecution had the discretion in deciding the charge to prefer in all cases but in the cases involving abetment, with two possible principals, the prosecution should determine the most appropriate charge based on the facts of each case.
 58.It is trite law that it is the prerogative of the prosecution to prefer which charges to bring against an accused where a given set of facts gives rise to a number of different charges: 
Govindarajulu v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 838
 . The two decisions do not in any way detract from this proposition. In 
 Annamalai Pillai Jananthi 
, the prosecution should not have proceeded on the original charge when it failed to adduce any evidence that S contravened s 6(1) Immigration Act. In 
 Daw Aye Aye Mu 
, the principle in 
 Govindarajulu 
 was reaffirmed.
 (6) Manner in which the prosecution was conducted
 59.First, the appellant`s counsel argued that he was seriously prejudiced when the prosecutor, instead of trying the case together with PW10 as was originally intended, chose to stand down the charge against PW10 and used her as a prosecution witness. Counsel objected strongly that this amounted to a `deterrent and an inducement` for PW10. Presumably the basis of the appellant`s argument was the common law rule of practice found in 
Pipe v R
 
[1975] 61 Cr App 67
 and 
Turner v R
 
[1966] 51 Cr App R 17
 that it is desirable that, before an accomplice gives evidence against the accused, the prosecution should take one of the following courses: remove him from his indictment, take his plea of guilt, or before calling him, either offer no evidence and permit his acquittal or to enter a 
 nolle prosequi 
. However, this is a matter of discretion for the trial judge (and not an invariable rule) whether to exclude the accomplice`s evidence on the ground that there is an obvious and powerful inducement for him to ingratiate himself with the prosecution and the court: 
 Turner 
. There is also a counter-veiling public interest that criminals must be brought to justice. The district judge was fully entitled to take into account PW10`s evidence.
 60.Moreover, the district judge did take into account that the testimony of PW10 could be self-serving and had to be carefully scrutinised. She explained that she accepted the evidence of PW10 because it was corroborated in material respects by numerous other prosecution witnesses for whom PW10 had worked as a domestic servant, namely PW3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 and even PW14 and 16. In view of the strong corroborative evidence from no less than ten prosecution witnesses, there was no danger that the appellant was convicted based on the evidence of PW10 alone.
 61.The second argument that there was serious prejudice when the district judge directed that only a deleted statement of PW7 would be given to the appellant`s counsel. In examination-in-chief, PW7 testified that PW10 worked from the middle of 1995 to 1997. Defence counsel applied to impeach his testimony under s 157 Evidence Act, on the ground that he made a previous statement to the Immigration Department in which he said that he had employed PW10 from October 1995 to January 1997. PW7 explained that he had made a mistake when he made the statement to the Immigration Department. The district judge ruled that only part of the statement containing the material inconsistencies should be disclosed to counsel. It is desirable for the entire statement to be disclosed to counsel conducting the cross-examination to ascertain the context in which the statement was made: 
Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 185
 . The entire statement ought to be admitted and marked in evidence. However there was really no prejudice faced by the appellant. PW7 readily admitted that he made the mistake in a state of panic and did not dispute the previous statement. The district judge held that the credit of PW7 was not impeached because PW7 was obviously taking a risk by exposing himself to the possibility of a more serious illegal employment charge.
 62.The third argument was that adverse inferences against the prosecution should be drawn pursuant to s 116 illustration (g) Evidence Act in failing to call the wives of PW7 and PW16 as witnesses and failing to offer them to the defence. This argument had no merit at all. It is well settled that in a criminal case, the prosecution has a discretion whether to call a particular witness, provided that there is no ulterior motive and the witness, who is available to, but not called by, the prosecution is offered to the defence: 
Lim Young Sien v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 257
 . There was no suggestion of an ulterior motive. The prosecutor had explained that PW7`s wife was overseas and PW16`s wife was in the family way. The prosecutor inadvertently overlooked to offer them to the defence but the defence knew all along who those witnesses were and could have easily reminded the prosecution to offer the witnesses to them if they were so desirous of calling. However they did not do so and could not now complain.
 63.The fourth argument was that the evidence of PW12 should be disregarded because he had allegedly admitted that he was intimidated by the prosecutor. PW12 said that, if he did not change his statement, he would not let him off until he got to the bottom of the case. Witness intimidation is a very serious allegation, and the statement hardly supports an admission of PW12 that he had changed his evidence because he was intimidated. There is bound to be a level of tension when a witness is being questioned by a law enforcement officer in the course of his investigations and this is nothing more than an attempt to get PW12 to co-operate with the investigation. Telling a witness during investigation that he should tell the truth, without more, cannot possibly amount to witness intimidation.
 64.Finally, it was argued that the evidence of PW10 receiving a sum of $3,910 was prejudicial and should have been excluded by the district judge. The evidence of PW10 receiving a sum of money just prior to trial and being told not to turn up in court was relevant as an attempt being made to subvert the course of justice. However, the prosecution did not prove that it was the appellant or anyone else acting on his behalf who offered the money. The district judge did not consider this evidence in reaching her decision, apart from narrating it as a part of PW10`s evidence, and there really was no prejudice to the appellant.
 65.In all the circumstances there was no reason to differ from the district judge`s conclusion that the charge had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
 66.
 Appeal against sentence
The appellant was sentenced to the maximum term of imprisonment of six months and was given nine strokes of the cane. The appellant, being the abettor, faced the same punishment as that prescribed for the overstayer under s 109 Penal Code. Under s 15(3) of the Immigration Act, the appellant was liable for an imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months and subject to caning with not less than three strokes.
 67.The appellant argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The district judge considered that a deterrent sentence was called for since the conduct of the appellant was reprehensible. After bringing PW10 to Singapore, he had no qualms about sending PW10 to various households and in keeping her in Singapore for more than two years, despite her pleas to be allowed to return to India. Eventually she was driven to seek the assistance of the police even though she suspected that she was then guilty of overstaying. Having regard to the factors considered by the district judge, and also the need to protect the public interest in deterring would-be offenders from abetting illegal overstayers to remain in Singapore, the sentence imposed was not excessive. As such, it should stand. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.",1998-08-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW JC
 The petitioner pleaded guilty and was convicted of remaining in Singapore after the expiry of his social visit pass for three months and seven days without reasonable cause, an offence under s 15(1) Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed). He sought revision of his conviction and also applied in Criminal Motion 17/98 to admit his affidavit filed on 6 August 1998 and oral evidence at the hearing of the criminal revision. I dismissed the motion and the petition and now give my reasons.
 2.
 Facts
On 22 July 1998, the petitioner was charged in the district court as follows: 
You, Chan Chun Yee (M/29.2.68) 30 years old Malaysian Passport No: H101507 are charged that you, from 15 April 1998 to 21 July 1998 did contravene the provisions of s 15(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133), to wit, that without reasonable cause, you did remain in Singapore after the expiry of the visit pass issued to you on 31 March 1998 permitting you to remain in Singapore till 14 April 1998 and you have thereby committed an offence under s 15(3), punishable under s 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) as amended by the Immigration (Amendment) Act 1995.
 3.The petitioner appeared in person and pleaded guilty after the charge was read and explained to him in Mandarin and he was told the nature and consequences of his plea. He admitted the statement of facts in support of the charge without qualification. The statement stated: 
The accused, a Malaysian national, 30 years of age, was arrested by Immigration officers on 21 July 1998 for having overstayed in Singapore. 
2 Investigation revealed that the accused arrived in Singapore on 31 March 1998 and was granted a visit pass valid till 14 April 1998. Upon expiry of the visit pass on 14 April 1998, the accused did not leave Singapore or apply for extension of stay. He then remained there unlawfully. 
3 Investigation also revealed that the accused`s purpose here was to seek employment. 
4 The accused had up to the time of his arrest on 21 July 1998, remained unlawfully in Singapore for a period of three months and seven days and has therefore committed an offence punishable under s 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133).
 4.The petitioner was convicted of this charge. A second charge of having in his possession a forged Singapore Immigration social visit pass endorsement was taken into consideration for sentencing. In mitigation, the petitioner asked for leniency. The district judge sentenced him to two months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
 5.Notwithstanding his plea of guilty in the district court, the petitioner filed a petition for criminal revision asking the High Court to exercise its revisionary powers under s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) to quash the conviction on the ground that the conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory. In order to show that the conviction was unsatisfactory, he applied for leave to adduce fresh evidence to show that he had a valid defence to the charge, namely, that he held the belief that he was entitled to remain in Singapore by virtue of the special pass endorsed on his passport.
 6.
 The criminal motion
Before me, the petitioner applied for leave to adduce his affidavit in support of his application to adduce fresh evidence, which essentially said that he held the belief that the endorsements on his passport were genuine and that he was entitled to remain in Singapore.
 7.Section 268(1) CPC makes it clear that the revisionary powers of the High Court include the power to order the taking of additional evidence in accordance with s 257(1). The principles to be followed in deciding if additional evidence should be taken are set out in

[1954] 3 All ER 745
. Briefly, first, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given at the trial, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; and thirdly, the evidence must be apparently credible although it need not be incontrovertible.
 8.Applying the principles above to the present case, it was clear that the first condition was not satisfied. The evidence of the petitioner of his own belief that he was entitled to remain in Singapore was clearly available at the time of the trial and the petitioner could well have claimed trial and explained to the district court his belief that the endorsements on the passport were genuine.
 9.In 
 Juma`at bin Samad 
, the court held that: 
It is true that there are situations where the court would allow additional evidence to be called even though it could not be strictly said that the evidence was not available at the time of trial, if it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. The core principle of s 257 CPC after all, is that additional evidence may be taken if it is necessary in the interests of justice. That said, it must be emphasised in no uncertain terms that such a situation will arise only in the most extraordinary circumstances.
 10.There were no grounds here for invoking the exception in the interests of justice and counsel did not provide any. This is a narrow exception and is warranted only by the most extenuating circumstances, which may include the fact that the offence is a serious one attracting grave consequences and the fact that the additional evidence sought to be adduced is highly cogent and pertinent and the strength of which renders the conviction unsafe. Counsel argued that there were exceptional circumstances, being that the petitioner failed to understand the nature and consequences of the plea and that he was confused or intimidated by the proceedings which led him to plead guilty. These are circumstances which are clearly relevant only to the criminal revision in seeking to retract the plea of guilt and not to the criminal motion in seeking to adduce fresh evidence on the circumstances relating to the commission of the offence. I will consider these arguments in the petition for criminal revision below.
 11.The relevance and credibility of additional evidence are related aspects. If the appellant held the belief that the endorsements on his passport were genuine, that would constitute `reasonable cause` within s 15(3) of the Act to remain in Singapore despite the fact that his social visit pass had expired. The petitioner has to satisfy the court that the additional evidence is apparently credible and, if believed, establishes on a balance of probabilities that he had a valid defence. I was of the view that the additional evidence did not achieve this. The DPP adduced the affidavit of the investigating officer, Senior Inspector of Immigration Tay Liang Kim, which exhibited a statement by the petitioner on 21 July 1998, that was made after his arrest. In that statement, the petitioner admitted that he knew that the endorsements on his passport could not have been genuine because he did not apply for a work permit and did not undergo any medical check-up; he knew that these two were prerequisites before such a permit could be granted. Given his admission, I came to the conclusion that the additional evidence was not apparently credible.
 12.Therefore his application to allow the fresh evidence should not be allowed.
 13.
 The criminal revision
The grounds for criminal revision, as set out in the petition, were that the petitioner`s plea of guilt was equivocal. He was not aware that the endorsements on his passport were forged. He pleaded guilty involuntarily on the inducement of the immigration officer who told him that he had a hopeless case and that the judge would not believe his defence that he did not know that the endorsements were false. He did not know that he had a defence of reasonable cause to remain in Singapore on the basis of the special pass which he thought was genuine at the material time.
 14.The petition stated that he entered Singapore on 31 March 1998 and was given the usual two week social visit pass which expired on 14 April 1998. He approached his friend, one `Ah Meng`, who ran a restaurant business in Bedok North Avenue 2 known as `Tong Seng Restaurant` to work as a cook. Ah Meng agreed and the petitioner handed his passport to him. Ah Meng offered to apply for him the `special pass` which, according to him, would enable the petitioner to remain and work in Singapore for three months. Ah Meng returned the passport with the special pass endorsed with the words `03: 10 April 1998 - 16 July 1998: Visa`) and the petitioner believed that the special pass was genuine and that he could remain in Singapore until 16 July 1998. On 5 July 1998 the petitioner expressed his desire to return to Malaysia and requested Ah Meng to apply to cancel his special pass. He handed the passport to Ah Meng and it was duly endorsed with the exit pass and the social visit pass.
 15.Since the petitioner had pleaded guilty to the charge, I considered whether his plea of guilt was valid and unequivocal. The safeguards for ensuring the validity of such pleas were set out in 
Ganesun s/o Kannan v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 560
 , applied in 
Virgie Rizza V Leong v PP
 (Unreported) : first, the court must ensure the accused himself wishes to plead guilty; secondly, the court must ascertain if the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea; and thirdly, the court must establish that the accused intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him. 
 Ganesun s/o Kannan 
concerned an accused who wished to retract his plea of guilt before sentencing. However, the same test for determining the validity of a plea of guilt applies as well where criminal revision is sought following conviction and sentencing: 
Rajeevan Edakalavan v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 815
 , 
 Virgie Rizza V Leong v PP 
.
 16.The petitioner`s plea of guilt certainly appeared to be prima facie valid. From the notes of evidence, the charge and statement of facts were read to him and he seemed to understand fully. He admitted without qualification to the facts. The petitioner had no complaints about linguistic competence of the court interpreter. There is nothing in the petitioner`s plea or mitigation which can be taken as a qualification or equivocation of his intention to plead guilty. However he claimed that: (1) he was unaware of the possible defence which was that he believed that the endorsements on his passport were genuine; and (2) he was induced by the immigration officer to plead guilty.
 17.I first considered the alleged representations by the immigration officers. Even if the representations were in fact made, they were not positive misrepresentations as to the rights of the appellant. The alleged representations by the immigration officer to the appellant were merely that the endorsements in his passport were forged and that he was not likely to be believed in court if he said that he did not know of the forgery. There was no deception imputed to the prosecution. It was not the duty of the prosecution to inform the accused of defences or other options open to him. The fact that the immigration officer did not inform the appellant as to any defences which might be open to him did not make his representations an inducement to plead guilty. More importantly, in court, the district judge explained to him the charge, the nature and consequences of the plea to him. Counsel`s argument that he was induced to plead guilty by the representations of the immigration officer was without any merit.
 18.As for the claim that he was ignorant of a possible defence because he was unrepresented, this argument had no merit. In 
Packir Malim v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 429
 , it was held that pleas of guilt by unrepresented persons were not more easily vitiated than those by represented persons. 
 Rajeevan Edakalavan v PP 
 suggested that an unrepresented accused`s plea of guilt will not be vitiated by his ignorance of possible defences. The essential test of criminal revision is whether there has been some serious injustice or whether the decision of the lower court is perverse: 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
 . As held in 
 Virgie Rizza V Leong v PP 
, an accused who unnecessarily pleads guilty has added to his own problems, but there is no reason for a court to uphold a conviction if it can be clearly demonstrated to be wrong in law or in fact.
 19.I thus considered if the petitioner held the belief that the endorsements on his passport were genuine, such that it consisted reasonable cause to remain in Singapore. However, I was not persuaded this was the case. The prosecution adduced an affidavit from the investigating officer in charge of the case together with the statement made by petitioner shortly after his arrest, which has been referred to earlier. In the statement, he admitted that he knew that the endorsements on the passport could not be genuine because he had not applied for a work permit to work in Singapore nor had he gone for any medical checkup which he knew was necessary before a work permit could be granted. His claim that he was ignorant that the endorsements in the passport were forged could not be believed.
 20.For these reasons, I rejected the petitioner`s contention that he held the belief that the endorsements on his passport were genuine and he was entitled to remain in Singapore.
 21.This was sufficient to dispose of the petition for revision. However, further comments may be made as to the petitioner`s claim that he believed that the endorsements on his passport were genuine and that this constituted `reasonable cause` to remain in Singapore within s 15(3) Immigration Act. The relevant provision is set out below: 
15 (1) A person shall not remain in Singapore after the cancellation of any permit or certificate, or after the making of a declaration under section 14(4) or after the expiration or notification to him, in such manner as may be prescribed, of the cancellation of any pass relating to or issued to him unless he is otherwise entitled or authorised to remain in Singapore under the provisions of this Act or the regulations. 
 
(3) Any person who contravenes, 
 without reasonable cause 
, this section shall be guilty of an offence and -
 
 
(b) in the case where he remains unlawfully for a period exceeding 90 days, shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and shall also, subject to section 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), be punished with caning with not less than 3 strokes, or where by virtue of that section he is not punishable with caning, he shall, in lieu of caning, be punished with a fine not exceeding $6,000.
 22.`Reasonable cause` is not defined but in 
 Virgie Rizza V Leong v PP 
, the High Court held that what suffices as reasonable cause must depend on the circumstances of each case. Where the accused is relying on the defence that he believes that he is entitled to remain in Singapore lawfully, the phrase `reasonable cause` indicates that the accused must not only genuinely hold the belief that the endorsements are valid, but there must objectively be evidence showing that the belief is reasonable in the circumstances. In that case, the accused was charged under s 15 Immigration Act and her defence was that she was deceived by one Leong who fooled her into thinking she could legally remain in Singapore because of the forged endorsement of the visit pass in her passport and her forged Singaporean identity card which Leong told her was issued to her as his wife. The High Court held that, even if the accused`s version was true, it would not amount to `reasonable cause`. The accused did not claim to have taken any steps to check her own status and the appellant had not married Leong and had no proper grounds for believing that she had been issued a Singapore identity card.
 23.The High Court made the important observation that blind reliance on others for compliance with the Immigration Act could not possibly afford a defence on the facts. The burden has to be on those claiming that they believe that they have a right to enter or remain in Singapore based on visit passes or any other passes issued to them, that they have taken reasonable steps to ensure that their passes are genuine and have made reasonable inquiries to verify their own immigration status. Otherwise the provisions are unworkable. A strict approach is necessary. There are serious social implications of unrestricted immigration which the Act attempts to curb. The petitioner alleged that he relied on Ah Meng to get proper approval for him. He did not claim to have taken any steps to check his own status. On 8 July 1998 he was handed his passport by Ah Meng which had an exit pass and social visit pass endorsed on it. His suspicions arose since he did not leave Singapore and the exit pass should not be endorsed. Ah Meng allegedly told him that he was unsure about the endorsements. Yet the petitioner was content to leave the matter as it stood.
 24.For the above reasons, I dismissed the petition for criminal revision.",1998-08-17 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant was charged with two counts of criminal breach of trust as a servant under s 408 Penal Code for amounts of $2,720 and $737.39 on 18 November 1989 and 5 October 1990 respectively and one count of dishonest misappropriation of $742.61 under s 403 Penal Code on 5 October 1990. He claimed trial to all three charges. At the start of the proceedings, he applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground that continued prosecution would be an abuse of process, and claimed immunity from prosecution granted in a letter dated 27 September 1991 from the Attorney General`s Chambers (`the AGC`). Prior to the hearing before the district judge, the parties consented to have this application tried as a preliminary issue.
 2.
 Events leading to the present proceedings 
 
On 22 June 1998, the district judge dismissed the application (`the preliminary issue`). In his grounds of decision, he held that the immunity from prosecution granted in the AGC`s letter of 27 September 1991 (`the AGC`s letter`) did not extend to the subject matter of the present three charges. The evidence before him indicated that the scope of investigations up to 27 September 1991 did not extend to include any investigations into the subject-matter of the present three charges. He directed that the trial on the present three charges proceed.
 3.However, the hearing of this preliminary issue had by this time occupied the six days originally reserved for the substantive hearing and defence counsel due to prior trial engagements sought an adjournment. This was granted by the district judge and the substantive hearing was scheduled to resume in the Subordinate Courts on 17 August 1998. In the interim, defence counsel appealed against and also petitioned for criminal revision of the preliminary ruling. On 11 August 1998, after hearing defence counsel`s submissions, I dismissed the appeal on the ground that there was no right of appeal. The petition for criminal revision was heard on 13 August 1998 and dismissed. Since substantially the same submissions were relied on, my grounds of decision for the dismissal of both the appeal and the petition are given below.
 4.
 The hearing of the preliminary issue 
 
The district judge identified two inter-related primary issues: (1) whether the appellant was entitled to rely on his subjective understanding and expectations as to what the AGC`s letter was meant to convey and correspondingly, (2) whether the defence could establish that the subject-matter of the present three charges was in fact investigated prior to 27 September 1991, the date of the AGC`s letter. Essentially, the defence had to prove on a balance of probabilities that the `immunity` purportedly contained in the AGC`s letter would extend to the subject-matter of the present three charges.
 5.This, he found, required an understanding of what the term `investigations` meant in the proper context, as well as whether the term extended to the Auditor-General`s conduct in 1991 of an audit (`the 1991 audit`) of the Commercial Affairs Department (`CAD`). He accepted the undisputed evidence that the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (`CPIB`) investigations are not initiated until information about some alleged offence is received. Drawing this finding to the context of any ongoing criminal proceedings, he held that, where `investigations` were mentioned, the term referred in its natural and ordinary sense to `investigations which potentially give rise to criminal prosecution`. In this connection, he rejected the defence contention that the term `investigations` used in the correspondence exchanged between defence counsel and the AGC should be construed widely to include the 1991 audit.
 6.Notwithstanding the above, the district judge proceeded to consider whether, on the evidence of the classified audit documents before him and released to the defence during the hearing, the 1991 audit involved investigation into the subject-matter of the present three charges. With respect to the first charge, the defence had contended that the role of M & C Services Ltd (`M & C`) must have been looked at during the 1991 audit. The district judge found that the 1991 audit report patently did not indicate any enquiry into the M & C client account nor that M & C was itself the subject of investigations. Similarly, he found no specific reference made in any of the audit documents which concerned the second and third charges. On the balance of probabilities, the district judge found that the sole concern of the 1991 audit was CAD`s receipt of prosecution costs and, in the circumstances, did not extend to investigation into the present three charges.
 7.The district judge considered both the letter from the appellant`s counsel at the material time to the AGC (`the appellant`s letter`) and the AGC`s letter in reply and opined that it was not the appellant`s subjective expectation that was relevant but whether his request for such immunity was communicated in clear and unambiguous terms to the AGC. The district judge held that, on an objective interpretation of the appellant`s letter, the appellant sought immunity in relation to any possible charges which could have arisen out of those investigations as they stood in September 1991. He went on to observe that the DPP had expressly rejected the appellant`s request for a `blanket immunity` and was only prepared to give a limited assurance that the investigations as they stood at the material time would not form the basis of further charges. The scope of the immunity claimed therefore turned on whether the present three charges were investigated into prior to 27 September 1991.
 8.The district judge accepted the evidence of Tan Ah Leak (`Tan`), the former CPIB Senior Assistant Director who was in charge of the investigations in 1991, that the 1991 investigations conducted in relation to the accused generally concerned engaging in private business without approval, giving false information to the CPIB, causing false information to be entered into hotel reservation cards, cheating involving the Biima Private Limited project in Batam and obtaining loans from government with the use of false documents. He was of the opinion that this list was not exhaustive since Tan was relying on his memory to testify on matters that had arisen in 1991. Furthermore, he noted that Tan`s candid testimony confirmed that there were no investigations into M & C in 1991 nor was there investigation conducted into any suspected misappropriation of CAD funds. The district judge observed the absence of any evidence to indicate affirmatively that investigations into the subject-matter of the present three charges were probably conducted in 1991. In his assessment of the evidence, the immunity relied upon by the defence dating from 27 September 1991 did not extend to the present three charges and, in the circumstances, he ordered that the trial should proceed.
 9.
 Magistrate`s appeal 
 
The appellant`s case may be briefly summarised as follows. Counsel for the appellant sought to persuade the court that on the evidence before me it was clear that the subject matter of the three charges had been part of investigations carried out in 1991. He argued that the prosecution`s claim that such investigations only began in 1997 was untenable and, to that end, pointed to several portions of Tan Ah Leak`s testimony with regard to the extent and foci of investigations carried out on the appellant in 1991, in which counsel claimed that Tan qualified his evidence and framed his answers to suit the prosecution case. Counsel brought the court through the audit reports released to the defence in the proceedings appealed from, and submitted that the detailed audit reports made in 1991 reflected an investigation that would have left no stone unturned and invited the court to infer that such thorough investigations must have extended to the subject-matter of the present three charges against the appellant.
 10.Counsel contended that the CPIB must necessarily have a close working relationship with other governmental agencies such as the Auditor-General`s Office. He submitted that some of the prosecutions brought against (for example) one Peter Chi had been initiated following investigations carried out by the Auditor-General`s Office. In this light, he argued that it could not have been the appellant`s intention, given the appellant`s years of experience as a legal officer, to negotiate a plea-bargain promising immunity restricted to only those charges brought about by the CPIB investigations.
 11.Perhaps in some respects I could appreciate counsel`s difficulty in defending a case of this nature. There had been a substantial lapse of time between the alleged commission of the offence and the present prosecution. Tan, the chief investigating officer at the material time, had to rely on his memory of events in 1991. This was noted by the district judge in his grounds of decision. The district judge had not denied that Tan`s testimony was at times inconsistent, but he had accepted Tan`s evidence in the absence of contrary evidence. Furthermore, the defence was, shall we say, handicapped to the extent that the prosecution`s case potentially concerned various secret and/or confidential documents which they were understandably hesitant to disclose. While the investigations were obviously quite extensive, it was the defence`s burden to isolate the focus of the investigations and prove them to include the subject-matter of the present three charges. In that respect, I did not think that the defence was prejudiced in so far as a similar task would have had to be undertaken by other defence counsel.
 12.
 Right of appeal 
 
One issue for which I had expressed my concern at the start of the hearing was the question of whether the appellant had a right of appeal, in the circumstances of the present case. It was, for want of a better term, an interlocutory appeal that to my knowledge had not been permitted for criminal prosecutions. For example, it is clearly not the habit of the English courts, having dealt with preliminary issues such as a voire dire on the admissibility of a confession, to discharge the jury only to ask them to deal with the same issues after proceedings had been stayed to allow an appeal from the voire dire. Counsel conceded that he had foreseen this difficulty and taken the precaution of lodging a petition for revision should the appellant be held not to have a right of appeal.
 13.It is perhaps not necessary for me to consider the authorities on a right of appeal in a detailed discussion. It is trite law that the right of appeal is a creature of statute and not part of the inherent jurisdiction of an appellate court. Briefly, s 19 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (`the SCJA`) provides for the exercise of this jurisdiction and s 19(a) extends the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the High Court to include the hearing of appeals from district courts or magistrates` courts according to the provisions of the law for the time being in force relating to criminal procedure. This in turn refers the court to the Criminal Procedure Code, in particular, s 247(1). Subject to certain limitations stated in the provision, s 247(1) empowers any person who is dissatisfied with any judgment, sentence or order pronounced by any district court or magistrate`s court in a criminal case or matter to which he is a party, to prefer an appeal to the High Court against that judgment, sentence or order in respect of any error in law or in fact.
 14.There was no question that this appeal arose out of a criminal case or matter. The concern was with whether the district judge`s order was appealable on the basis that it was not a final order. Although not expressly stipulated by statute, case law has yielded the overriding requirement of finality in the judgment, sentence or order appealed against to qualify for a right of appeal. The court in 
Maleb bin Su v PP
 
 
[1984] 1 MLJ 311
  applied the ejusdem generis rule in interpreting s 307(i) CPC (in pari materia to our s 247(1) CPC) and held, at p 312B of the judgment: 
The order must therefore be a final order in the sense that it is final in effect as in the case of a judgment or a sentence. The test for determining the finality of an order is to see whether the judgment or order finally disposes of the rights of the parties.
 15.This test had its roots in the Indian Federal Court`s decision in 
Mohd Amin Bros v Dominion of India
 
[1950] FC 77
. Although the relevant statute in that case specified that the appellate jurisdiction could only be invoked in respect of a judgment or decree or final order passsed, applying the ejusdem generis rule of interpretation to our s 247(1) inferred a requirement of finality in any order appealed against. The court in 
 Mohd Amin 
 discussed several authorities, including 
 Abdul Rahman v Cassim 
 AIR (20) 1933 PC 58 wherein the judge noted that `the finality must be in relation to the suit. If after the order the suit is still a live suit in which the rights of the parties have to be determined, no appeal lies against it.` From this, the bench in 
 Mohd Amin 
 concluded that the position with regard to a `final order` was well settled and made the following useful observation at p 79 of the report: 
The fact that the order decides an important and even a vital issue is by itself not material. If the decision on an issue puts an end to the suit, the order will undoubtedly be a final one, but if the suit is still left alive and has got to be tried in the ordinary way, no finality could attach to the order.
 16.I relied on the authority of 
Ramchand v Goverdhandas
 
[1920] AIR 86
 for the proposition that an order refusing a stay of suit was not a final order. One might say that 
 Ramchand 
 was an excellent case on point, given the district judge`s refusal to stay proceedings and his consequent order that the charges be proven against the appellant by the courts in the ordinary way. 
 Ramchand 
 was followed in 
 Abdul Rahman 
 where an order of remand was acknowledged to be `an order that went to the root of the suit, namely, the jurisdiction of the court to entertain it ... but this was not sufficient. The finality must be a finality in relation to the suit.`
 17.In any case, the Court of Appeal in Singapore held in 
Mohamed Razip & Ors v PP
 
[1987] SLR 142
 at p 145; 
[1988] 1 MLJ 84
 at p 86 that the definition of the word `judgment` meant a final order in a trial terminating in the conviction or acquittal of the accused. A similar ruling was made in the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Ang Cheng Hai v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 201
 . It was held in this case that there lies no right of appeal against a judge`s refusal to transfer a case from the subordinate courts to the High Court (under s 185 CPC) as the Court of Appeal is `only empowered to entertain appeals concerned with orders of finality, ie those resulting in conviction or sentence.`
 18.Counsel for the defence agreed that the test of finality was whether the order finally disposed of the rights of the parties. He urged the court to consider the question in its natural and ordinary sense. He contended that the district judge`s order appealed from was final in that it could have resulted in the stay of criminal proceedings lodged against the appellant and the matter would have been disposed of. I could not agree. Taking his contention one step further, if the district judge had found (as in the present case) that the immunity did not extend to the subject-matter of the present three charges, and refused to stay a trial of the charges, and the hearing then proceeds; the order cannot be said in the circumstances to be final. This is to be distinguished from the substantive right of every person convicted in the subordinate courts to appeal against the conviction. I was not able to accept a dissection of criminal proceedings for the purposes of rendering the present appeal valid. The operative effect of the district judge`s order had been to order the continued hearing of the trial in the ordinary way by the courts. Accordingly, I found that the appellant was precluded from appealing at this stage of the proceedings.
 19.
 Criminal revision 
 
Nevertheless, counsel for the appellant asked the court to invoke its powers of revision and intervene with the district judge`s decision below. Counsel for the appellant had earlier conceded that an appeal was preferred because the principles of revision were so strict. I felt constrained to agree. The relevant statutory provisions are s 23 SCJA supplemented by s 266 of the CPC. The court`s immediate duty is to satisfy itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any order passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court. However, this is not sufficient to require the intervention of the courts on revision. The irregularity or otherwise noted from the record of proceedings must have resulted in grave and serious injustice.
 20.The principles of revision were discussed at length in 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
  where I accepted the principles as stated in 
State of Orissa v Nakula Sahu
 
[1979] AIR 663
 by Jaswant Singh J when he delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court of India and, at p 666 of the report, said: 
[It] is now well settled that normally the jurisdiction of the High Court under [the equivalent section] is to be exercised only in exceptional cases when there is a 
 glaring defect in the procedure or there is a manifest error on a point of law which has consequently resulted in flagrant miscarriage of justice
. [Emphasis mine.]
 I was also guided by the observations of Dua J in 
Akalu Ahir v Ramdeo Ram
 
[1973] AIR 2145
 where he observed that the power of revision was an extraordinary discretionary power vested in the superior court to set right grave injustice. At p 2147 of the record, Dua J commented that: 
[the] High Court has been invested with this power to see that justice is done in accordance with the 
 recognized rules of criminal jurisprudence
 and that the subordinate courts 
 do not exceed their jurisdiction or abuse the power
 conferred on them by law. 
 As a general rule, this power, in spite of the wide language of [the equivalent sections] Cr PC, does not contemplate interference with the conclusions of fact in the absence of serious legal infirmity and failure of justice
.
 21.In respect of the present case, I repeat my observations made in 
 Ang Poh Chuan 
 where at p 330 I noted that a misconception of law may undoubtedly cause undeserved hardship. However, revision cannot without more be invoked always to remedy that for, if it were otherwise, such jurisdiction would be little more than another form of appeal, and that is clearly not the intention of the statute. In this respect, 
Heng Lee Handbags & Anor v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 760
  itself is instructive, for in that case, though it would appear that there was irregularity in the exercise of a power by a magistrate, the reason why the application was dismissed was because no serious injustice was caused to the appellant.
 22.Therein lay my difficulty in arriving at a decision. It was clear from the authorities that powers of revision can only be exercised in exceptional circumstances. It was also clear that a court does not hear a petition of revision as it does an appeal. For instance, courts are slower to revise findings of fact on revision: 
R Jagadish Murty v Balaram Mohanty & Ors
 
[1992] Cr LJ 996
 as well as Dua J`s comments in 
 Akalu Ahir 
 above. To some the court`s powers on appeal and revision are distinct in the sense that an appellant has a right to demand adjudication on a question of law or fact while a petitioner in a revision only brings his case to the notice of the court which may interfere in the exercise of its discretion as to the proper case: 
 Pushpabai v Pandurang 
 ILR (1975) Bom 1300 (1301). The authorities demonstrate that the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court is not to be ordinarily invoked merely because the court below had taken a wrong view of law or failed to appreciate the evidence on record. Even if a different view is possible, there will be no revisionary interference where the court below has taken a view of the evidence on record and no glaring defect of procedure or jurisdiction has taken place:

 where no interference was ordered with the lower magistrate`s finding of fact because the order suffered from no legal infirmity.
 23.These were important considerations when I embarked on examining the present facts in view of the petition for revision. I was also mindful that such a wide discretion afforded by the wording of the legislation also carried a greater burden for the petitioner to prove that this was a proper case for revision. The difficulty was that much of counsel for the appellant`s very able arguments would have suited an appeal. However, as conceded by counsel, a higher standard is required before the powers of revision are justifiably invoked. The district judge in his grounds of decision noted that a stay of proceedings was in itself an exceptional application to be granted only in the rarest cases. To some extent, this qualifies some of my reservations on intervening in revision. In my view, issues of fairness and justice such as those determining abuse of process, may be more equitably determined in the light of evidence adduced by the close of the substantive trial. Taking the present proceedings at this stage and, more importantly, in the absence of any glaring defect of procedure or wrongful exercise of jurisdiction by the district judge, I did not feel able to exercise my discretion to intervene.",1998-08-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Introduction
The appellant in this case faced the following charge in the court below: 
You, Tay Huay Hong, are charged that you, sometime between April and 13 June 1996, in Singapore and elsewhere, together with one Lloyd Marius Lochra, Ng Chee Kheong and other persons, were party to a criminal conspiracy, and in pursuance of and in order to carry out the object of the said conspiracy, agreed with one another to do an illegal act, to wit, to cheat Amcol Holdings Ltd into investing a sum of US$39.60m, which was to be paid by Amcol Holdings Ltd for a 40% stake in a joint venture company incorporated in Mauritius styled `Guibies Holdings Ltd`, contrary to s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 120B(1) of the same Code.
 
Particulars
 
(1) In early April 1996, Ng Chee Kheong, an executive director of Amcol Holdings Ltd (`Amcol`) received a proposal from one Roland Maurel, the owner of Sando & Cie in Mauritius styled `Guibies Holdings Ltd`. For a total consideration of US$35.85m, Amcol was to get a 51% share in a casino and a racing track venture, and a 50% share in a residential property venture. 
(2) Ng Chee Kheong and Lloyd Lochra, also an executive director of Amcol, decided to seek the assistance of Tay Huay Hong to source for another investor in the joint venture project. 
(3) Towards the end of April 1996, Ng Chee Kheong, Lloyd Lochra and Tay Huay Hong agreed to mark up the investment sum for the joint venture project by US$3.75m, which sum was to be shared equally by Tay Huay Hong, Ng Chee Kheong and Lloyd Lochra. 
(4) Sometime between 28 to 30 April 1996, Roland Maurel was informed of the plan to inflate the investment sum by US$3.75m and it was agreed that the said sum would be remitted in equal shares to Tay Huay Hong, Ng Chee Kheong and Lloyd Lochra. 
(5) In early May 1996, Ng Chee Kheong, Lloyd Lochra and Tay Huay Hong conspired to offer the joint venture project to Amcol at the inflated price of US$39.60m, which included the mark up of US$3.75m, which sum was to be shared equally by Tay Huay Hong, Ng Chee Kheong and Lloyd Lochra. 
(6) Both Lloyd Lochra and Ng Chee Kheong spoke to various members of the board of directors. A report dated 10 May 1996 on the investment proposal was circulated to the board of directors to dishonestly induce the board of directors to approve the investment proposal. 
(7) On 20 May 1996, the board of directors of Amcol approved the purchase by Amcol of 40% of the joint venture company`s issued and paid up capital for a total consideration of US$39.60m, which they would not have done had they not been so deceived. 
(8) On 22 May 1996, a joint venture agreement was signed between Amcol Holdings Ltd and Sando & Cie in Singapore. Amcol made their first payment of US$13.62m on 28 May 1996 and the second payment of US$25.98m on 13 June 1996 for the subscription of 5 million shares in `Guibies Holdings Ltd`. 
(9) In late June 1996, the following sums were deposited: 
(i) US$300,000 into an account in the name of Thio Swie Ling in Banque Centrale Asia, Indonesia for Ng Chee Kheong; 
(ii) US$300,000 into an account in Coutts & Co for Tay Huay Hong; 
(iii) US$300,000 into a trust account for Lloyd Lochra.
 The appellant, who claimed trial, was convicted and sentenced to 20 months` imprisonment. The appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. After hearing counsel for the appellant, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 2.
 The prosecution`s case
The mainstay of the prosecution`s case was the evidence of Ng Chee Kheong (Ng). Ng was an executive director of Amcol. He testified that in January 1996, he was informed of the prospect of a partnership in a joint venture project in Mauritius. The project comprised a casino, a race course and residential property. Ng was introduced to one Roland Maurel (Maurel), the Mauritius party offering the partnership in the joint venture. Amcol was offered a 51% share in the joint venture project for US$35.85m.
 3.Ng prepared two reports on the joint venture project for Henry Pribadi (Pribadi), the managing director of Amcol. Pribadi was ambivalent about the project as the board of directors was facing a motion by Amcol`s shareholders to have them removed and was unlikely to be interested in such an investment at that point in time.
 4.Both these reports were copied to one Lloyd Lochra (Lloyd), an executive director of Amcol. Lloyd proposed that the project be offered to a third party, and that the appellant be roped in to help find a third party investor.
 5.The appellant met with Lloyd and Ng at the Tanglin Club in April 1996. The appellant was briefed on the joint venture project and the need to find a third party investor. The appellant said that they should receive a commission for finding a third party investor to be shared equally between the three of them.
 6.Lloyd proposed that the three of them should receive a total commission of US$3.75m. This would be incorporated into the price of the project. The price of the project was accordingly marked up US$3.75m to US$39.60m. Ng agreed and informed the appellant about the proposed commission and the mark up in price. The appellant agreed.
 7.In late April 1996, Lloyd, Ng and the appellant flew to Mauritius to meet Maurel. Maurel agreed to the proposed commission and the mark up in price. However, Maurel informed them that an investor would now only receive a 40% shareholding in the project for the price of US$35.85m, down from the original offer of a 51% shareholding for the same price. Lloyd, Ng and the appellant agreed to this variation in the offer. Maurel also asked them to find an investor by June 1996.
 8.The appellant searched for a third party investor, but was unable to find one who was able to meet the deadline set by Maurel. Lloyd then suggested that the offer be taken up by Amcol, notwithstanding the current dispute between the shareholders and the board. Lloyd prepared a proposal for the board of directors of Amcol based on a price of US$39.60m, that is the original price of US$35.85m plus the commission of US$3.75m. The appellant was informed of and agreed to this latest development. The relevant papers were prepared. This included a memorandum dated 10 May 1996, a resolution dated 20 May 1996, and a report entitled `Project Mauritius`. The papers were circulated to the board of directors. Lloyd and Ng also spoke to several of the directors about the project. The board of directors approved Amcol`s participation in the project at the price of US$39.60m for a 40% stake, not knowing that the price had been marked up to include a commission of US$3.75m payable to Lloyd, Ng and the appellant.
 9.Pribadi (PW3), Tang Sui Shing (PW4), Johnny Kesuma (PW6), Rudy Rene Van Capelle (PW7), Bay Yew Chuan (PW8), TT Durai (PW9) and Govinda Gopalan (PW10) were directors of Amcol. They all testified that they had approved Amcol`s participation in the project without knowing that the true price for Amcol`s participation was only US$35.85m. Further, they had been unaware that the inflated price included a commission to be paid to Lloyd, Ng and the appellant. They testified that, had they known this, they would not have approved Amcol`s participation in the project.
 10.The joint venture agreement was executed on 22 May 1996. Amcol made the first payment to Maurel of US$13.62m on 28 May 1996 and the second payment of US$25.98m on 13 June 1996.
 11.Sometime in June 1996, the appellant told Ng that US$300,000 had been remitted to the appellant`s account with Coutts & Co in London. The appellant had also learnt from Lloyd that a similar sum had been credited to Lloyd`s trust account with Standard Chartered Bank. US$300,000 had also been credited to the account of one Thio Swie Ling with Banque Centrale Asia in Indonesia in favour of Ng. Ng subsequently called Maurel who confirmed that he had remitted these sums to their respective accounts.
 12.In early July 1996, Lloyd, Ng and the appellant were concerned with the possibility that the payments of US$300,000 into their respective accounts might be questioned. They met Maurel to discuss the matter. The appellant prepared a document for Maurel to sign. The document was predated 6 May 1996 and read as follows: 
With reference to our many telephone conversations, and our meetings both in Mauritius and Singapore, this is to confirm our agreement; that in the event that you and your company, Group Roland Maurel Ltd, enter into a legally binding agreement with any company or group of companies in the region, including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong, we have agreed that you will pay me a consultancy fee of US$300,000 or 1% of the contract amount, whichever is lesser.
 
For record purposes, I am forwarding you this letter in duplicate, and I would appreciate it if you`d kindly sign and return one copy to me, to signify your understanding and wilful agreement.
 Maurel signed the letter. Lloyd and Ng also prepared similar letters which Maurel also signed. In short, Lloyd`s letter stated that the US$300,000 was paid to Lloyd as a sign up bonus, and Ng`s letter stated that the US$300,000 was paid to Ng for the purchase of an apartment by Ng for Maurel.
 13.In July 1996, Ng went to Bali, where he met Lloyd and the appellant. Lloyd told them that he had been questioned about the US$300,000 which he had received. The three of them agreed to stick to the explanations they had concocted for the receipt of the moneys.
 14.Ng then returned to Singapore. He was questioned by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB)and made a full confession. His confession was consistent with his testimony in court. He pleaded guilty to a charge of cheating under s 418 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and was sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment.
 15.The trial judge found that a prima facie case had been made out against the appellant at the end of the prosecution`s case, and called for the defence.
 16.The appellant gave evidence in his own defence. He was a well known broker in Singapore. He had met Lloyd and Ng at the Tanglin Club on 20 April 1996. Ng told him about the joint venture project in Mauritius. He asked Ng why Amcol had not bought a share in this project. Ng explained that there was a dispute between the shareholders and the board of directors of Amcol and that Amcol could not afford the capital outlay required. The appellant denied that he had proposed that they should receive a commission for finding a third party investor to be shared equally between the three of them.
 17.The appellant had subsequently met Lloyd and Ng for lunch. He was told that Maurel was prepared to pay him a commission if he could find a third party investor for the joint venture project. The appellant indicated that he needed to view the project and followed Lloyd and Ng to Mauritius. Before leaving for Mauritius, he had called the Chief Executive Officer of Magnum Corporation, Malaysia, and informed him of the project. He had not however mentioned the price as he himself had been unaware of the price at this time.
 18.The appellant was introduced to Maurel in Mauritius. He also viewed the sites for the joint venture project. Lloyd told him that Maurel wanted US$36m in return for a 40% share in the project. If the appellant could find an investor who was willing to pay more than US$36m, the excess would be shared between Lloyd, Ng and the appellant.
 19.The appellant returned to Singapore and called the Chief Executive Officer of Magnum. He was asked to speak to the Director of Gaming, who expressed keen interest in the project. He then called Lloyd to inform him of Magnum`s interest in the project. Lloyd informed him that Amcol had decided to invest in the project. He was very angry because his efforts in securing Magnum as an investor had gone to waste and he had been deprived of earning a commission. Moreover, he would have to explain this sudden turn of events to the Chief Executive Officer of Magnum, and he was afraid that this would affect his standing with the company. Lloyd and Ng both assured him that he would still receive his commission. However, Lloyd and Ng did not inform him about the terms and conditions on which Amcol would invest in the project.
 20.Lloyd called him later and told him that he could expect a commission of about US$1.2m. He gave Lloyd the details of his account with Coutts & Co in London, where the money was to be remitted.
 21.Sometime in June 1996, US$300,000 was credited to his account with Coutts & Co. He called Ng and asked about the balance. Ng suggested that he call Maurel. He called Maurel, who said that the appellant would be paid the full amount, but that he would have to be patient as Maurel was short of cash. He decided that Maurel would not be paying him any more money. He asked Maurel for a letter confirming that the US$300,000 that he had received was a commission from Maurel. He wanted this for his records. However, when he met Maurel in Singapore, Maurel said that he had forgotten to bring the letter. He had then prepared a letter for Maurel to sign. He had backdated the letter to 6 May 1996 as that was the time when Lloyd and Ng had assured him that he would receive his commission. Maurel signed the letter.
 22.The appellant met Lloyd and Ng in Bali. Lloyd told him that he had been questioned by Price Waterhouse on the joint venture project, and that Price Waterhouse had also questioned him on the appellant`s involvement in the project. Ng told the appellant that, in the event that he was questioned on the project, he was to say that he had met Maurel in January 1996 when in actual fact the appellant had only met him in April 1996. When the appellant asked Ng why he had to lie, Ng simply said that it would be better that way.
 23.The appellant was subsequently interviewed by the CPIB. He learnt through them that Ng and Lloyd had cheated Amcol by marking up the price of the project and that the US$300,000 he had received had come from Amcol and not Maurel. He had immediately instructed his banker to prepare a draft for US$300,000 in favour of Amcol and handed it over to his solicitors.
 24.
 Decision below
The trial judge found that: (a). the appellant had an agreement with Ng and Lloyd with respect to the joint venture project;
 (b). the agreement was to do an illegal act, namely, to cheat and thereby dishonestly induce Amcol into paying US$39.60m for a 40% share in the joint venture project, when the actual price of the project was only US$35.85m.
 The trial judge accordingly found the appellant guilty of the charge preferred against him and sentenced him to 20 months` imprisonment.
 25.
 The appeal against conviction
The thrust of the appeal was that the trial judge had erred in finding that the appellant had entered into an agreement with Lloyd and Ng to cheat and thereby dishonestly induced Amcol into paying US$39.60m for a share in the joint venture project. Counsel for the appellant contended that, at the very most, the evidence showed that the appellant had agreed to a mark up in the price of the joint venture project, and that this mark up in price would be paid to and shared equally between Lloyd, Ng and the appellant as a commission. The evidence did not show that the appellant had agreed to deceive the board of directors of Amcol into thinking that the price of the joint venture project was US$39.60m, without revealing that the actual price was in fact US$35.85m and that the mark up in price represented a commission to be paid to Lloyd, Ng and the appellant. The trial judge had therefore erred in finding that the evidence adduced by the prosecution was sufficient to make out a prima facie case against the appellant at the close of the prosecution case below, much less sufficient to warrant the appellant`s conviction at the conclusion of the trial.
 26.
 Whether the prosecution succeeded in establishing a prima facie case against the appellant at the close of its case below
At the close of its case during the trial below, the prosecution had to ensure that it had adduced evidence which was not inherently incredible and which, if it were accepted as accurate, would establish each essential element in the offence charged: 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 [1980-1981] SLR 73 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 .
 27.It is convenient at this stage to set out the relevant statutory provisions. Section 120A of the Penal Code reads: 
When two or more persons agree to do, or cause to be done -
 
(a) an illegal act; or 
(b) an act, which is not illegal, by illegal means,
 
such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy:
 
Provided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof.
 The charge against the appellant alleged that he had entered into an agreement to do an illegal act, namely, the offence of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code. Section 420 of the Penal Code reads: 
Whoever 
 cheats
 and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. [Emphasis added].
 Section 415 of the Penal Code reads: 
Whoever, 
 by deceiving
 any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to 
 `cheat`.
[Emphasis added.]
 The upshot of these statutory provisions was that it was essential for the prosecution to prove that the appellant had agreed to an act of deception in order to make out the charge preferred against him.
 28.
 Whether the appellant entered into an agreement to deceive Amcol
The natural and ordinary meaning of the word `deceive` is to cause another to believe what is not true. The deception may take the form of words, acts and even omissions. As Explanation 1 to s 415 makes clear, a dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section. In the instant case, the alleged deception was twofold. First, the board of directors of Amcol was to be told that the price of the joint venture project was US$39.60m, when in fact the actual price was only US$35.85m. Secondly, the board of directors was not to be told that the mark up in price of US$3.75m represented a commission to be paid to and shared between Lloyd, Ng and the appellant.
 29.Counsel for the appellant argued that there was no evidence that the appellant had agreed to such a deception, and that the trial judge had therefore erred in finding that a prima facie case had been made out against him . In my judgment, this contention was spurious. At the close of the prosecution case, the court had before it the following pieces of evidence: (a). The appellant had met with Lloyd and Ng at the Tanglin Club in April 1996. He had said that they should receive a commission for finding a third party investor to be shared equally between the three of them.
 (b). Lloyd had proposed that the three of them should receive a total commission of US$3.75m. This would be incorporated into the price of the project, which would accordingly be marked up US$3.75m to US$39.60m. Ng had informed the appellant about the proposed commission and the mark up in price. The appellant had agreed.
 (c). Lloyd had suggested that the offer be taken up by Amcol. Lloyd had prepared a proposal for the board of directors of Amcol based on a price of US$39.60m, that is the original price of US$35.85m plus the commission of US$3.75m. The appellant had been informed of and agreed to this latest development.
 (d). In early July 1996, the appellant had been concerned that the payment of US$300,000 into his account might be questioned. The appellant prepared a document for Maurel to sign. The document was predated 6 May 1996 and stated that the US$300,000 had been paid to him by Maurel as a consultancy fee.
 30.The evidence showed that the appellant had agreed that a commission of US$3.75m would be paid to and shared between Lloyd, Ng and himself, and that this commission was to be built into the purchase price. The evidence also showed that the appellant had been informed that the project would be offered to Amcol at the inflated price of US$39.60m, and that he had agreed to this. A reasonable inference to be drawn from the appellant`s agreement to the surreptitious way in which the commission was to be built into the purchase price was that (a) the appellant was aware that the purchaser, Amcol, would not be informed of this mark up in price or that the mark up in price represented a commission to be shared between Lloyd, Ng and the appellant, and (b) the appellant had agreed to this. The appellant`s behaviour after receiving the sum of US$300,000 was especially telling. If he had not entered into an agreement with Lloyd and Ng to deceive Amcol, there would have been no need for him to worry about the payment of US$300,000 into his account being questioned. Yet he had gone to great lengths to draw up a letter, predated 6 May 1996, stating that the US$300,000 had been paid to him by Maurel as a consultancy fee, for Maurel to sign. The appellant was obviously anxious to have in hand a legitimate explanation for the receipt of the US$300,000. A reasonable inference to be drawn from the appellant`s behaviour was that he had entered into an agreement to deceive Amcol and was aware that the US$300,000 constituted part of the fruits of this deception.
 31.It should be emphasised that, at the close of the prosecution`s case, the prosecution did not have to go further than to establish that there was evidence, not inherently incredible, from which the court could draw a reasonable inference that there was an agreement between Lloyd, Ng and the appellant to deceive Amcol. As LP Thean JA put it in 
Tan Siew Chay v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
 : 
In considering whether the prosecution has made out a case against the accused, we have to adopt the approach as laid down by Lord Diplock [in 
 Haw Tua Tau
]. We assume (a) that the evidence on the primary facts is true, unless the evidence is inherently incredible, and (b) that there will be nothing to displace the inferences as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation. 
 The application of limb (b) necessarily involves the court drawing inferences from the primary facts, and in drawing such inferences the court looks at the totality of the evidence and considers what inference, if any, that can reasonably be drawn therefrom. But in considering any inference to be drawn the court at this stage does not apply the test whether the evidence looked at in its totality would inevitably and inexorably lead to only one inference or inferences for establishing the essential elements of the charge.
 [Emphasis added.]
 32.Having regard to the foregoing reasons, I found that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the appellant at the close of its case in the trial below, and that the trial judge was correct in calling for his defence.
 33.
 Whether the prosecution succeeded in proving its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt
The version of events given by the appellant differed from the prosecution`s case in the following aspects. He did not suggest that a commission be shared between Lloyd, Ng and himself. It was Ng who told the appellant that he would get a commission if he found a third party investor. The appellant had been told that the price of the project was about US$36m for a 50% share. He denied that Lloyd, Ng and himself agreed to mark up the price of the joint venture project by US$3.75m, and that this money would be paid to and shared between the three of them as a commission. He also denied that he had been told that the project would be offered to Amcol at the inflated price of US$39.60m. The appellant claimed that he had not known the terms and conditions on which Amcol would invest in the project. He had simply been told that he would be paid a commission of US$1.2m. He denied that Lloyd, Ng and himself had been concerned with the possibility that the payment of US$300,000 into their respective accounts might be questioned and that they had met Maurel specifically to discuss the matter. He denied that he had obtained the letter from Maurel predated 6 May 1996 in order to have in hand a legitimate explanation for the US$300,000. He had simply wanted it for his records.
 34.Counsel for the appellant contended that the trial judge erred in preferring the evidence of Ng over that of the appellant. The trial judge failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that Ng was an accomplice and his evidence was therefore suspect. In particular, the trial judge erred in finding that Ng had nothing to gain by testifying against the appellant, as Ng had already pleaded guilty to an offence of cheating under s 418 of the Penal Code and been sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment. I found these contentions to be without merit. Section 116, illustration (b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) states that the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution. There are many reasons why an accomplice`s evidence should be treated with caution. He may bear a personal grudge against the accused and wish to implicate him. He has an insider`s perspective, so that any evidence which he fabricates may be tailored to tally so closely with the facts of the case that it appears to be the truth. Or he may wish to shift a greater part of the blame onto the shoulders of the accused so as to exonerate himself. All that the trial judge was trying to say, when he found that Ng `had nothing to gain` by testifying against the appellant, was that one of the reasons for treating Ng`s evidence with caution was no longer tenable, as Ng had already pleaded guilty and so had nothing to gain in terms of trying to exonerate himself by shifting more of the blame onto the appellant`s shoulders. The trial judge had not found that, simply because Ng had pleaded guilty, his evidence should no longer be treated with caution. On the contrary, the trial judge had expressly stated at [para ] 55 of his grounds of decision that: 
Having considered these factors, 
 having cautioned myself about Ng being an accomplice
 and having seen his demeanour throughout the days he was giving evidence, I was satisfied Ng was a witness of truth. [Emphasis added.]
 Having perused the trial judge`s grounds of decision, I was satisfied that the trial judge had given proper consideration to the fact that Ng was an accomplice, and that his evaluation of Ng`s evidence could not be faulted in this regard.
 35.It is useful at this stage to reiterate the principles governing an appellate court`s role in reviewing the trial judge`s findings of fact. It is settled law that an appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial judge`s findings of fact, especially where they hinge on the trial judge`s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. This is borne out by s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which states that no judgment, sentence or order of a district court or magistrate`s court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case. In 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , FA Chua J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, held at p 719: 
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor.
 Similarly, in the case of 
Tan Chow Soo v Ratna Ammal
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 49
 , in which findings of fact depended on the credibility and veracity of witnesses, Lord Diplock, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, held that an appellate court should be reluctant to overturn findings made by the trial judge because they are in a less advantageous position as compared to the trial judge who has had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the witnesses in full and observing their demeanour. The upshot of these cases is that factual findings of fact are prima facie correct and will not be lightly disturbed in the absence of good reasons. Then again, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual findings which have been ascertained, a different approach will be taken. In such cases, it is again settled law that an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case. With these principles in mind, I turned once again to consider counsel for the appellant`s contention that the trial judge had erred in preferring the evidence of Ng over that of the appellant.
 36.After perusing the notes of evidence, I found that both Ng and the appellant had been subjected to detailed cross-examination during the trial. The district judge had had ample opportunity to observe the witnesses, and their demeanour in the witness box and form his own views as to their credibility. Despite having cautioned himself as to the credibility of Ng, given that Ng was an accomplice, the trial judge was nonetheless satisfied that Ng was a witness of truth. I found nothing in the notes of evidence which would justify interfering with the trial judge`s evaluation of the witnesses` credibility. Indeed, I was of the opinion that it was the appellant`s evidence, if anything, which was unsatisfactory. I found it inconceivable that a broker of the appellant`s experience could have been unaware of the price at which the joint venture project was to be offered to Amcol. I also found it inconceivable that the appellant could have accepted, without any reservations, a commission of US$1.2m when he had done absolutely nothing to procure Amcol`s participation in the joint venture project. The appellant claimed that he had wanted the letter predated 6 May 1996 for his records. Yet he had admitted under cross-examination that he did not usually keep a record of his business dealings and that he had not kept any other records in respect of the joint venture project. It seemed to me far too much of a coincidence to be believable that the appellant should have just happened to choose this particular moment to start keeping a record of his business dealings.
 37.Finally, I turned once again to the question of deception. Counsel for the appellant argued that the trial judge had erred in finding, at the end of the trial, that the appellant had entered into an agreement to deceive Amcol. I have already set out at [para ] 29 the four main items of evidence which existed in this respect at the close of the prosecution`s case. The proper test which should be applied at the end of the trial is as follows: whether these four items of evidence, added together and considered as a whole, lead to the irresistible inference that the appellant entered into an agreement to deceive Amcol (see 
Ang Sunny v PP
 [1965-1968] SLR 67 
 
[1966] 2 MLJ 195
 ). The contentions put forth by counsel for the appellant were twofold. First, the appellant`s story was that items of evidence (a) to (c) had never taken place and were a fabrication by Ng. As for item (d), he had simply wanted the letter predated 6 May 1996 as a record, and no adverse inference should be drawn against him in this respect. However, as I have pointed out above in [para ] 36, the district judge preferred Ng`s evidence over that of the appellant, and I saw no reason to disturb the district judge`s assessment of the witnesses` credibility. And as for item (d), I have already shown at [para ] 36 why the appellant`s explanation is plainly unsatisfactory in the light of his admissions under cross-examination. Secondly, counsel for the appellant argued that these four items of evidence did not lead to the irresistible inference that that the appellant had entered into an agreement to deceive Amcol. As I said in [para ] 30, the reasonable inferences which could be drawn from these four items of evidence were that (a) the appellant was aware that the purchaser, Amcol, would not be informed of the mark up in price or that the mark up in price represented a commission to be shared between Lloyd, Ng and the appellant and (b) the appellant had agreed to this. Apart from a bald assertion that these four items of evidence did not irresistibly lead to the abovementioned inferences, there was nothing in counsel for the appellant`s submissions to displace these inferences. After considering the cumulative effect of these four items of evidence, I was satisfied that no reasonable inference could be drawn from them other than those mentioned above. As such, I was of the view that the four items of evidence set out in [para ] 29, added together and taken as a whole, led to the irresistible inference that the appellant had entered into an agreement to deceive Amcol.
 38.For the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that the trial judge was fully entitled to find, at the end of the trial, that the charge against the appellant had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and I accordingly dismissed the appeal against conviction.
 39.
 The appeal against sentence
Section 120B of the Penal Code provides that, if there is a conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for a term of two years or more, the party to the conspiracy shall be punished as if he had abetted the offence. The charge against the appellant alleged that the appellant was party to a conspiracy to commit an offence of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code. The sentence prescribed for an offence of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code is mandatory imprisonment of up to seven years and the offender is liable to a fine. The appellant was therefore liable to be punished as if he had abetted the offence of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code. Section 109 of the Penal Code provides that, if the ultimate offence is actually committed, the punishment for abetment is the same as that for the ultimate offence. In the instant case, the offence of cheating under s 420 was actually carried out. The upshot of these provisions therefore was that the appellant was liable for a term of imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine.
 40.The trial judge took into consideration the following factors: (a). the conspiracy was to cheat Amcol of the considerable sum of US$3.75m;
 (b). the need for consistency of sentences for co-conspirators, bearing in mind that Ng had been sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment;
 (c). the fact that the appellant had previously been convicted of an offence of cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code and an offence of theft under s 380 of the Penal Code;
 (d). the fact the Ng and Lloyd had clearly been more culpable than the appellant;
 (e). the fact that the appellant had returned the US$300,000 to Amcol.
 In the result, he sentenced the appellant to 20 months` imprisonment. Counsel for the appellant contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive, given that Ng had clearly played a greater role in the conspiracy than the appellant and yet had only been sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment. It should be noted however that Ng had pleaded guilty to a lesser offence of cheating under s 418, which carried a maximum sentence of only three years` imprisonment. The appellant was charged with being a party to a conspiracy to commit an offence of cheating under s 420 and faced a maximum sentence of seven years` imprisonment. Ng had fully co-operated with the authorities on this matter, whereas the appellant had elected to claim trial. Moreover, Ng had no criminal antecedents, whereas the appellant had had two previous convictions, one of which was for a similar offence of cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code. I noted that the trial judge had taken into account all the relevant mitigating factors in meting out the sentence. I also took note of the considerable sum involved - US$3.75m. In these circumstances, I did not find the sentence of 20 months` imprisonment to be manifestly excessive.

 Introduction
The accused was tried in the court below on one charge of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The charge read as follows: 
You, Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdul Kadir Alhadad
 
M/46 years, NRIC No 0073282/F
 
are charged that you, on or about 29 May 1993, in Singapore, did cheat one Azam Ali, a director of one Scan Electronics (S) Pte Ltd, by deceiving him into believing that a commission of S$50,000 was payable to an agent as the agent`s commission for the sale of a property known as No 13 Jalan Besar to the said Scan Electronics (S) Pte Ltd, when no such payment was payable as no agent was involved in the sale, and by that deception you dishonestly induced the said Azam Ali to deliver S$50,000 to you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 The appellant was convicted and sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment at the end of the trial and ordered to pay prosecution costs of $21,142 to the Commercial Affairs Department. He appealed against his conviction. I dismissed his appeal for the reasons given below.
 2.
 The prosecution`s case
The prosecution`s main witness was Azam Ali, (Azam), the person who had been cheated, and it was his version of events that formed the basis of their case. Azam testified that sometime in April/May 1993, he, on behalf of his company, Scan Electronics had shown interest in a shophouse at No 13 Jalan Besar (the property). As such, he testified that he had first called the appellant at the direction of one Syed Salim Alhadad (Salim) whose name he had found after conducting a title search on the title deeds of the Property at the Registry of Deeds. Azam first contacted the appellant by telephone and arranged a meeting with him. As it was his first dealing with property, Azam brought a friend along, Junaideen Mohamed Ashroff (Ashroff) for support. The price and the decision to sell were not discussed at this meeting. All this was corroborated by the testimony of Ashroff, who added that he was not involved in the purchase of the property after this meeting and that there were only three of them present at this meeting. Azam testified that the appellant did not tell him what his capacity was in dealing with the property.
 3.A second meeting took place with the appellant and two of the appellant`s brothers and uncle, namely Syed Hashim, Syed Ibrahim Alhadad (Ibrahim) and Salim, along with two other persons. Again, nothing was confirmed, but Azam told the appellant that the property was to be bought by his company, Scan Electronics. A few days later, the appellant told Azam by telephone that the purchase price was $550,000 and that there was an agent`s commission of $50,000 to be paid. Azam testified that the impression given to him by the appellant was that there would be no deal if the $50,000 fee was not paid.
 4.Subsequently, Azam called up the appellant to confirm that he was agreeable to the deal including the payment of the $50,000 commission despite his fellow director, Chow Kwok Seng`s (Chow) reservations about having to pay what was considered a high commission. This was done at a meeting at a restaurant in Arab Street on 18 May 1993 where only the appellant, Azam, Ibrahim and some other brothers of the appellant were present. Azam then received a `temporary option` but was told that another option would be issued to him upon the payment of the $50,000. There was no agent present at the meeting and, again, the appellant did not say who the agent was.
 5.The next time Azam met up with the appellant was at the appellant`s house at Lorong Marzuki on 29 May 1993. Chow accompanied Azam to this meeting after they had both cashed a cheque of $50,000 drawn on Scan Electronics` account. This was done as the appellant had earlier specified that the payment should be in cash. Azam and Chow waited for some time in the verandah outside the house for the appellant who came in from the main gate. One of them then put the envelope containing the cash on the table that they were all sitting around. The agent was not present at this time. Later on, Syed Abdullah bin Alwi Alhadad (Abdullah), the alleged agent, arrived at the house through the main gate. The appellant then went into the house and brought out a piece of typed paper (P12) which constituted a receipt for the payment of the $50,000. As the paper said nothing about Azam getting back the money if the deal did not go through, Azam asked the appellant what would happen in those circumstances. The appellant then wrote the handwritten portion of P12.
 6.Azam testified that he had never met Abdullah before and therefore there was no arrangement between himself and Abdullah that Abdullah was to act as Azam`s agent in this deal. The appellant had also not explained to Azam what capacity the appellant was acting in with regard to this deal. Azam added that he believed that the handwritten portion was a guarantee by the appellant that the appellant would return the money if the deal did not go through.
 7.Azam went on to state that, although he had calculated that $600,000 was a good price to pay for the property, if he had known that there was actually no vendor`s agent involved, he would obviously not have been willing to pay the $50,000 agent`s commission.
 8.As regards the document P12, Azam understood the word `I` found in it to refer to the appellant and not the agent in respect to the guarantee of repayment of the $50,000 in the event that the sale fell through. He reiterated that on 29 May 1993, he did not know that there was no agent involved. He only became aware of the scam when he came to court. To date, he has not made any demand for repayment of the $50,000 from the appellant.
 9.It was established further that a payment voucher (P19) was issued by Scan Electronics to show that Azam had withdrawn the company`s money to pay the commission. Azam denied that the $50,000 was a bribe given to facilitate the purchase of the property, adding that in 1993 he did not have much experience in the sale and purchase of property. However, as managing director of Scan Electronics, he was assigned the task of looking for a suitable property for their office premises. Azam also explained why the $50,000 appeared in the company`s account as a director`s fee payable to himself rather than as commission. This was done as Chow had expressed reservations about the payment of this sum. Thus, Azam decided to take the risk of it on himself in the event that the sale fell through.
 10.The district judge found that there was nothing sinister about this as a payment voucher was raised to evidence the arrangement with the company. A director`s resolution was also passed to approve this payment.
 11.Chow`s evidence basically corroborated the evidence of Azam. Chow testified that Azam was in charge of the purchase of the property and confirmed that a cheque of $20,000 was made out by the company to Ibrahim. Chow added that he had not met the appellant apart from 29 May 1993 at the appellant`s house. His version of events matched that of Azam`s regarding what had taken place at Lorong Marzuki where the $50,000 was paid to the appellant. Chow said that upon seeing the receipt for the $50,000, both he and Azam felt that the words were not sufficient to protect their interest and thus he requested for the name and identity card number of the agent to be written down as well, reiterating that that this was done by the appellant. It was only after being given the receipt that he was introduced to the alleged agent, Abdullah. Chow clarified that this was the first time that he met Abdullah. Chow also added that their company had been willing to pay $600,000 for the property and found the price acceptable.
 12.The other key witness in the prosecution`s case was Abdullah who is the first cousin of the appellant. The evidence that the prosecution relied on for its case was found in P15 which was a transcript of a statement given by Abdullah to the investigating officer in October 1995. In this statement, Abdullah gave a version of the events that took place on 29 May 1993 that corresponded with Azam and Chow`s testimonies. This included never having met either of them prior to the meeting at the appellant`s house on 29 May 1993 and never being handed the $50,000.
 13.At the trial, however, Abdullah gave evidence-in-chief that differed materially from the statement he made to the investigating officer. He said that he met Azam some time in February 1993 at the appellant`s office where Azam informed him that he was very interested in the property. Azam then offered him $50,000 as a commission fee. Abdullah thus said that he arranged for Azam to meet Ibrahim. Apart from this, he did nothing else.
 14.On 29 May 1993, Abdullah said that he met Azam again at the appellant`s office and asked for the commission fee of $50,000 from Azam. However, Azam said that he wanted the appellant to witness the payment and thus Azam and Abdullah drove to the appellant`s house together. Abdullah claimed that the appellant was not aware that Abdullah was going to receive the $50,000 until Abdullah told him at Lorong Marzuki. Abdullah said that he asked the appellant to be a witness to the payment and that the appellant wrote the handwritten portion on P12 as he was the witness. Abdullah signed P12 and collected the money from Azam upon which Abdullah counted the money and left. He claimed that he spent the money and did not bank it into any account. He added that he was not involved in any further dealing with the property. Abdullah stated that he had lied deliberately in his statement to the investigating officer, as he was worried that he would have to return the money.
 15.The DPP applied to impeach Abdullah`s credit under s 157 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) due to the material discrepancies between his earlier statement P15 and his evidence-in-chief. This was done and Abdullah`s statement in P15 was admitted as evidence pursuant to the principles set out in the case of 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
 .
 16.
 The decision below
The trial judge held that there were no substantive legal issues in dispute in this case and the outcome was based on the finding of fact.
 17.The trial judge stated that he was inclined to believe Azam`s testimony for several reasons. First, Azam`s behaviour during cross-examination by the defence counsel was a strong factor in influencing the judge that he was a truthful witness. Furthermore, the trial judge was unable to detect any serious inconsistencies or malice in Azam`s evidence that might have suggested that he was inclined to pervert the course of justice. If there were inconsistencies, the trial judge felt that these were more attributable to the lack of foresight and good judgment rather than a basic lack of honesty or integrity as a witness.
 18.The trial judge also considered that neither Chow nor Azam were the complainants against the appellant in the first place. Azam in fact testified that he was not aware that the agency agreement was a scam until the Commercial Affairs Department looked into the case. Thus, the trial judge felt that there were no reasons to contend that Azam, and much less Chow, had given misleading accounts of the matter in order to falsely victimise the appellant.
 19.The trial judge also placed weight on the fact that in the appellant`s version of events, Azam asked him to act as a guarantor and witness of the payment of the $50,000 to Abdullah. This did not sit well with the appellant`s other suggestion that the $50,000 was a bribe or that the payment was tainted with a corrupt motive. This series of facts as asserted by the appellant thus did not make any sense and Azam`s evidence was preferred. Also, Azam had declared the $50,000 received as director`s fees for 1992 in his income tax returns.
 20.The trial judge therefore found that, while Azam was probably enthusiastic about purchasing the property and thus vulnerable to unscrupulous practices, he did not strike the judge as the malicious sort who would fabricate evidence to victimise the appellant. The trial judge was thus satisfied that Azam had given good evidence.
 21.The trial judge also found Chow`s testimony credible. His evidence shed light on the reasons why Azam proceeded with the purchase of the property even though the purchase price was $600,000 in total, as well as confirming Azam`s version of what took place on 29 May 1993. The same view was also taken of Ashroff`s evidence as there was no reason for him to lie, seeing that he had nothing to gain from not telling the truth.
 22.On the other hand, the trial judge found the appellant`s account of the events of 29 May 1993 totally unconvincing. No evidence was tendered of the documents that he was supposed to sign at this meeting which he claimed was the reason why Azam wanted to see him. Also the trial judge felt that it was inexplicable why the appellant, rather than anyone else, should pen the handwritten portion of the receipt. The trial judge was also unable to believe that the appellant should be so concerned for Azam`s welfare as to be grievously upset that Azam had to pay the $50,000 commission fee. Furthermore, the trial judge was unable to make any sense of the appellant`s actions in trying to get Scan Electronics to abort the sale rather than to confront Abdullah, the alleged agent, about it. As such, the trial judge did not find the appellant to be a creditworthy witness. Apart from these inconsistencies in the appellant`s testimony, his body language and awkward lapses of silence during his cross-examination also influenced the trial judge to conclude that he was lying about his actual involvement in the matter.
 23.The trial judge was also unable to believe the evidence given by the other two defence witnesses, Syed Ahmad and Salim, due to the uncanny similarity of the words and phrases used in their conditional statement. He thus found that these statements were more likely than not given in order to buttress the appellant`s testimony on account that they were related to each other.
 24.Finally, the trial judge preferred Abdullah`s statement to the investigating officer found in P15 as evidence of the facts stated therein pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. Citing Yong Pung How CJ in the case of 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
, he found that the evidence given in the inconsistent statement of Abdullah should be given greater weight as the statement had been made closer in time to the material event. Furthermore, the significance of the $50,000 was unknown to Abdullah at the time and thus his narration of the events that took place on 29 May 1993 was less likely to be tainted by the fact that he might be tailoring his evidence to help the appellant. A key factor here was the fact that his version of events in the recorded statement was consistent with the evidence of the prosecution witnesses in respect of the events that took place on 29 May 1993. Additionally, his allegation that he was harassed during the interview with the investigating officer could not be established after the tape recording of the interview was played in court. Therefore, the evidence in the recorded statement was admissible.
 25.As regards Abdullah`s evidence in court, the trial judge found it hard to believe that, according to Abdullah himself, for doing virtually nothing with regard to the sale of the property apart from arranging for Azam to meet Ibrahim, he received $50,000 as an agent`s commission. Furthermore, this was rendered even more unbelievable by the fact that his relatives would have stood by and not protested at his receiving this huge sum of $50,000 for doing virtually nothing.
 26.Therefore, the trial judge found that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, save Abdullah`s, was more believable than that of the defence witnesses. The evidence tendered by the prosecution was thus sufficient to make out the offence of cheating against the appellant, punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code. As the appellant had not raised a reasonable doubt against the prosecution`s case, he was duly convicted and sentenced.
 27.
 Application to adduce fresh evidence in the appeal
During the hearing of the appeal, the appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence of a transcript of a conversation that he allegedly had with Ashroff on 3 April 1998. He asserted that this conversation revealed that Azam and Ashroff had not been truthful about material matters that led to the appellant`s conviction. The appellant further submitted that the conversation had revealed that the $50,000 had been received by Ibrahim and that Azam had known what the true deal was about and therefore could not have been cheated.
 28.In his submissions, counsel for the appellant cited 
 Palmer & Palmer v R 
 (1979) 50 CCC (2d) 193 and 
Stafford v DPP
 
[1973] 58 Cr App R 256
 as authorities to show that, where fresh evidence which was credible and capable of belief and had not been available at the trial emerged, and would have affected the outcome of the trial, it should be admitted.
 29.In my opinion, the principles to be applied in deciding if the fresh evidence may be adduced in a magistrate`s appeal were set out in the case of 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
 . In this case it was made clear that s 268(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) states that the court may order the taking of additional evidence in accordance with s 257(1) of the CPC. Section 257(1) reads as follows: 
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court of Magistrate`s Court.
 The main question here was whether the evidence was `necessary`. In that case, I applied the case of 
Rajendra Prasad v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 1
 , a case dealing with s 55(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 332) which is materially similar to s 257(1) of the CPC. This case stated that the principles encapsulated in the case of 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 3 All ER 745
 should be observed. According to Denning LJ, three conditions must be satisfied; first, the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; thirdly, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
 30.I stated in 
 Juma`at 
`s case that the circumstances in which an application to introduce fresh evidence will be allowed are extremely limited as the case of 
 R 
 v Stafford 
 (1969) 53 Cr App R I explained that public mischief would ensue and the legal process could become indefinitely prolonged if it were the case that evidence produced at any time will generally be admitted by this court when verdicts are being reviewed. Hallet J in 
R v Jordan
 
[1956] 40 Cr App R 152
 earlier said that it is only in the most exceptional circumstances and subject to what may be described as exceptional conditions that the court is ever willing to listen to additional evidence. This attitude was followed by the local courts. I added further that the evidence to be considered should enable a glaring injustice to be corrected saying that 
This is warranted only by the most extenuating circumstances and may include the fact that the offence is a serious one attracting grave consequences and the fact that the additional evidence sought to be adduced was highly cogent and pertinent and the strength of which rendered the conviction unsafe.
 31.Relying on these principles, it would seem that the first condition was satisfied in this case as the facts on which the evidence was based arose only after the trial was over, apparently sometime in April 1998. However, I did not feel that the second and third conditions had been satisfied. According to the appellant, the taped conversation showed that he was not guilty of the offence of cheating as convicted, and that the allegations on which basis he was convicted were perpetrated by others. I found it difficult to tell for sure what the appellant and Ashroff were talking about based on the transcript as it is appeared disjointed and unclear. As such, even if the evidence was to be admitted, I doubted it would have a significant influence on the outcome of the case. Also, the credibility of the evidence was open to dispute as the authenticity of the tape had not been proved. Additional evidence should not be admitted unless it may be accepted as apparently credible without the need for further proof. I was thus of the opinion that there was no substance in this application to adduce this piece of additional evidence which I suspected was done so to delay proceedings further. Thus, this application was dismissed.
 32.
 Appeal against conviction
The main thrust of the appellant`s appeal was that the version of events given by Azam, Chow and Ashroff was not correct and that the trial judge should have believed the appellant`s version as it told the truth of the matter.
 33.
 The appellant`s version of events
In his defence at the trial, the appellant said that in April 1993, one of the trustees of the property, his uncle Salim, told him that Azam was interested in buying the property and asked the appellant to deal with his enquiry. Thus a first meeting took place at the appellant`s office on that occasion. The appellant said that at this meeting, a price of $550,000 was offered to Azam for the property. The appellant alleged that he told the two trustees to deal with Azam themselves as the appellant was not involved with the trust.
 34.After this, the second meeting took place between the appellant, Salim, Azam and Ashroff where further negotiations took place. The offer price by the appellant and the trustee remained at $550,000. A third meeting took place again between the appellant, Azam and Salim but nothing was resolved despite the negotiations. Thereafter, on 19 May 1993, the appellant was told that Ibrahim had granted the option to purchase the property to Azam for the sum of $20,000. However, the true option was only to be handed over to Azam after he had paid the $50,000 commission to the agent.
 35.On 29 May 1993, Azam and Chow went to the appellant`s house as the appellant was told by the other trustees that there were some other documents to sign relating to the Property. When the appellant came out of his house, amongst those present were Azam, Chow and Abdullah. It was at this meeting that the appellant allegedly first found out about the existence of the agent and the fee to be paid to the agent. He then told Azam that the sum to be paid was too high as the maximum sum paid for agent`s commission was normally two to three percent of the price of the property. However, Azam said that `Mr Jafar already agreed lah.` The agreement and receipt P12 was signed by Abdullah and upon Chow and Azam`s insistence, the appellant wrote in an additional paragraph in P12 stating that, if the sale was aborted, the commission would be returned. The appellant then said that Abdullah took the money and went off. The appellant reiterated that he did not ask Azam for the $50,000. He insisted that he only came to know of the $50,000 agent`s commission when they came to his house on 29 May 1993. He also added that he did not know if the trustee had appointed Abdullah as the agent and that, prior to 29 May 1993, he did not know that Abdullah was the agent.
 36.Subsequently the option was exercised by Scan Electronics and the sale was completed on 15 October 1993. The appellant added that he had later tried to get Azam to rescind the contract as he felt that the agent`s commission was suspicious and excessive.
 37.The appellant said that he had made it clear to Azam that he had no authority to sell the property at the second meeting between the parties. He also tried to distance himself from the transaction. However, at the same time, he admitted to doing things such as issuing the receipt for $20,000 paid to Ibrahim for the option money paid by Azam to Ibrahim.
 38.The appellant said that he was not able to give a precise reason why he thought that Abdullah was Azam`s appointed agent. It also transpired that while the appellant said that he was trying to help Azam as he felt that the $50,000 payment was too high and wanted to make sure that Azam`s interests were protected, he did not advise Azam to withhold payment until the sale was completed that day as he did not want to antagonise his family members and spoil the sale. He reiterated that he did not draft P12. However, despite his reservations, he said that he did not approach Abdullah to ask him about the $50,000. He only spoke to Salim about it who told him not to be concerned about the matter.
 39.The defence also relied on the testimonies of Syed Ahmad and Salim which were given by way of conditional statements. Their statements largely confirmed the appellant`s version of events.
 40.
 The appellant`s reasons why his version of events should be believed
Counsel for the appellant submitted that there were several reasons why the trial judge should have believed his story instead of the prosecution witnesses`. The appellant`s first ground of appeal lay in the fact that Azam and Chow had asserted that, although they found the $50,000 agent`s fee too high, they found the overall price of $600,000 fair and thus proceeded with the sale. On this basis, the appellant stated that the agent`s commission neither induced nor deterred them from purchasing the property. Further, since the $50,000 would be returned to Azam if the sale was aborted, there was no element of cheating involved.
 41.The appellant also contended that as P12 represented a guarantee by the appellant to Azam that he would personally pay Azam back his $50,000 in the event that the sale fell through, it was irrelevant whether Azam had actually paid the $50,000 to an agent. Counsel for the appellant then referred to the case of 
 PP v Vedantam 
 AIR 1952 SC 183 to support his contention that there was no deception of Azam as he was not induced to pay the $50,000 by the appellant. Whether the sale was successful or not, there would be no loss caused to Azam as he was willing to pay the total of $600,000 for the roperty and P12 was entered into to safeguard the interest of Azam. As Azam did not feel cheated, he could not have been deceived and the necessary elements of cheating could not be made out.
 42.The appellant`s above contention could not stand in logic. For the offence of cheating according to s 415 which defines it, three elements must be fulfilled. There must be a deception by the accused done fraudulently or dishonestly which induced the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person. The appellant here did not seem to see the point that it does not matter whether Azam was willing to pay $600,000 in total or not. After all, in his mind, he could have been willing to pay $5m for the property. All that was crucial was that Azam was induced by the representation of the appellant that an agent`s fee had to be paid, to pay over the $50,000 to the appellant when it was not true that he had to do that as a pre-condition to the purchase of the property. It did not matter if other considerations also influenced Azam and Chow in their decision to purchase the property. This was made patently clear from the case of 
Chow Dih v PP
 
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 197
  
[1990] SLR 203
 where Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was) said that the correct principle of law was that if the victim at the time when he transferred the goods, was influenced by the false pretence, and would not have transferred the goods but for his reliance upon it, it was immaterial that he may have had additional reasons for making the transfer.
 43.This principle is given further credence by the case of 
R v Lince
 
[1873] 12 Cox CC 451
 where it was decided that the fact that the false pretence was not the only reason why the victim parted with his property was quite immaterial. This case was cited in 
 Gour`s Penal Code of India 
 as good law and thus it was clear that it was sufficient that the complainant was partly and materially, though not entirely, influenced by the false pretences of the accused.
 44.Based on Azam`s version of events, the appellant`s contention could not stand. According to Azam, the appellant represented to him that he would have to pay $50,000 as an agent`s fee and the impression received by Azam was that this was a pre-condition for the sale of the property. This turned out to be false as Abdullah`s statement to the investigating officer showed that he was not the agent. No one else could be identified as the agent. This pre-condition induced Azam to pay the $50,000 to the appellant who had carried out the deception with a dishonest intention. `Dishonesty` is defined by ss 23 and 24 of the Penal Code as intending to cause wrongful loss or to acquire wrongful gain. This element was clearly satisfied by the appellant`s wrongful gain of the $50,000.
 45.Thus, it made absolutely no difference to the offence that the $50,000 would be paid back to Azam in the event that the sale fell through as the appellant contended. On the flip side, if the purchase went through successfully, the $50,000 would not be returned. Azam testified that he would not have been willing to pay the total cost of $600,000 if he had known that the $50,000 payment need not have been made due to the non-existence of an agent.
 46.The appellant went on to assert that, if he had intended to cheat, he would not have written the hand-written portions of P12. This fact showed that he had nothing to hide from those present at the meeting including Azam and Chow. Again, I could not agree with the appellant. The guarantee given by the appellant did not detract from the fact that he had dishonestly represented falsely to Azam that $50,000 had to be paid as commission fee before the deal could go through. The offence of cheating was still made out.
 47.I was also of the opinion that it did not matter what P12 dealt with. The crux of the charge of cheating was that the appellant falsely represented to Azam that in order for Azam to purchase the property successfully, an agent`s fee of $50,000 would have to be paid. Clearly if Azam had known that there was no agent or a fee involved, he would not have been willing to pay the sum total of $600,000. He had been falsely led to believe that the extra sum would have to be paid to an agent.
 48.The appellant`s second argument was that an adverse inference should be drawn against Azam for several reasons: (a). The appellant contended that Azam could not be heard to say in court that he had only realised that the effect of P12 was that Azam would be appointing an agent and paying him $50,000, the day before his evidence-in-chief. This was so because P12 quite clearly stated that Azam was appointing an agent and Azam should have understood it, given the clarity of the words used. However, I was of the opinion that this should not lead to an adverse inference being drawn against Azam. He had explained what he meant when this question was put to him by the defence counsel. He said that as far as he was concerned there was no agent for him, but that the appellant had brought the agent, Abdullah to him and asked Azam to pay the agent. This explanation fitted the tenor of the agreement in P12.
 (b). The appellant also contended that an adverse inference should be drawn against Azam as he said that he only realised that the agreement P12 was a sham when the Commercial Affairs Department brought the prosecution. The appellant said that, if there was a scam, Azam should have realised it on 29 May 1993 as there would be no need for P12 to contain Azam`s name, unless he knew of the arrangement and that he was paying the $50,000 as commission. I did not see why Azam should have realised that it was a scam on 29 May 1993 as the document P12 was a receipt for the $50,000 paid as the alleged commission fee. This fitted with the fact that the deception practised on Azam was one where he would have to pay the $50,000 before the sale could go through. It did not change the fact that Azam was induced to pay the money by the representation of the appellant that this had to be done.
 (c). The third reason given by the appellant for drawing the adverse inference against Azam was that he had not demanded the $50,000 from the appellant as yet. However, I felt that this could not lead the court to disbelieve Azam`s version of events as there could be other reasons that he might have had for not yet claiming the money back from the appellant. Without further explanation, this could not lead the court to draw an adverse inference immediately.
 49.The appellant also contended that the source of the $50,000 was a ground for suspicion. However, I was unable to see the direct relevance of the source of the $50,000 and the arrangement that Azam made with his company Scan Electronics, to the question as to whether Azam was cheated into paying the $50,000 as agent fee. Thus, there was no merit in asserting that an adverse inference should be drawn against Azam.
 50.The appellant further submitted that the trial judge should have attached more weight in favour of the appellant to the fact that there was no complaint by Azam against him. This should not be a reason to prefer the appellant`s evidence over that of Azam as Azam had made it clear that he was unaware up to the time of the trial that the agency agreement was a scam. This did not, as the appellant contended, show that Azam was evasive. Azam said that whether he felt cheated depended on whether it was found that an agent existed. Taking the appellant`s word for it, Azam believed that such an agent did exist, in which case he would not feel cheated. Only if there was no agent would Azam feel that he had been cheated. His answers in court therefore did not show that he knew that he was not deceived by the appellant as claimed by the appellant.
 51.The appellant asserted that the trial judge should not have found that the appellant`s concern that Azam had paid such a high commission fee was mystifying as compared to the fact that the appellant did not care that Azam was paying $100,000 more than the actual valuation of the property. This was because the $100,000 would go to the trust and benefit it and the appellant placed the interests of the trust first. However the $50,000 would not go to the trust and was being paid to a third party. Thus, he was entitled to show concern for Azam out of the goodness of his heart.
 52.I could not accept this submission of the appellant. The trial judge did not base his evaluation simply on the ground submitted by the appellant. What he found mystifying was the fact that despite the appellant`s concern for Azam, the appellant did not seek an explanation from his cousin Abdullah regarding the money first, as he had asserted that Abdullah had taken the money away on 29 May 1993. Instead, his attempts to find out who took the money consisted of trying to get Azam to cancel the sale, a much more complicated and unnecessary way as compared to asking Abdullah about it. Thus, the appellant`s contention could not succeed.
 53.The appellant submitted that the trial judge should have put more weight on Abdullah`s reasons for lying in his statement to the investigating officer. I was of the opinion that the trial judge did consider his reasons but that there was so much other material evidence on which he relied in accepting the statement in P15 as containing the truth of the matter. For example, the trial judge pointed to the relative contemporaneity of the statement being closer in time to the material event and the fact that Abdullah would be more likely to give an accurate account of events as he was not aware of the significance of the $50,000 then. Furthermore, his account of events in P15 was consistent with Azam and Chow`s accounts. Seeing that there was no reason for Abdullah to be in cahoots with them, there would also be no reason for him to tell untruths to the investigating officer. The trial judge clearly specified that on all accounts, he accepted Abdullah`s statement in P15 as being reasonably true of what transpired at Lorong Marzuki which could be admitted as evidence on the authority of 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
. I saw no reason to differ from the trial judge`s conclusion on this matter.
 54.The appellant further asserted that he had answered all questions, particularly the question `Whose agent was Abdullah` put to him by the DPP, to the best of his knowledge and belief at the relevant time. This was based on Azam`s gestures and answers when the appellant asked him who the agent was. The appellant himself did not know who the agent was and thus, this supplemented his defence that he did not represent to Azam that Abdullah was the agent.
 55.The relevant extract of the appellant`s account was set out in the trial judge`s grounds of decision. I saw no reason to differ from his finding that the appellant was rather evasive. When asked directly how he came to the conclusion that Abdullah was appointed by Azam as agent, if Azam had not told him this directly, the appellant did not answer the question at all. Only when pressed further by the DPP did the appellant give an answer based on his own presumption. Furthermore, the trial judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanour of the appellant during this cross-examination. Thus, I was unconvinced by the appellant`s submission on this point.
 56.It is settled law that, where there is an appeal based on fact, the court should be slow to overturn the trial judge`s finding of fact especially when the trial judge has made an assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witness, unless it can be shown that his assessment was plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence before him. In the case of 
Tan Chow Soo v Ratna Ammal
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 49
 , Lord Diplock stated that, as the trial judge has heard all the evidence of the witnesses in full, his findings should be taken as prima facie correct and would not be lightly disturbed in the absence of good reasons. The above principles have been reiterated in a plethora of local cases such as 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , 
Ng Kwee Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 205
  and 
Terence Yap Giau Beng v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
 .
 57.I would not wish to add more to the statements of law laid out above except to reiterate that there is an extremely heavy burden cast onto the appellant to displace the trial judge`s findings of fact. The trial judge`s findings will not be overturned unless it can be shown that the trial judge was horribly wrong in drawing his conclusions. This was not apparent here for the reasons set out above in response to the appellant`s contentions and the trial judge`s own reasons which could be supported both by the notes of evidence and logic. The appellant had failed to show why the version of facts should be anything else but that found by the trial judge. As such, the offence had been proved beyond reasonable doubt and the conviction should stand.
 58.
 Conclusion
As there was no reason to overturn the trial judge`s findings of fact which was the main thrust of the appellant`s case, I dismissed the appeal and upheld the appellant`s conviction and sentence.",1998-09-07 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This was a petition for criminal revision of a decision of a subordinate court and an appeal against the sentence imposed. The application for revision was dismissed, but the appeal was allowed. I now give my reasons for the decision.
 2.
 The facts
The petitioner pleaded guilty in the subordinate court to the following charge: 
You, Ngian Chin Boon, Male 34 Years, FIN No F 1561151 X, Nationality: Malaysian, B 119 Jln Sekolah Cina 81000 Kulai, are charged that you, on or about 20 January 1998 at about 4.43am, at Pan Island Expressway in front of Victoria School towards Jurong, Singapore, did an act so negligently as to endanger human life, to wit, by failing to ensure that sufficient warning signs were carried and displayed behind the stationary motor lorry YB 7373 X by your driver, one Muthuvadu Ganathan Ganesan, male 26 years while carrying out the work and subsequently resulted the driver of motor car EP 8116 D, Azhar Bin Ali, male 26 years to collide into the rear of the motor lorry and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 336 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 Section 336 of the Penal Code provides that: 
[w]hoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine which may extend to $250, or with both.
 3.The plea of guilt was made to a statement of facts, which the petitioner admitted without qualification. In summary, it stated that on 20 January 1998, at about 4.10am, the petitioner, while working at Temasek Boulevard, instructed his driver, one Muthuvadu Ganathan Ganesan, to proceed to the Pan Island Expressway (Kolam Ayer) in front of Victoria School towards Jurong to remove a plastic wrapping dangling from the overhead Electronic Road Pricing gantry. The petitioner`s driver left for the site immediately, arriving there at about 4.35am. He parked his lorry on the second right lane of the Expressway beneath the overhead gantry to remove the plastic wrapping. He failed to display sufficient warning signs to forewarn other road users of the presence of the stationary lorry on the road. Subsequently, a car EP 8116 D collided into the rear of the stationary lorry. The driver of the car died as a result of the accident. The statement of facts alleged that the petitioner had done an act endangering human life by `failing to ensure that sufficient warning signs were carried and displayed behind the stationary motor lorry by his driver during the process of the work and subsequently resulted the driver of the motor car to collide into the rear of the motor lorry`.
 4.In the plea in mitigation, defence counsel submitted that a custodial sentence should not be imposed. It was pointed out, inter alia, that the petitioner had been instructed by Philips Consortium to send workers to remove the plastic wrapping on the day in question, and had been told that the work had to be done urgently. There were no available signboards at that time which the petitioner could have provided the driver. The petitioner had, however, managed to find a revolving light which he gave to the driver.
 5.The district judge considered that there had been `callous negligence` on the part of the petitioner in sending his workers to the site without the requisite warning signs to be placed behind the stationary lorry to forewarn other road users of the presence of the vehicle. A deterrent sentence was thought to be appropriate so as to prevent the petitioner as well as others from committing similar offences in the future. The district judge took the view that even the maximum fine of $250 would not suffice to manifest the stand of the court and achieve the intended purpose of deterrence. As a result, the petitioner was sentenced to two months` imprisonment.
 6.
 The petition for criminal revision
The petitioner sought revision of his conviction, claiming that there had been a serious miscarriage of justice in convicting him on the charge preferred against him. It was contended that the charge was flawed since the petitioner had never been at the Pan Island Expressway at 4.43am on 20 January 1998. It was also contended that the statement of facts, although containing an adequate summary of the material facts, did not disclose any offence under s 336 of the Penal Code. Counsel submitted that the petitioner`s failure to provide his driver with any warning signs or lights other than the one revolving light which he had managed to find was not so negligent as to give rise to criminal liability under this section. A conviction based on the facts set out in the statement of facts would result in the petitioner being made vicariously liable for his driver`s negligence. The petitioner did not oversee the operation of removing the plastic wrapper; neither was he informed of the exact lane on the expressway over which the plastic wrapper was dangling. Thus, the fact that sufficient warning signs were not carried and displayed behind the stationary lorry was the sole responsibility of the driver.
 7.The revisionary powers of the High Court under s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) are to be exercised sparingly. The principles governing revision were laid down in 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
 , where it was held that: 
various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
 These guidelines were recently reaffirmed in 
 Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v PP 
 (MA No 169 of 1998, Crim Rev No 16 of 1998, unreported), where the High Court reiterated that on a petition for revision: 
[t]he court`s immediate duty is to satisfy itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any order passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court. However, this is not sufficient to require the intervention of the courts on revision. The irregularity or otherwise from the record of proceedings must have resulted in grave and serious injustice powers of revision can only be exercised in exceptional circumstances.
 An example of when such `exceptional circumstances` exist would be where the wrong charge is presented to the court, with the result that the petitioner pleads guilty to and is erroneously convicted of a charge which attracts a heavier punishment: 
PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 573
 . In contrast, where for instance the statement of facts to which the petitioner pleads guilty contains inaccuracies but the petitioner is not prejudiced in any way, there are insufficient grounds for the High Court to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction: 
Packir Malim v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 429
 .
 8.In light of these governing principles of revision, the error in the charge with regards to the place where the petitioner did the alleged negligent act did not suffice as a ground for revision. Admittedly, the place where the alleged offence was committed must be stated in the charge in light of s 159(1) of the CPC, which provides that: 
[t]he charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.
 In the instant case, the petitioner had been at Temasek Boulevard, and not the Pan Island Expressway in front of Victoria School, at 4.43am on 20 January 1998. The act of failing to ensure that sufficient warning signs were carried and displayed behind the lorry by the petitioner`s driver was thus done by the petitioner at Temasek Boulevard when he sent his driver to the Electronic Road Pricing gantry with only a revolving light and no other warning lights or signboards. However, as was held in 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
  and recently reaffirmed in 
Daw Aye Aye Mu v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 64
 , the High Court acting in its appellate capacity has the power to amend charges under s 256(b)(ii) of the CPC, provided this power is not exercised to the prejudice of the accused. Since the High Court also has the powers conferred by s 256 when acting in its revisionary capacity, the location specified in the charge in the present case could be amended from `at Pan Island Expressway in front of Victoria School towards Jurong` to `at Temasek Boulevard`. No prejudice would be caused to the petitioner by such an amendment. Consequently, there was no serious injustice arising from the flaw in the charge.
 9.As for the submission that the statement of facts did not disclose any offence under s 336 of the Penal Code, this could constitute a ground for revision if it is substantiated. In 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
 , the Court of Appeal affirmed that, notwithstanding the lack of a statutory requirement that an accused must admit a statement of facts presented to the court before his plea of guilt can be accepted: 
the recording of a statement of facts by the court following an accused`s plea of guilt, which began as a matter of practice which evolved primarily as a means of assisting judges to determine the appropriate sentence, has evolved into a legal duty on the court to record a statement of facts and to scrutinize the statement of facts for the explicit purpose of ensuring that all the elements of the charge are made out therein.
 As for the contents of the statement of facts, the Court of Appeal approved the requirements laid down by LP Thean J (as he then was) in 
Chota bin Abdul Razak v PP
 
[1991] SLR 675
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 77
 : 
what is required is the admission by the accused of the offence without qualification. It is therefore essential that what the accused admits in the statement of facts contains all the ingredients that constitute the offence with which he is charged. It is not essential, however, that the accused should admit every iota of facts contained in the statement. If what he admits contains all the ingredients that constitute the offence and what he disputes or does not admit is irrelevant or immaterial to the offence, such an admission, in my opinion, is sufficient for the purpose of s 180(b) [of the CPC], and the court should accept his plea of guilty. Such an admission is an admission without qualification of the offence alleged against him.
 The Court of Appeal further indicated that where an accused has pleaded guilty in a subordinate court to the charge, he cannot appeal against his conviction in light of s 44(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322). He may, however, mount an indirect appeal against conviction by an application for revision on the ground that the statement of facts does not satisfy every element of the offence.
 10.In considering a petition for revision based on this ground, the principles governing revision as set out above must be borne in mind. As the Court of Appeal emphasised in 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
 , `the very scope of these powers [of revision] obliges the court to act with great circumspection`. The petitioner must not be allowed to rely on criminal revision as a backdoor means of appeal in cases where no appeal would lie. Thus, a petition for revision on the ground that the statement of facts does not contain all the elements which constitute the offence charged should only be allowed where `it is manifestly plain that the offence charged is nowhere disclosed in the statement of facts tendered` ( 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
 ). It is only in such situations that the insufficiency of the statement of facts may be said to have resulted in `grave and serious injustice` (
 Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v PP 
 (MA No 169 of 1998, Crim Rev No 16 of 1998, unreported)) so as to merit the exercise of the High Court`s revisionary powers. An example of when this test will be satisfied would be the case of 
Chen Hock Heng Textiles Pte Ltd v PP
 [1996] 1 SLR 14 , where the defendant company pleaded guilty to a charge under s 5(3) of the Building Control Act (Cap 29) of continuing to carry out building works without the approval of the Building Authority contrary to s 5(1) of the Act after having earlier been convicted of the same offence (ie the offence under s 5(1)). The statement of facts did not indicate that the defendant company had carried out any building works at all since its earlier conviction, but merely stated that the shed which the company had erected without authorisation had been allowed to remain intact. Since the actus reus of carrying out building works was not contained in the statement of facts, the High Court held that this was a case where it was `manifestly plain that the offence charged is nowhere disclosed in the statement of facts`, and quashed the defendant company`s conviction.
 11.Applying these guidelines to the present case, the issue to be decided was whether the matters set out in the statement of facts disclosed that the petitioner had done an act so negligently as to endanger human life for the purposes of s 336 of the Penal Code. Under s 32 of the Penal Code, an `act` is defined to include an `illegal` omission; that is, an omission `which is an offence, or which is prohibited by law, or which furnishes ground for a civil action` (definition of `illegal` in s 43). The statement of facts alleged that the petitioner failed to ensure that sufficient warning signs were carried and displayed behind the stationary lorry by his driver while the plastic wrapping was being removed from the Electronic Road Pricing gantry. This omission could have founded a civil suit against the petitioner, whether on the basis that the petitioner himself had been negligent or that the petitioner was vicariously liable for his driver`s negligence. The statement of facts did therefore disclose an `act` within the meaning of s 32. As for whether this act was so negligent as to endanger human life, several factors have to be borne in mind. First, it was clear that the lorry would have to be parked on one of the lanes of the expressway while the plastic wrapping was being removed. Second, the work was to be done in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark and while visibility on the road was relatively poor as compared to visibility during the day. Third, vehicles would generally travel at much greater speeds on an expressway as opposed to an ordinary road. In light of all these factors, the petitioner`s failure to ensure that his driver carried and displayed sufficient warning signs behind the stationary lorry while the work was being done could justifiably be said to have been so negligent as to give rise to criminal liability under s 336 of the Penal Code.
 12.Contrary to counsel`s submissions, upholding the petitioner`s conviction on the basis of the facts disclosed in the statement of facts would not result in the petitioner being made vicariously liable for his driver`s negligence. The responsibility of carrying and displaying sufficient warning signs behind the stationary lorry did not fall solely on the petitioner`s driver. The petitioner had a duty to furnish his driver with adequate warning signs and lights before despatching him to remove the plastic wrapping from the Electronic Road Pricing Gantry. This duty was not negated by the mere fact that the petitioner did not personally oversee the removal of the plastic wrapping and was not informed of the exact lane over which the plastic wrapping was dangling. Since the petitioner did not provide his driver with enough warning signs or lights, the latter in turn did not display enough warning signs at the Pan Island Expressway while the work was being done. There was therefore blameworthiness on the petitioner`s part for which he could be made criminally liable under s 336 of the Penal Code. There was no question of the petitioner being made vicariously liable for his driver`s negligence when he himself was not at fault. The principles of vicarious liability, if applicable at all, would be relevant only for the purpose of establishing that the petitioner`s omission had been `illegal`, in the sense of furnishing grounds for a civil action, so as to amount to an `act` under the Penal Code. Thus, the statement of facts did contain all the elements which constitute the offence charged.
 13.For all of the above reasons, the petition for revision was dismissed.
 14.
 The appeal against sentence
Counsel for the petitioner submitted that, if the petitioner`s conviction were to be upheld, the sentence imposed by the district judge should be reduced.
 15.It is trite law that an appellate court should not alter the sentence passed by the court below merely because it might have passed a different sentence: 
Abu Bakar bin Alif v R
 
[1953] MLJ 19
 . As reiterated by the Court of Appeal in 
Tan Koon Swan v PP
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 129
 , an appellate court will not interfere with the sentence meted out by the trial judge unless it is satisfied that the trial judge has made a wrong decision as to the proper factual basis for the sentence, has erred in appreciating the materials placed before him, has passed a sentence which is wrong in principle or has imposed a sentence which is manifestly excessive.
 16.In the present case, the sentence of two months` imprisonment which the district judge imposed was manifestly excessive. The district judge failed to take sufficient account of the fact that the petitioner had been charged under the negligence limb of s 336 of the Penal Code. In 
PP v Gan Lim Soon
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 261
 , I indicated in the context of s 304A of the Penal Code (causing the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide) that a custodial sentence should be imposed where death has been caused by a rash act, whilst a fine would in most cases be sufficient punishment if death is caused by a negligent act. By analogy with the reasoning in that case, a distinction should be drawn between the negligence and rashness limbs of s 336 for sentencing purposes. Greater emphasis should have been placed on the mitigating factors present in this case as well, especially the fact that the petitioner was tired at the material time, had been acting under instructions to have the plastic wrapping removed urgently, and had at least made some attempts to find warning lights for his driver`s use. The district judge also erred in sentencing the petitioner to imprisonment on the basis that even the maximum fine of $250 would not be sufficient to achieve the purpose of deterrence. The maximum quantum of the fine under s 336 was legislated by Parliament. If it is thought that this amount is too low to have any deterrent effect in today`s circumstances, the proper solution would be to have Parliament enact legislation increasing the amount of fine which may be imposed, and not to impose a custodial sentence instead on the accused.
 17.For these reasons, I allowed the petitioner`s appeal against sentence, and ordered that the sentence imposed by the district judge be set aside and substituted with a sentence of 12 days` imprisonment. Taking into account the time which the petitioner had already served in prison from 18 June 1998 to 29 June 1998, this reduced sentence would mean that he would be released immediately.",1998-10-17 00:00:00,SG High Court

JUDITH PRAKASH J
 In today`s increasingly health conscious world, there is a big market for dietary supplements which are believed not only to increase the body`s own health but also to help it combat the deleterious effects of a polluted environment. Pycnogenol, a substance extracted from the bark of the French maritime pine tree, is advertised as a powerful antioxidant which helps neutralise environmental toxins in the body. It was first discovered by one Professor Jack Masquelier but at present there are two companies which manufacture it and claim proprietary rights to it, namely, Horphag Research Ltd, a Guernsey corporation (`Horphag`), and INC BV, a Liechtenstein company (`INC`).
 2.In Singapore, the plaintiffs and the defendants are among the organisations which seek to exploit for commercial benefit the growing interest in health food products. The defendants have their own brand name `Nature`s Farm` and about 20 shops in Singapore through which they sell health food and dietary supplements. The first plaintiff is a sole proprietorship owned by one Daniel Hwee Kum Weng, a pharmacist. The first plaintiff trades in health care products which he purchases from Europe and sells to clients in Asia. One of his clients is the second plaintiff, a company involved in the retail of pharmaceutical and health care products. It is an authorised sub-distributor and wholesaler for various well known brands and supplies products to doctors, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and medical laboratories as well as engaging in direct retail sales through its one retail outlet.
 3.The defendants first started selling pycnogenol in Singapore in 1989. At the time, they sold pycnogenol produced by Horphag. A few years later, however, they ceased selling Horphag pycnogenol and switched to pycnogenol produced by INC. By 1996, apart from the Nature`s Farm brand of pycnogenol, the supplement was also sold in Singapore under the Kordel, Nature`s Sunshine, Irwin`s Natural and New Image brands.
 4.In about May 1996, the plaintiffs entered the market. The first plaintiff imported Horphag pycnogenol tablets from a company in Finland and in June 1996, he signed an agreement with Horphag which made him the sole distributor in Singapore for the Horphag pycnogenol raw material (which the first plaintiff wanted to incorporate into a cream) for the period up to June 1997. At the same time the first plaintiff appointed the second plaintiff as his sole distributor of the Horphag pycnogenol. In pursuance of their commercial objectives, the plaintiffs published and distributed numerous brochures and newspaper advertisements. By July 1996, the plaintiffs had successfully persuaded about 20 retail pharmacies with 70 retail outlets islandwide to stock the Horphag pycnogenol that they dealt in.
 5.On 14 August 1996, the defendants procured the publication of an advertisement in the 
 Straits Times 
. A copy of the full advertisement is attached to this judgment. The advertisement contained a photograph of the defendants` INC pycnogenol and some material about it as well as extracts from a letter written by Professor Masquelier. The material part of the advertisement read as follows: 
... BEWARE PYCNOGENOL The Powerful Antioxidant ...
 
... In Singapore, the only PYCNOGENOL that is manufactured per Professor Jack Masquelier`s technical standards and that is being sold under his explicit trademark authorization is the original PYCNOGENOL that is delivered to you by (the defendants) ...
 
Under authorization of Professor Masquelier, PYCNOGENOL is a trademark of (the defendants`) supplier INC/Vaduz/Liechtenstein. ...
 
PYCNOGENOL is available exclusively at all (the defendants`) stores ...
 
`... Dear Users of PYCNOGENOL
 
... As you know, I am the inventor of the process of extraction of substances coming from the bark of the pine trees and the seed of grapes, and the sole keeper of the name PYCNOGENOL which I created in 1979 and registered as a commercial trademark in France no 1522228 ...
 
I have discovered that the trademark has been fraudulently used and registered in various countries by non-authorised companies. We have taken legal action to end these fraudulent acts ...
 
Yours sincerely,
 
(signature)
 
Professor Jack Masquelier ...`
 It would be noted that the main assertion in the advertisement was the trademark `pycnogenol` belonged to INC under authorisation of Professor Masquelier and that in Singapore the only pycnogenol that was manufactured according to Professor Masquelier`s standards and that was being sold under his explicit trademark authorisation was the original pycnogenol that was sold by the defendants. At this time the trademark `pycnogenol` had not been registered in Singapore.
 6.According to the plaintiffs, although the advertisement did not refer to either of them directly, many people understood that it referred to them and as a result both plaintiffs received many phone calls and correspondence from the public as well as their clients making enquiries as to the truth of the advertisement. The plaintiffs alleged that from the date of the advertisement through to 1997, each of them suffered embarrassment, distress, actual loss of reputable and a general loss of business in relation to the sale of Horphag pycnogenol.
 7.
 Course of the proceedings 
 
In January 1997, the plaintiffs and Horphag commenced this action against the defendants. All three parties sued the defendants for defamation and malicious falsehood based on the advertisement. Horphag, claiming to be the owner of the pycnogenol trademark, also sued the defendants for passing off the INC product as being pycnogenol.
 8.The defendants filed their defence in early February. They admitted placing the advertisement but denied that the words complained of referred or were understood to refer or were capable of referring or of being understood to refer to the plaintiffs or any of them. They further denied that the words were defamatory but, as an alternative, pleaded that the occasion of the publication of the words was an occasion of privilege. A further alternative defence was that the words complained of were true in substance and in fact.
 9.At the time when the advertisement was placed, the defendants were run by a lady named Cynthia Poa. In August 1997, she left the defendants and joined a company owning a chain of health food retail outlets known as GNC. At about this time the defendants ceased to be the distributors for the INC pycnogenol and GNC took over as the new distributor.
 10.In early 1998, there was a dramatic turn of events: the defendants themselves started selling Horphag pycnogenol. They began to publish promotional literature stating in unequivocal terms that pycnogenol was the trademark of Horphag. They did not, however, apologise for the advertisement and they maintained the justification plea in their defence. In June 1998, pursuant to a commercial settlement between the two parties and the defendants` appointment as Horphag`s distributor, Horphag discontinued their claim against the defendants.
 11.On 17 July 1998, the defendants filed a substituted defence in reply to the plaintiffs` substituted statement of claim which had been necessitated by discontinuance of the Horphag suit. It was only then, in the substituted defence, that the defendants abandoned the defence of justification.
 12.At the beginning of the trial, the plaintiffs` stand was that the advertisement was defamatory in its natural and ordinary and/or inferential and/or innuendo meaning and referred to each of them. Pointing to the sections of the advertisement quoted in para 5 above, the plaintiffs asserted that the advertisement in its natural and ordinary and/or inferential and/or innuendo meaning meant and was understood to mean that the first plaintiff and/or the second plaintiff: (a). conducted and were conducting fraudulent businesses;
 (b). misled and/or were misleading the public into purchasing counterfeit pycnogenol products or Horphag pycnogenol products;
 (c). distributed, promoted and/or sold or fraudulently distributed, promoted and sold counterfeit pycnogenol product or Horphag pycnogenol product to the public; and/or used or fraudulently used the pycnogenol trademark without authority.
 13.In their opening statement, the defendants characterised the issues which the court had to decide as follows: (a). whether the advertisement or the words contained therein were defamatory of the plaintiffs or either of them;
 (b). whether the advertisement or the words contained therein referred to or were understood to refer to or were capable of referring or of being understood to refer to the plaintiffs or either of them;
 (c). whether the advertisement or the words contained therein bear or were understood to bear or were capable of bearing or being understood to bear any meanings pleaded by the plaintiffs; and
 (d). whether the defendants` publication of the advertisement was protected by privilege.
 On the third day of the trial, the defendants withdrew the defence of qualified privilege. At the end of the plaintiffs` case, the defendants elected not to call any witnesses although originally they had intended to adduce evidence from Cynthia Poa, her successor one Chan Chong Leong and one Egbert Mensse Schwitters, the principal director of INC. The defendants were left with the technical defences arising from the law of defamation.
 14.
 First issue: was the advertisement defamatory? 
 
The defendants` closing submissions on this point were perfunctory. Mr Rabi`s main contention was that the plaintiffs had not either in their pleadings or in their closing submissions made any reference to specific defamatory words. Although the plaintiffs were claiming to be drawing a defamatory imputation from the phrase `the only pycnogenol that is manufactured per Professor Jack Masquelier`s technical standards` that and the advertisement as a whole were trade puffs and not defamatory.
 15.I could not accept that submission. The emphasis of the advertisement was on fraud and danger and it did not simply extol the benefits of the defendants` product. As Mr Thio submitted, its size and design were meant to draw full attention to its meaning. First of all, the advertisement was represented as a warning to the public against danger. The words `Beware Pycnogenol` were printed in bold with a large font size. Secondly, it contained a photograph of the defendants` INC Pycnogenol to ensure that readers would immediately distinguish it from all other types of pycnogenol. Thirdly, the advertisement was the size of a quarter of a page and printed in the main section of the Straits Times and strategic sections of it were underlined to highlight the defendants` claims which were that they were the only sellers of genuine pycnogenol in Singapore and, therefore by inference, that all other sellers of pycnogenol in the local market were dealing in fake products. All in all, it was an advertisement that could not be overlooked.
 16.Once read, the true meaning of the advertisement was apparent. It showed that the defendants were trying to put the public on Singapore on the alert against being deceived into buying fraudulent products. The defendants` claim was explicit: in Singapore they were the only ones who were selling the original pycnogenol manufactured according to Professor Masquelier`s standards and which bore his trademark authorisation. There was also an allegation, underlined, that Professor Masquelier`s trademark had been fraudulently used by non-authorised companies. The nett effect was that the advertisement meant and was intended to be understood to m ean that other parties in Singapore, including the plaintiffs, who sold pycnogenol were not selling the original product and were fraudulently using the pycnogenol trademark to promote their fake product. The inference and/or innuendo was that such parties were conducting fraudulent businesses, they were misleading the public into purchasing counterfeit pycnogenol products and were distributing, promoting and/or selling such counterfeit products. There was a further innuendo that they were using the pycnogenol trademark without proper authority. All these inferences and innuendoes were clearly defamatory.
 17.
 Second issue: did the advertisement refer to the plaintiffs? 
 
This issue was the main point of the defendants` defence. Mr Rabi noted that the advertisement did not mention either of the plaintiffs by name and in fact it did not mention any particular person other than the defendants themselves. The reference in the advertisement, it was submitted, was to a class of persons distributing and selling pycnogenol products and this class included not just the distributors but also all the retailers. The class was wider than the six or seven people that the plaintiffs had referred to. As an example, counsel referred to one of the plaintiffs` witnesses, Mr Woo, who owned his own pharmacy. He had testified that his own customers had complained that by supplying them with the Horphag pycnogenol he had not been selling them the real pycnogenol and that they could only get that from the defendants. The conclusion was that because the advertisement maligned a whole class without differentiation, the plaintiffs could not complain that they were being pointed out and defamed.
 18.Counsel developed his submission by referring to the law on defamation of a class as set out in the following passage from 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed) at para 7.8 at pp 167 to 169: 
However, the civil law of defamation does not allow an individual to sue in respect of words directed only at a group. Where the words complained of reflect on a body or class of persons generally, such as lawyers, clergymen, publicans, or the like, no particular member of the body or class can maintain an action. `If`, said Willes J in 
 Eastwood v Holmes
, `a man wrote that all lawyers were thieves, no particular lawyer could sue him unless there was something to point to the particular individual`. As this statement makes plain there is no special rule about `class libel`, it is simply a question of whether a reasonable reader could conclude that the plaintiff as an individual was pointed at and the broader the `class` the less likely this is. The leading case is 
 Knupffer v London Express Newspaper
 in which a war time article accused a Russian emigre group, `Mlado Russ`, of being instruments of Hitler. The group numbered 24 members in England and about 2,000 in the world and the plaintiff was head of the British branch. Although four of the plaintiff`s witnesses said that their minds went to him when they read the article, the House of Lords held that as a matter of law the words were incapable of referring to the plaintiff as an individual. According to Lord Atkin, the `reason why a libel published of a large or indeterminate number of persons described by some general name generally fails to be actionable is the difficulty of establishing that the plaintiff was, in fact, included in the defamatory statement, for the habit of making unfounded generalisations is ingrained in ill-educated or vulgar minds, or the words are occasionally intended to be facetious exaggeration`. As a practical matter the plaintiff is more likely to succeed where he is a member of a small group at whom the words are aimed and more likely to fail if the group of a large one; but as a matter of principle the test is not whether the group is `small` or `large`. Thus in 
 Knupffer
`s case Lord Porter said that he `could imagine it being said that each member of a body, however large, was defamed where the libel consisted in the assertion that no one of the members of a community was elected as a member unless he had committed a murder`. Again, the words, though directed at a group, may be used in circumstances which point at a particular individual. For this purpose the knowledge of the recipients of the statement about whom the defendant is aiming at is relevant. In 
 Le Fanu v Malcolmson
 a newspaper article imputed that `in some of the Irish factories` cruelties were practised upon the employees, and the plaintiffs, who were the owners of a factory in Ireland, proved to the satisfaction of the jury that the newspaper was referring especially to their factory. The House of Lords refused to arrest judgment for the plaintiff. In giving judgment Lord Campbell said: `Where a class is described it may very well be that the slander refers to a particular individual. That is a matter of which evidence is to be laid before the jury, and the jurors are to determine whether, when a class is referred to, the individual who complains that the slander applied to him is, in point of fact, justified in making such complaint. That is clearly a reasonable principle, because whether a man is called by one name, or whether he is called by another, or whether he is described by a pretended description of a class to which he is known to belong, if those who look on, know well who is aimed at, the very same injury is inflicted, the very same thing is in fact done as would be done if his name and Christian name were ten times repeated.
 19.Mr Rabi submitted that the question to be answered was whether the words complained of were, on their true construction, published of and concerning the plaintiffs. His contention was that there was nothing in the advertisement which pointed to the plaintiffs in contradistinction to other members of the group of persons marketing and distributing pycnogenol. Mr Rabi pointed out in this connection that a letter written by the first plaintiff showed that both Kordel and New Image considered the advertisement to be referring to them. Further, the witnesses whom the plaintiffs had produced as reference witnesses had given testimony that when they first read the advertisement it had indicated to them that the defendants were the only ones authorised to use the pycnogenol trademark and that they therefore inferred that all others dealing with pycnogenol were dealing with fraudulent pycnogenol. These witnesses had then gone on to say that since they had bought pycnogenol from the second plaintiff, they inferred that the second plaintiff was dealing in a fraudulent product. Counsel`s point was that if the witnesses thought that the advertisement referred to the plaintiffs it was because they knew that the plaintiffs were selling pycnogenol and not because there was something in the advertisement that referred to the plaintiffs.
 20.The claim made in the advertisement was that in Singapore the only pycnogenol manufactured according to Professor Masquelier`s standards and sold under his trademark authorisation was the original pycnogenol delivered by Nature`s Farm. This meant that any other pycnogenol that was being delivered or distributed to the public in Singapore was not original nor manufactured to the necessary standards nor bearing an authorised trademark. The advertisement was aimed at a class of persons and this class was the class that distributed non-Nature`s Farm pycnogenol in Singapore. This was a determinate class. If it was considered to include retailers then it was a rather large class but the members of the class were still capable of identification. In any case, the test of whether words are defamatory or not does not depend on whether the class is large or small. As the passage from 
 Gatley 
 mentions, Lord Porter in 
Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd
 
[1944] AC 116
 was able to imagine that in certain cases each member of a class however large could be defamed by the libel. Lord Atkin in the same case stated that even where there is a libel of a large number of persons `words may be used which enable the plaintiff to prove that the words complained of were intended to be published of each member of the group, or, at any rate, of himself`. See 
Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd
 
[1944] AC 116
 at 122
.
 21.In this case, I considered that as a matter of construction, the advertisement defamed each member of the class concerned in that it was quite clear in implying that anyone (and that included the plaintiffs) who distributed or sold pycnogenol in Singapore other than the defendants themselves was dealing in a fraudulent product and/or using the trademark `pycnogenol` without authorisation. It could not be regarded as an unfounded generalisation made by someone with a vulgar mind because it was a specific accusation made by the person who claimed to be the only authorised dealer in the authentic product, and who thus would be presumed to have knowledge of what was being alleged. The circumstances of this case were far removed from that of 
 Knupffer 
`s where the defamation related to a group called Mlado Russ which had a total membership of 2,000, and where various general allegations were made in respect of the policies and intentions of the group as a whole. They were much closer to the situation in 
Foxcroft v Lacey
 
[1613] Hob 89
; 80 ER 239, also cited in 
 Gatley 
, where a suit was pending against Foxcroft and 16 other persons and in talking about the suit, Lacey said `these defendants helped murder HF`. It was held that although Lacey had referred to a group, each of the defendants was entitled to maintain an action as if he had been specifically called a murderer.
 22.Quite apart from being a member of the class that was defamed, since the advertisement did not specifically name them, the plaintiffs would have to show that it or words therein referred to or were understood as referring to the plaintiffs. The test on reference is set out in 
 Gatley 
 at pp 162 to 163 as follows: 
The test of whether words that do not specifically name the plaintiff refer to him or not is this: Are they such as reasonably in the circumstances would lead persons acquainted with the plaintiff to believe that he was the person referred to? That does not assume that those persons who read the words know all the circumstances or all the relevant facts. But although the plaintiff is not named in words, he may, nevertheless, be described so as to be recognised; and whether that description takes the form of a word picture of an individual or the form of a reference to a class of persons of which he is or is believed to be a member, or any other form, if in the circumstances the description is such that the person hearing or reading the alleged libel would reasonably believe that the plaintiff was referred to, that is a sufficient reference to him.
 In fact, as Mr Thio submitted, even if the plaintiffs in a defamation case do not call or are unable to call witnesses to give evidence of reference, the court can still make a finding of reference. It is sufficient for the plaintiffs to allege and prove that there are persons who know the special facts and so might understand the words complained of in the defamatory sense without proving that any person did in fact understand them in that sense. See 
Hough v London Express Newspaper Ltd
 
[1940] 2 KB 507
. Also as 
 Gatley 
 states in the passage cited at para 18 above, where the words refer to a class, the question is whether a reasonable reader could conclude that each of the plaintiffs, as an individual was pointed at.
 23.The following facts were relevant. First, that there was a smallish group of entities selling or distributing pycnogenol in Singapore and therefore members of the group were easily identifiable. Secondly, in order to promote their product, the plaintiffs had gone on an aggressive advertising and promotion campaign. By the end of July 1996, the second plaintiff had placed advertisements in the 
 Straits Times 
, 
 Berita Harian 
, 
 The New Paper 
 and all the Chinese newspapers. It was reasonable to infer that some people would have seen those advertisements. Thirdly, in the course of their promotional work the plaintiffs had marketed pycnogenol directly to retailers, industry professionals and consumers, and the first plaintiff gave lectures and talks on the efficacy of pycnogenol to professional industry users. The plaintiffs also promoted Horphag pycnogenol to their personal friends and associates by giving away samples, flyers and brochures. Obviously, all these people whom the plaintiffs interacted with personally were aware that the plaintiffs were distributors of pycnogenol. In view of the volume of recent advertising and promotion undertaken by the plaintiffs, it was probable that when the advertisement appeared, their names would have definitely come to the minds of people in the trade as dealers in fake pycnogenol.
 24.Not only did the plaintiffs establish the above facts which would allow the court to infer the existence of individuals who would when reading the advertisement reasonably understand it as referring to the plaintiffs, but they also adduced extrinsic evidence to establish reference. Six persons gave evidence of their reactions when the advertisement appeared. First, there was Ms Chua Chwee Hong, a director of the second plaintiff. She was a good friend of Daniel Hwee and had gone into the pycnogenol business in reliance on his trustworthiness in business. Ms Chua testified that she understood the advertisement to refer to the first plaintiff and said that she was angry with Mr Hwee. She thought that he had sold her fake pycnogenol and she feared the affect on her business reputation and future sales. Ms Chua`s evidence on this point was not challenged in cross-examination. She also testified that after the advertisement appeared she had telephone calls from both identified and unidentified persons querying the authenticity of the pycnogenol sold by the plaintiffs.
 25.Then there was Madam Wong Yiam Moi also known as Mrs Chan, the general manager of NTUC Healthcare. Mrs Chan is a pharmacist and she has known both Mr Hwee and Ms Chua for many years. In August 1996, NTUC Healthcare purchased pycnogenol from the second plaintiff. Mrs Chan had also previously been informed by Mr Hwee that he would be importing pycnogenol for sale in Singapore. Mrs Chan saw the advertisement when she read the 
 Straits Times 
 on the morning of 14 August 1996. She was taken aback because she had bought the pycnogenol in good faith and this advertisement told her that she had been buying from someone who was not authorised to sell it. Mrs Chan immediately sent a copy of the advertisement to the second plaintiff by facsimile transmission and she subsequently telephoned Ms Chua to find out what was going on. Mrs Chan`s evidence was sufficient to establish reference to both plaintiffs.
 26.Mr Cheng Kwong Ghee, a director of a company called Elite Healthcare Pte Ltd, testified that between June 1996 to early August 1996 Elite Healthcare purchased pycnogenol from the second plaintiff whom they had dealt with for some five years. On 14 August he saw the advertisement and to him it stated very clearly that the defendants were the only ones in Singapore who had the exclusive right to sell genuine pycnogenol or use the pycnogenol trademark. Since he knew that the plaintiffs were selling pycnogenol which was not the same as described in the advertisement, he concluded that the advertisement was referring to them. He immediately called Ms Chua to ask her whether the pycnogenol sold to him was genuine. Further evidence was given by one Jeffrey Chua Hwa Choo, one Muhammad Zaki, one Ong Lai Poh, one William Woo and one George Dua that when they saw the advertisement, they concluded that it was referring to the plaintiffs was not seriously challenged by the defendants.
 27.All in all, I was satisfied that the plaintiffs had discharged the burden on them of showing that the words in the advertisement referred to or were understood to refer to or were capable of referring to or of being understood to refer to each of the plaintiffs.
 28.
 Third issue: were the words complained of false? 
 
This issue did not arise in connection with the plaintiffs` claim for defamation since once the defamatory meaning has been established, the law presumes that the words complained of are not true. The plaintiffs, however, had an alternative cause of action for malicious falsehood relating to goods and in order to substantiate that action they had to show that the words complained of were false. This they were able to do.
 29.Evidence was adduced by the first plaintiff of all the steps that he undertook to ensure that the Horphag pycnogenol which he was intending to deal in was authentic. The court was shown copies of various product reports which he had investigated. It was given a scientific dossier on pycnogenol and shown the numerous letters that passed between the first plaintiff and Horphag and between the first plaintiff and the Finnish supplier of the pycnogenol tablets. Also produced was a copy of the US patent certificate AO 4,698,360 for pycnogenol which stated that Jack Masquelier was the inventor of the product and that the patent in it had been assigned to two parties, one of whom was Horphag Overseas Ltd of Guernsey.
 30.The defendants called no evidence to contradict the plaintiffs` assertions that the statements in the advertisement impugning the plaintiffs were false. Although they had originally pleaded justification in answer to the charge of defamation, they subsequently abandoned that defence. In court, no challenge was mounted to the plaintiffs` assertion that Horphag`s pycnogenol was a genuine product and that the difference between it and the INC pycnogenol was source and price. It was telling that at the time of the trial the defendants themselves were selling Horphag`s pycnogenol.
 31.It was also not disputed that at the relevant time there was no pycnogenol trademark registered in Singapore. The plaintiffs` evidence that they were authorised to use Horphag`s pycnogenol trademark was not contradicted.
 32.
 Fourth issue: were the defendants malicious in publishing the advertisement? 
 
The plaintiffs had to establish malice as an ingredient of their second cause of action. The defendants made no effort to meet the plaintiffs` submissions on this point. They did not adduce evidence or put forward any rebuttal to the plaintiffs` points. I was satisfied on the evidence that the allegations of malice had been made out.
 33.At all material times, the defendants had actual or constructive notice that there was no registered owner of the pycnogenol trademark in Singapore. They, therefore, must have known that the plaintiffs were not fraudulently using that trademark in Singapore. As vendors of Horphag pycnogenol from 1989 to 1991, the defendants would have known that Horphag and INC were rivals worldwide in promoting pycnogenol and the issue of the rightful owner of the trademark was unresolved at the time of the advertisement.
 34.The defendants could have disproved malice by adducing evidence of honest belief but they chose not to do so. Neither did they lead any evidence to show that they checked the facts before placing the advertisement. An inference can also be drawn from the defendants` change of position once Cynthia Poa left them and took the INC business with her. At that stage, they started selling the Horphag pycnogenol and made unequivocal statements affirming the authenticity of this product. It would seem that at all material times they knew the advertisement was false but put it forward in order to ensure that they would maintain their market share in pycnogenol notwithstanding the plaintiffs` aggressive advertising of Horphag pycnogenol.
 35.One of the documents disclosed by the defendants in the course of the proceedings showed their motivation quite clearly. It was a letter written to the defendants by INC Agency BV in January 1996. Cynthia Poa wrote some comments on this letter and then re-sent it to Mr Schwitters. The relevant part of her message was `GNC S`pore and another co, viz New Image, coming in very strong with their Pycno. What are our chances of stopping them? And, how quickly, do you think?`. The defendants were obviously concerned with competition in the pycnogenol market and wished to eliminate such competition as quickly as possible.
 36.Malice could also be inferred from the terms of the libel itself. The emphasis of the advertisement was on fraud and danger. Its size and design appeared to be meant to draw full attention to the defamatory meaning. It contained a photograph of the defendants` INC pycnogenol to ensure that readers would be immediately able to distinguish it from all other brands of pycnogenol. The advertisement was placed in the main section of the 
 Straits Times 
. It was presented as a warning to the public since it was headed `BEWARE PYCNOGENOL` with these words printed in uppercase bold print in a large font size. Finally, it contained the false representation that the United States patent referred to belonged only to the defendants` supplier INC when in fact it also belonged to Horphag.
 37.The defendants` conduct after litigation had been commenced was further evidence of malice. The defendants maintained the pleas of justification and qualified privilege though they knew that those defences had no merit. They continued to maintain the justification plea even after they started selling the Horphag pycnogenol and withdrew at an extremely late stage, ie in July 1998 when they filed the substituted defence. Further, the defendants maintained the qualified privilege argument right up to the trial even though in a separate action, Suit 1915 of 1997, which they had started against Cynthia Poa, they had stated that the advertisement was published against their interest and/or was published by Cynthia Poa for a collateral purpose.
 38.Malice can also be inferred if a defendant refuses to apologise even after he is aware that the statement is false. See 
Mathieson v Schneideman
 
[1930] NZLR 151
. Here the defendants refused to apologise or acknowledge that the advertisement was false even after they had: 1. started to sell Horphag pycnogenol; and
 2. unequivocally represented in their product literature that the pycnogenol trademark belonged to Horphag.
 39.
 Fifth issue: quantum of damages 
 
Under s 6(1)(a) of the Defamation Act (Cap 75) it is provided that the plaintiff in an action for slander of goods or other malicious falsehood does not have to allege or prove special damages if, inter alia, the words upon which the action is formed are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff and are published in writing. The words `calculated to` according to 
 Gatley 
 (at p 499) mean simply `likely to produce the result`.
 40.In the present case, the plaintiffs had difficulty in showing special damage as their sales of the product had just started at the time the advertisement appeared. They therefore did not have a track record of sales taking place before the advertisement which could be compared with the sales after the advertisement. Also, although the first plaintiff had alleged that plans of his to expand into other countries in South East Asia had been stymied by the suspicion and mistrust sown by the advertisement, he was not able to substantiate those allegations. The plaintiffs` witnesses did give some evidence of loss of business arising from the advertisement though the plaintiffs were not able to parlay those facts into large figures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it was clear to me that the plaintiffs were still entitled to damages for the malicious falsehood since an advertisement of the nature of the one complained of was likely to cause pecuniary loss to both of them. It was also apparent that the defendants` intention in publishing the advertisement was to take away business from their rivals including the plaintiffs by putting forward the false allegation that the latter were dealing in fake pycnogenol.
 41.For both causes of action, the plaintiffs were entitled to damages to vindicate their reputations and to compensate them for injury to their feelings and business. The nature of the defamation was a very public one and calculated to cause maximum damage. There were aggravating factors which were relevant to the quantification of the damages payable. First, quite apart from the advertisement being placed in the most widely read newspaper in Singapore, the defendants also displayed posters of it at their retail outlets. The plaintiffs` evidence on this was not contradicted nor challenged. Secondly, five of the plaintiffs` witnesses had testified that after the advertisement appeared, they became more cautious about the plaintiffs and/or their products. This showed the very real effect that the defamation had on the reputations of the plaintiffs.
 42.It was relevant to the damages that the defendants pleaded justification and abandoned this plea only at a very late stage. They also continued to maintain their plea of qualified privilege notwithstanding the diametrically opposed position which they had taken in Suit 1915 of 1997 in relation to the publication of the advertisement. This plea was only withdrawn when the documents in that later suit were disclosed at the trial. As a result of the pleas of justification and qualified privilege, the litigation was unnecessarily prolonged.
 43.The malice involved in the defendants` actions was also an aggravating factor. The defendants were aware of the falsity of their statements from the start and yet persisted in refusing to apologise for the defamation. At no time did they show any contrition. They published a false statement in order to obtain commercial benefit and to injure the reputations of their competitors.
 44.Having weighed all the circumstances and having taken into account various authorities cited to me by the plaintiffs, I considered that the appropriate level of damages would be $80,000 for each plaintiff. I therefore gave judgment for each of the plaintiffs in the sum of $80,000 and costs.",1998-11-02 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The accused was convicted on the following charge: 
You, Chen Chih Sheng, are charged that you from, on or about 14 November 1992 to 14 November 1996 were a director at Victoria City Restaurant Pte Ltd of 2, Havelock Road, Apollo Centre [num ]02-01 which had from, on or about early October 1996 to 30 October 1996 committed an offence of employing a foreign worker, namely, one Chin Sai Piew, without having obtained a valid work permit allowing him to work for the said company under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A), the commission of which offence was attributable to your default, and you have thereby, by virtue of s 16D, committed an offence under s 5(1) punishable under s 5(4) of the same Act.
 2.The prosecution submitted that, as the accused had a previous conviction under s 5(6) read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A, 1991 Ed) (`the 1991 Act`), his current conviction under s 16D read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A, 1991 Ed), as amended by the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Act (Act 37 of 1995), (`the 1995 Act`) was a second conviction under the 1995 Act and accordingly should be punished with mandatory imprisonment as required by s 5(4)(b)(i) of the 1995 Act. The trial judge found however that the accused`s conviction under the 1991 Act should not be considered a previous conviction under the 1995 Act and his current conviction should therefore not be considered a second conviction under the 1995 Act which would attract the punishment of mandatory imprisonment. In the result, the trial judge sentenced the accused to pay a fine of 48 months` levy, amounting to $15,840.
 3.The Public Prosecutor appealed against the sentence imposed by the trial judge. The accused responded by appealing against his conviction, but not his sentence.
 4.
 Facts 
 
A Malaysian, one Chin Sai Piew (`Chin`) approached one Chan Tonny Chun Fatt (`Ah Fatt`), for work at Victoria City Restaurant (`the restaurant`) some time in October 1996. Ah Fatt interviewed him and employed him at the restaurant. Chin started working at the restaurant and only applied for a work permit on 1 November 1996. At the same time, he applied for a temporary work permit which was granted. By a letter dated 4 November 1996, the Ministry of Labour notified the restaurant that Chin`s application for a work permit had been rejected and that his temporary work permit would be cancelled with effect from 9 November 1996.
 5.On 14 November 1996, Yeo Sze Kwang, an employment inspector from the Ministry of Labour, together with several other inspectors, conducted an inspection at the restaurant. Chin and two other Malaysian workers were arrested for working without valid work permits.
 6.The Ministry of Labour prosecuted the restaurant under s 5(1) of the 1995 Act for employing Chin and the other two Malaysian workers without valid work permits. The restaurant pleaded guilty to all three charges and was fined a total of $33,660.
 7.
 P4 
 
The accused was subsequently interviewed by the investigating officer, PW1. The following statement, P4, was recorded: 
(1) I am a Singaporean citizen and I am the managing director of Victoria City Restaurant Pte Ltd. I have been managing director of the restaurant since 14 November [1990]. 
(2) I am here at the Ministry today to give a statement regarding three Malaysians who were found working at the restaurant by a group of employment inspectors during a surprise check conducted on 14 November 1996 at about 11.10am. 
(3) I am married with two children and my highest educational level is Form 2. I am able to speak and understand Mandarin. Hence I am giving my statement voluntarily in Mandarin. 
(4) I am the person in charge of the restaurant. My duties are to oversee the business of the restaurant and also to handling issues on the marketing aspects. 
(5) There are about 30 workers working at the restaurant. There are a manager, a supervisor supervising waitresses and waiters, and two supervisors supervising workers in the kitchen. 
(6) The two supervisors supervising workers working in the kitchen are Ah Fatt and Ah Min. As I am always not around at the restaurant, I have authorised my supervisors to recruit workers to work at the inspected restaurant. For example, if Ah Fatt finds there is a shortage of workers in the kitchen, he would recruit workers himself. He does not have to inform me regarding the recruitment. Hence, it would be the same for other supervisors. They are also given the authority to recruit workers to work in their areas of supervision. They will make the final decision. 
(7) As for payment of salary to the workers recruited by the supervisors, they will have to inform the accountant that a certain amount of money has to be paid to these workers. 
(8) However, when the supervisors apply work permits or employment passes for these workers, they will have to submit forms for me to sign. 
(9) The restaurant operates daily from 11am to 11pm. I would be there about two to three times per week to oversee the business. At times, I would stay there for the whole day or only for one to two hours. 
(10) During the time of the inspection, I was not present at the restaurant. 
(11) When I am not around at the restaurant, the supervisors and manager will oversee the operations of the restaurant. 
(12) I am now shown the polaroid photographs of the following persons: 
(a) Chin Sai Piew; 
(b) Ang Dek Pau; and 
(c) Lim Tow Hong. 
I do not recognise the above subjects as I have never seen them before. I am not sure whether the subjects are employed by Ah Fatt as he is the person who is in charge of workers working at the restaurant. So far, Ah Fatt did not mention anything about the subjects. 
(13) However, I remember not long ago, Ah Fatt gave me two application forms to sign. He said that he had employed a few workers and they need to have work permits. Hence I signed the forms. But I do not know who are the workers that he has applied work permits for. 
(14) For every worker employed by Ah Fatt, he would distribute salaries to them. I believe these workers do not have to sign for any payment vouchers. 
(15) I wish to say that it is due to my negligence that I had allowed my workers to employ on my behalf. I should exercise more stringent control over the recruitment of these workers. 
(16) That is all. 
(17) The above statement has been read and explained to me in Mandarin, a language which I understand. I confirm it to be correct and true.
 The above will henceforth be referred to as paras 1 to 17 of P4.
 8.PW1 testified that the accused had chosen to make his statement in Mandarin. PW1 recorded his statement in English through an interpreter, one Hang Teck Yi (`Hang`), who conversed with the accused in Mandarin. The statement was read over and explained to the accused in Mandarin. The accused confirmed that the statement was correct and declined to make any amendments. The accused signed both pages of the statement. Under cross-examination, PW1 testified that the accused had not said that his Mandarin was not very good. PW1 questioned the accused in English, and the questions were interpreted through Hang to the accused in Mandarin. The accused replied in Mandarin and his answers were interpreted through Hang to PW1 in English. Hang was present throughout the recording of the statement.
 9.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
The mainstay of the prosecution`s case was the admissions made by the accused in P4. The accused had admitted that (a) he was in charge of the restaurant, (b) as he was only around two or three times a week, he had delegated the task of recruiting workers to his supervisors, (c) he had been negligent in allowing his supervisors to recruit on his behalf, and (d) he should have exercised more stringent control over the employment of the workers. The employment of Chin was therefore attributable to the accused`s default.
 10.The trial judge found that a prima facie case had been made out against the accused and called for his defence.
 11.
 The defence 
 
The accused gave evidence in his own defence. He testified that, right from the very start, Ah Fatt had been allowed to take full charge of the running of the kitchen. Ah Fatt was called the supervisor of the kitchen, and one Wong Min, who worked directly under Ah Fatt, was the second supervisor. All those who worked in the kitchen were answerable to Ah Fatt. The accused was not responsible for the recruitment of employees in the kitchen. The kitchen staff was employed by Ah Fatt. Ah Fatt was also responsible for the supervision of the kitchen staff, applying for work permits and paying their salaries. The accused admitted however that he signed the applications for the work permits. However, apart from this, he did not have any role in the employment of the staff.
 12.The accused testified that he had met Chin on either 2 or 3 November 1996, two or three days after he had signed the application form for Chin`s work permit. Ah Fatt told him that Chin had obtained a work permit.
 13.The accused claimed that he knew that the law pertaining to employing illegal workers in Singapore was very strict and so he took precautions against contravening the law. The accused gathered the staff for a discussion everyday and always cautioned them not to engage illegal workers. When the restaurant advertised for staff in the newspapers, it was always emphasised that only Singaporeans or Permanent Residents would be considered. Notices were put up at the restaurant stating that unauthorised workers were not allowed on the premises. The supervisors were given handbooks which clearly stated that no illegal workers were allowed.
 14.The accused then gave evidence as to the recording of P4. PW1 told him that she would be recording a statement from him and that she would speak to him in either English or Mandarin. He told PW1 that he might not be able to understand her. She then started questioning him and recording his statement. At this time, the interpreter, Hang, was not in the room. He told PW1 to speak slowly as he was not able to understand her. PW1 said that she would get an interpreter to read back his statement back to him. Hang then came in and asked him whether he understood the statement PW1 had recorded. The accused asked him what he meant by `understood`. Hang read back the statement to him. PW1 then recorded a statement from him afresh, this time through Hang. He was not able to fully understand the Mandarin spoken by Hang. Hang even used English words intermittently. Whenever he asked for an explanation of English words used, Hang was unable to give a satisfactory explanation. When asked by the court whether he had made the statements contained in paras 3, 6 and 15 of P4, the accused denied making those statements.
 15.Under cross-examination, the accused was asked why he had to sign the application forms for work permits when all other matters relating to recruitment were handled by Ah Fatt. He replied that he had to sign because the forms required the signature of a representative of the company. He later conceded however that Ah Fatt too was able to sign the forms as a representative of the company. The accused then said that the board of directors had decided from the outset that he should sign these forms. He was then asked whether he conducted regular spot checks to ensure that there were no illegal workers employed by the restaurant. He replied that he had ordered notices to be put up stating that no illegal workers were allowed on the premises and that the handbooks given to the supervisors stated that daily inspections were to be carried out. The accused first said that the supervisors did carry out daily inspections, but later admitted that he did not actually know if they had carried out daily inspections, and that he had reposed a great deal of trust in his supervisors to ensure that the precautionary measures adopted by him against the employment of illegal workers were carried out. He also admitted that no one was deployed at the staff entrance of the restaurant to ensure that all the workers going in had work permits.
 16.The cross-examination then turned to the recording of P4. The accused said that he had not understood what PW1 had said at all, which was why she had sent for an interpreter. He said first that he was not sure how long he had spoken to PW1 before she sent for an interpreter, but later said that they had been conversing for about 15 minutes before the interpreter, Hang, came in. The accused was then asked whether PW1 had asked him whether he was married and how many children he had. The accused replied that PW1 had asked him these questions. The accused was then asked how he could have known that PW1 had asked him these questions when he had earlier testified that he had been unable to understand PW1 at all. The accused replied that he had only understood the question because PW1 had used the word `babies`. He also said that Hang had spoken to him in Mandarin and he had not understood what he was saying. The whole of P4 was then read out and translated to him and he was asked which parts of P4 were correct and which parts were wrong. He said that (a) para 2 was correct, (b) the last three lines in para 3 were incorrect; as he only understood a little Mandarin, (c) para 4 was correct, (d) para 6 was correct, (e) the second sentence in para 6 was not correct; Ah Fatt was in charge of all matters in the kitchen, (f) para 7 was correct, (g) para 8 was correct, (h) para 9 was incorrect; the restaurant opened from 11am to 3pm and then again from 6pm to 11pm; the second sentence of para 9 should be `I would be having meetings or discussions with friends or business associates two to three times a week`, (i) para 11 was correct, (j) para 12 was correct, (k) para 13 was correct, (l) the second sentence in para 14 was incorrect; Ah Fatt signed the workers` payment vouchers, and (m) the first sentence in para 15 was incorrect; the accused had not authorised Ah Fatt to recruit workers. The accused was then asked if para 17 was correct. The accused said that the statement had been read back to him in Mandarin, but he had been unable to understand what Hang was saying. The accused had signed the statement because Hang told him that the statement was for record purposes and that the accused was merely giving a statement on behalf of the restaurant.
 17.
 The evidence of Ah Fatt 
 
Before I turn to the evidence of Ah Fatt, it is essential that I set out the series of events leading up to the calling of Ah Fatt as a witness. Under s 22 of the 1995 Act, if the accused could prove that he had acted with due diligence and that Ah Fatt had committed the offence with which the accused was charged, without the consent, connivance or wilful default of the accused, the accused would not be guilty of the offence and Ah Fatt would be convicted of the offence instead. On 19 November 1997, the following summons (PSS 827/97) was issued against Ah Fatt as the accused intended to try to exempt himself from liability under s 22 of the Act: 
You, Chan Tonny Chun Fatt are charged that you, being the chief supervisor at Victoria City Restaurant Pte Ltd of 2, Havelock Road, Apollo Centre, [num ]02-01 Singapore 059763, which had from, on or about 9 November 1996 to 14 November 1996 committed the offence of employing a foreign worker, namely, one Chin Sai Piew, without having obtained a valid work permit allowing him to work for the said company under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A), and which offence was attributable to your act and you have thereby by virtue of s 16D of the Act, committed an offence under s 5(1) read with s 22(1) of the said Act, punishable under s 5(4) of the same Act.
 18.The Ministry of Labour responded to this by issuing a summons containing the following charge (LAB 2535/97): 
You, Chan Tonny Chun Fatt, are charged that you, from on or about early October to 30 October 1996 at Victoria City Restaurant Pte Ltd of 2, Havelock Road, Apollo Centre, [num ]02-01 Singapore 059763, did abet Victoria City Restaurant in the commission of the offence of employing a foreign worker, namely, one Chin Sai Piew, in that you intentionally aided the said Victoria City Restaurant to employ the said Chin Sai Piew contrary to s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A), when the said Victoria City Restaurant had not obtained in respect of the said foreign worker a valid work permit allowing the foreign worker to work for the said company, which offence was committed in consequence of the abetment and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 5(4) read with s 19(1) of the Act.
 19.Before the commencement of the accused`s trial, Ah Fatt pleaded guilty to and was convicted on LAB 2535/97. In the middle of the accused`s trial, counsel for the accused announced the accused`s intention to exempt himself from liability under s 22 of the 1995 Act. This required the accused to prove that Ah Fatt was guilty of the charge contained in PSS 827/97. However, as Ah Fatt had already been convicted on LAB 2535/97, by virtue of s 239 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`), and art 11(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1992 Ed) (`the Constitution`), the doctrine of autrefois convict applied and Ah Fatt could not be tried and convicted on the charge contained in PSS 827/97. The trial judge therefore doubted that the accused could exempt himself from liability under s 22. Nonetheless, as the trial judge felt that Ah Fatt`s evidence was essential to the just decision of the case, he exercised his power under s 399 of the CPC and called Ah Fatt as a witness. The trial judge also allowed both the prosecution and the defence to cross-examine him.
 20.Under cross-examination by the defence, Ah Fatt testified that the accused was not involved in the recruitment of kitchen staff. It was Ah Fatt`s responsibility to ensure that no illegal workers were employed in the kitchen. Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Ah Fatt said that the accused was totally uninvolved in the employment of kitchen workers. However, he later admitted that the accused signed the application forms for work permits for the kitchen workers. When asked whether the accused conducted spot checks to see if there were any illegal workers employed in the kitchen, Ah Fatt replied that the accused occasionally did so. When asked whether he complied with the requirement in the supervisors` handbook that daily inspections be carried out, Ah Fatt replied that he did. Finally, Ah Fatt said that he had been authorised by the accused to employ kitchen workers.
 21.
 Decision below 
 
The trial judge found that the accused had understood the questions posed to him by PW1 through the interpreter, Hang, while his statement, P4, was being recorded, and that he understood the contents of the statement when Hang read the statement back to him. The accused was obviously trying to undermine the reliability of P4, which contained numerous admissions which were adverse to his defence, by claiming that he had not understood what PW1 and Hang were saying. The trial judge accordingly found that everything in P4 was correct, including the parts which the accused claimed were incorrect, and that the contents of P4 should be preferred over any statements to the contrary in the accused`s testimony.
 22.The trial judge then went on to consider whether the employment of Chin by the restaurant without a valid work permit was attributable to the accused`s default. The trial judge found that the primary responsibility for recruiting kitchen staff rested with the accused. He had however delegated this responsibility to Ah Fatt, and actually admitted that he was negligent in so doing. The trial judge accepted that the accused had put up notices stating that no illegal workers were allowed on the premises, that he had repeatedly reminded his supervisors not to employ illegal workers, and that the supervisors` handbook specifically stated that no illegal workers were to be employed. However, the trial judge found that the accused had not taken any practical steps to enforce these precautionary measures against the employing of foreign workers. The trial judge rejected Ah Fatt`s evidence that the accused conducted occasional spot checks in person, noting that that the accused himself had evaded the question as to spot checks during cross-examination. He found that the accused had not carried out spot checks, nor had he stationed personnel outside the staff entrance to ensure that only workers with a valid work permit entered the restaurant premises. In the result, the trial judge found that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the employment of Chin by the restaurant without a valid work permit was attributable to the accused`s default.
 23.The trial judge then went on to consider if the accused was able to exempt himself from liability under s 22 of the Act. He noted that, in order for the accused to rely on s 22, the accused had to show that he had exercised due diligence to enforce the provisions of the Act. The trial judge was of the view that the standard of diligence required was very high. In the instant case, the measures or steps taken by the accused fell short of personally checking the identity of the kitchen workers to ensure that there were no illegal workers employed in the kitchen, and the accused had therefore failed to show that he had exercised due diligence to enforce the provisions of the Act.
 24.Finally, the trial judge dealt with the sentence which should be imposed. The prosecution submitted that as the accused had a previous conviction under s 5(6) read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1991 Act, his current conviction under s 16D read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1995 Act was a second conviction under the 1995 Act and accordingly should be punished with mandatory imprisonment as required by s 5(4)(b)(i) of the 1995 Act. The trial judge found however that the accused`s conviction under the 1991 Act should not be considered a previous conviction under the 1995 Act and his current conviction should therefore not be considered a second conviction under the 1995 Act which would attract the punishment of mandatory imprisonment. In the result, the trial judge sentenced the accused to pay a fine of $15,840.
 25.
 The appeals 
 
Counsel for the defence contended that the trial judge had erred in: (a). relying on P4;
 (b). finding that the employment of Chin by the restaurant without a valid work permit was attributable to the default of the accused; and
 (c). finding that the accused was not entitled to exempt himself from liability under s 22 of the 1995 Act.
 26.The DPP on the other hand contended that the trial judge had erred in finding that the accused`s conviction under the 1991 Act should not be considered a previous conviction under the 1995 Act and his current conviction should therefore not be considered a second conviction under the 1995 Act which would attract the punishment of mandatory imprisonment.
 27.
 Whether the trial judge had erred in relying on P4 
 
Counsel for the accused contended that the trial judge should not have relied on P4 in light of the circumstances in which it had been recorded. The accused had hardly understood what PW1 and the interpreter, Hang were saying, both when the accused was being questioned and when the statement was read back to him. The contents of the statement were therefore likely to be inaccurate and therefore unreliable. I found this contention to be without merit. Firstly, I found that the accused`s evidence contained marked inconsistencies as to the level of understanding he had of what PW1 and Hang were saying. For example, the accused claimed that his understanding of what PW1 and Hang were saying was so limited that, when PW1 asked him whether he was married and if so, if he had any children, he had been unable to understand the question until PW1 mentioned the word `babies`. Yet when asked under cross-examination why he had signed the statement when, as he claimed, he had not understood what Hang had read back to him, the accused immediately said that he had done so because Hang had told him that the statement was for record purposes only and the accused was required to sign it as the representative of the restaurant. It seemed to me incredible that the accused, whose understanding of Mandarin was supposedly so limited that he could not understand a simple question about his family, could understand and recount in court what Hang had told him.
 28.Secondly, when the accused was asked to point out which parts of P4 were correct and which parts were incorrect, the accused was forced to admit that most of P4 was correct. As to those parts which were incorrect, some of them were minor errors relating to dates and the restaurant`s opening hours, while the remaining parts were, coincidentally, those parts of the statement which contained admissions adverse to the accused`s interest. It seemed to me far too much of a coincidence to be believable that, despite the accused`s inability to understand PW1 and Hang, most of what was recorded in P4 was correct and the only parts which were recorded incorrectly were those which were adverse to the accused`s defence.
 29.Thirdly, PW1 testified that, during the recording of P4, the accused had chosen to speak in Mandarin. The accused had not said that he was not conversant in Mandarin. The interpreter, Hang, had been present throughout the recording of P4. This evidence was unchallenged during cross-examination. PW1 made no mention of any difficulties the accused had in understanding either PW1 or Hang, nor was she cross-examined on this point.
 30.In my opinion, the trial judge was fully justified in finding that the accused was trying to undermine the reliability of P4, which contained numerous admissions which were adverse to his defence, by claiming that he had not understood what PW1 and Hang were saying, when he had in fact understood their questions. I also agreed with the trial judge that everything in P4 was correct, including the parts which the accused claimed were incorrect, and that the contents of P4 should be preferred over any statements to the contrary in the accused`s testimony.
 31.
 Whether the employment of Chin by the restaurant without a valid work permit was attributable to the default of the accused 
 
I turned first of all to consider whether a prima facie case had been made out against the accused at the end of the prosecution`s case. The trial judge`s analysis of the prosecution`s case was as follows: the accused had admitted in P4 that (a) he was in charge of the restaurant, (b) as he was only around two or three times a week, he had delegated the task of recruiting workers to his supervisors, (c) he had been negligent in allowing his supervisors to recruit on his behalf, and (d) he should have exercised more stringent control over the employment of the workers. A prima facie case had therefore been made out that the employment of Chin was attributable to the accused`s default. I was unable to agree with the trial judge`s analysis. The accused was the managing director of the restaurant. It was not unreasonable for him to delegate the task of recruiting workers to his supervisors. The mere fact that he had done so did not make the employment of Chin by the restaurant without a valid work permit attributable to the default of the accused. In my opinion, therefore, a prima facie case was not made out on the facts relied upon by the trial judge.
 32.I was nonetheless of the view that a prima facie case had been made out at the end of the prosecution`s case. The agreed statement of facts showed that Chin had applied for a work permit on 1 November 1996. The application for a work permit included an application for a temporary work permit. In P4, the accused admitted that all applications for work permits were submitted to him to sign. He had therefore signed Chin`s application form and should have known that Chin was applying for a permanent as well as a temporary work permit. He should have monitored the status of Chin`s application. Had he done so, he would have known that Chin had been granted a temporary work permit and was working in the restaurant. He would also have known that, by a letter dated 4 November 1996, Chin`s application for a permanent work permit had been rejected and his temporary work permit would be cancelled as from 9 November 1996. Under s 9(1) of the 1995 Act, when an employer is notified of the Controller of Work Permit`s decision to cancel a foreign worker`s work permit, the employer is given a period of seven days from the date of receiving the notification to terminate the service of the foreign worker. The accused should therefore have checked to make sure that Chin stopped working at the restaurant from 11 November 1996. The accused, however, failed to do so. As such, the employment of Chin from 11 November 1996 to 14 November 1996, the date Chin was caught by the employment inspectors, by the restaurant without a valid work permit, was attributable to the accused`s default.
 33.I then turned to consider whether there was anything in the defence to displace the prima facie case against the accused. A close scrutiny of the defence only served to strengthen the case against the accused. The accused admitted that even though he had delegated every other aspect of the recruitment of workers to Ah Fatt, he had retained the authority to sign the application forms for work permits. The accused also admitted that he had signed Chin`s application form for a work permit. The accused had met Chin two or three days after he signed Chin`s application form for a work permit. Ah Fatt had told him that Chin had obtained a work permit. The accused must therefore have known that Chin had obtained a temporary work permit and was working in the restaurant. This made it all the more imperative that the accused monitor the status of Chin`s application, so as to make sure that Chin stopped working at the restaurant if his application for a permanent work permit was rejected and his temporary work permit was cancelled.
 34.Counsel for the accused laid great emphasis on the fact that the accused was the managing director of the restaurant and that a man of his position could not be expected to direct his mind to such mundane matters as the monitoring of a foreign worker`s application for a work permit. The short answer to this was that the relevant touchstone in these cases is not the position which the accused occupies or the title that he holds, but the degree and nature of his participation in the employment process. In the instant case, the accused was responsible for the signing of the foreign workers` application forms for work permits. It was accordingly incumbent upon him to assume the attendant responsibilities of monitoring the status of these applications and ensuring that any foreign worker whose application was rejected or whose work permit was cancelled ceased to work at the restaurant. The standard of care and diligence required in the discharge of these responsibilities was a high one and one which the accused had manifestly failed to meet.
 35.In the result, therefore, I was of the view that the accused`s failure to monitor the status of Chin`s application for a work permit and his consequent failure to check to make sure that Chin stopped working at the restaurant from 11 November 1996 meant that the employment of Chin from 11 November 1996 to 14 November 1996 by the restaurant without a valid work permit, was attributable to the accused`s default. I accordingly directed that the charge be amended to read as follows, pursuant to an appellate court`s power to amend the charge under s 256 of the CPC: 
You, Chen Chih Sheng, are charged that you from, on or about 14 November 1992 to 14 November 1996 were a director at Victoria City Restaurant Pte Ltd of 2, Havelock Road, Apollo Centre [num ]02-01 which had from, on or about 11 November 1996 to 14 November 1996 committed an offence of employing a foreign worker, namely, one Chin Sai Piew, without having obtained a valid work permit allowing him to work for the said company under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A), the commission of which offence was attributable to your default, and you have thereby, by virtue of s 16D, committed an offence under s 5(1) punishable under s 5(4) of the same Act.
 I noted that no prejudice would be occasioned to the accused by the amendment as neither the evidence nor the result would have been different had the accused been tried on the amended charge. The only defence the accused could have raised was that he had monitored Chin`s application and checked to make sure that Chin stopped working for the restaurant once his temporary work permit had expired. The accused clearly failed to do this, otherwise Chin would not have been caught working at the restaurant on 14 November 1996 by the employment inspectors.
 36.
 Whether the accused could exempt himself from liability under s 22 of the 1995 Act 
 
It is convenient at this point to set out s 22 of the 1995 Act: 
(1) Where a person is charged with an offence under this Act, he shall be entitled, upon a charge duly made by him and on giving to the prosecution not less than 3 days` notice in writing of his intention, to have any other person whom he charges as the actual offender (whether or not that person is his agent or employee) brought before the court at the time appointed for hearing the charge; and if, after the commission of the offence has been proved, the first-mentioned person proves to the satisfaction of the court - 
(a) that he has used all due diligence to enforce the execution of this Act and any relevant regulations or orders made thereunder; and 
(b) that the second-mentioned person had committed the offence in question without his consent, connivance or wilful default,
 
the first-mentioned person shall not be guilty of the offence and the second-mentioned person shall be convicted of the offence and shall, in the discretion of the court, be also liable to pay any costs incidental to the proceedings.
 
(2) The prosecution shall have the right in any such case to cross-examine the first-mentioned person if he gives evidence and any witnesses called by him in support of his charge, and to call rebutting evidence. 
(3) Where the second-mentioned person brought before the court under subsection (1) by the first-mentioned person is found by the court to have committed the offence with the consent, connivance or wilful default of the first-mentioned person, the court may, after convicting the second-mentioned person, convict the first-mentioned person on a substituted charge of abetment of the offence. 
(4) When it is made to appear to the satisfaction of an employment inspector at the time of discovering an offence - 
(a) that the person who would be proceeded against apart from this subsection has used all due diligence to enforce the execution of this Act and any relevant regulations or orders made thereunder; 
(b) by which person the offence has been committed; and 
(c) that it has been committed without the consent, connivance or wilful default of the first-mentioned person and in contravention of his orders,
 
the employment inspector shall proceed against the person whom he believes to be the actual offender without first proceeding against the first-mentioned person.
 37.Under s 22 of the 1995 Act, therefore, the accused was entitled to prefer a charge against Ah Fatt, and if the accused could prove that he had acted with due diligence and that Ah Fatt had committed the offence in question, without the consent, connivance or wilful default of the accused, the accused would not be guilty of the offence and Ah Fatt would be convicted of the offence instead. The accused accordingly preferred the charge contained in PSS 827/97 against Ah Fatt. However, before the commencement of the accused`s trial, Ah Fatt had pleaded guilty to and been convicted on LAB 2535/97. As such, by virtue of s 239 of the CPC, and art 11(2) of the Constitution, the doctrine of autrefois convict applied and Ah Fatt could not be tried or convicted on the charge contained in PSS 827/97. The trial judge was therefore of the view that the accused could not exempt himself from liability under s 22. Despite his reservations, the trial judge went on to consider if the accused could exempt himself from liability under s 22, and he concluded that the accused was unable to do so as he was unable to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he had exercised all due diligence to enforce the execution of the Act.
 38.Counsel for the accused contended that the fact that Ah Fatt had been convicted on LAB 2535/97 and could not be convicted on the charge contained in PSS 827/97 did not by itself prevent the accused from exempting himself from liability under s 22 of the 1995 Act. After examining the purpose and the wording of s 22 of the 1995 Act, I agreed with counsel for the accused. The purpose of s 22 is to give an accused a chance to exempt himself from liability by showing that a second person committed the offence with which the accused is charged. There is no reason why an accused should be precluded from invoking s 22 simply because the second person cannot be convicted of that offence.
 39.I noted that s 22(1) clearly states in terms that, where the accused has proved to the satisfaction of the court that a second person has committed the offence in question, the court shall convict that second person of that offence. I was of the view, however, that this mandatory direction must be read subject to the doctrine of autrefois convict embodied in s 239 of the CPC and Article 11(2) of the Constitution. Section 22(1) should therefore be construed as requiring the court to convict the second person of the offence in question, if it is proven to the satisfaction of the court that he committed the offence, unless the doctrine of autrefois convict applies to protect the second person from conviction.
 40.What then is the procedure to be adopted when an accused tries to exempt himself from liability under s 22 and the second person cannot be convicted of the offence with which the accused is charged because of the doctrine of autrefois convict? In such a situation, the second person does not stand in the position of an accused, as he cannot be tried and convicted of the offence in question. The question of his guilt is only relevant insofar as to determine whether the accused is able to exempt himself from liability under s 22. The second person should not therefore enjoy the privileges of an accused person, and he should not be tried for the offence in the strict sense of the word. The second person may thus be called as a witness by the accused. He may be cross-examined by the prosecution: see s 22(2) of the 1995 Act. The second person may also be called by the prosecution, and be subject to cross-examination by the defence. In the event that neither the prosecution nor the defence calls the second person as a witness, the court may exercise its power under s 399 of the CPC, as the court below did in the instant case, and call the second person as a witness if the court is of the view that his evidence is essential to the just decision of the case. The court may then allow both the prosecution and the defence to cross-examine him. If the accused proves to the satisfaction of the court that he has exercised due diligence and that the second person committed the offence without the accused`s consent, connivance or wilful default, the accused will be acquitted of the offence with which he is charged. As for the second person, he will not be convicted of the offence in question because of the application of the doctrine of autrefois convict.
 41.I must emphasise, however, that the above situation should be avoided. Firstly, it smacks of duplicity of proceedings. Secondly, there is a danger that the second person, secure in the knowledge that he cannot be convicted on the charge preferred against him, may be readily persuaded to shoulder the blame for the benefit of the accused. An accused who intends to try and exempt himself from liability under s 22 should therefore prefer a charge against the second person and inform the prosecution of this as soon as possible. The prosecution should then refrain from preferring a charge against the second person arising out of the same facts until the accused has been tried. If such a charge has already been preferred, the prosecution should proceed to have the second person tried on that charge only after the accused has been tried. If the accused proves to the satisfaction of the court during the course of his trial that the second person committed the offence with which the accused is charged, the second person can then be convicted of that offence and the prosecution must discontinue any proceedings pending against him.
 42.I next turned to consider whether, on the facts of the instant case, the accused could exempt himself from liability under s 22 of the 1995 Act. In order to exempt himself from liability, the accused had to show that (a) he had exercised all due diligence to enforce the execution of the Act and (b) Ah Fatt had committed the offence in question without his consent, connivance or wilful default. After reviewing the evidence, I was of the view that the accused had failed to satisfy limb (a). My reasons for this were broadly similar to those set out in [para ] 32 to 35. In the circumstances, the accused should have monitored the status of Chin`s application for a work permit and checked to make sure that Chin stopped working in the restaurant once his application for a permanent work permit had been rejected and his temporary work permit had expired. The accused`s failure to do so meant that he had failed to exercise all due diligence to enforce the execution of the Act and accordingly his attempt to exempt himself from liability under s 22 of the Act failed at the first hurdle.
 43.In the result therefore the accused`s appeal against his conviction failed.
 44.
 Whether the accused`s conviction under the 1991 Act should be considered a previous conviction under the 1995 Act 
 
The accused had a previous conviction under s 5(6) read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1991 Act. His current conviction was under s 16D read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1995 Act. The trial judge found that the accused`s conviction under the 1991 Act should not be considered a previous conviction under the 1995 Act and his current conviction should therefore not be considered a second conviction under the 1995 Act which would attract the punishment of mandatory imprisonment under s 5(4)(b)(i) of the 1995 Act. The DPP contended that the trial judge had erred in so finding.
 45.It is convenient at this point to set out the relevant statutory provisions. Section 5(6) of the 1991 Act reads: 
Where any offence under subsection (1) is committed by a body corporate, and it is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
 Section 5(1) of the 1991 Act reads: 
No person shall employ a foreign worker unless he has obtained in respect of the foreign worker a valid work permit which allows the foreign worker to work for him.
 Section 5(4) of the 1991 Act reads: 
Any person who fails to comply with or contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall -
 
(a) be liable on conviction to a fine of an amount of not less than 24 months` levy and not more than 48 months` levy or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both; and 
(b) on a second or subsequent conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than one month and not more than one year and shall also be liable to a fine of an amount of not less than 24 months` levy and not more than 48 months` levy.
 Section 16D of the 1995 Act reads: 
Where an offence under this Act or any regulations made thereunder is committed by a body corporate, and it is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any act or default on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
 Section 5(1) of the 1995 Act reads: 
No person shall employ a foreign worker unless he has obtained in respect of the foreign worker a valid work permit which allows the foreign worker to work for him.
 Section 5(4) of the 1995 Act reads: 
Any person who fails to comply with or contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall -
 
(a) be liable on conviction to a fine of an amount of not less than 24 months` levy and not more than 48 months` levy or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both; and 
(b) on a second or subsequent conviction, be punished - 
(i) in the case of an individual, with imprisonment for a term of not less than one month and not more than one year and shall also be liable to a fine of an amount of not less than 24 months` levy and not more than 48 months` levy; and 
(ii) in the case of a body corporate, with a fine of an amount of not less than 48 months` levy and not more than 96 months` levy.
 Section 5(9) of the 1995 Act reads: 
For the purpose of this section, `employ` means to engage or use the service of any person, whether under a contract of service or otherwise, with or without salary.
 46.Having perused the relevant sections of the 1991 as well as the 1995 Act, I agreed with the submissions of the DPP. The only difference between the 1991 and the 1995 Acts is that the 1995 Act has incorporated into it the amendments made to the 1991 Act by the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Act (Act 37 of 1995). So far as the offence in the instant case is concerned, its definition has remained the same save for the following changes: (a). In the 1991 Act, the offence of employing a worker without a valid work permit by the body corporate must be attributable to the neglect of the accused. In the 1995 Act, the offence by the body corporate must be attributable to the act or default of the accused. I do not propose to go into an exhaustive or indepth examination of the term `default` in the context of the 1995 Act. Suffice it to say that in interpreting the term, it is useful to keep in mind the natural and ordinary meaning of the word `default` as a working guide, albeit with the qualification that this is not exhaustive. For present purposes, it suffices to note that one of the meanings of default as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary is:
 
Failure to act; 
 neglect
 [emphasis added].
 It is clear therefore that the phrase `act or default` is wider than and includes the term `neglect` (b). In the 1991 Act, the term . `employ` was not defined. However, the courts, in interpreting the term, would look to the definition of `employ` in s 2 of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) for guidance: see 
PP v Tham Kwai Lian
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 293
 , 
PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 158
 . Section 2 states that `employ` means to engage or use the service of any person and to pay such person for services rendered or work done or to remunerate such person on a piece rate or on a commission basis. In the 1995 Act, the term `employ` is defined at s 5(9) to mean to engage or use the service of any person, whether under a contract of service or otherwise, with or without salary. This definition was adopted so that it would no longer be possible for errant employers to claim that they did not employ the illegal foreign workers because they did not pay the workers any salary or that they were merely trying out the workers: see the Second Reading of the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Bill by the Minister for Labour, Mr Lee Boon Yang on 1 November 1995. The definition of the term `employ` in the 1995 Act is therefore wider than in the 1991 Act.
 (c). Under the 1991 Act, an officer of a body corporate would be liable for the offence in question only when the body corporate committed an offence under s 5(1) of the 1991 Act. Under the 1995 Act, an officer of a body corporate would be liable for the offence in question when the body corporate committed an offence under the 1995 Act or any regulations made thereunder.
 (d). Under the 1991 Act, on a second or subsequent conviction, an individual and a body corporate would be liable to be punished in the same way. Both would be liable for a term of imprisonment of not less than one month and not more than one year and would also be liable to pay a fine of an amount of not less than 24 months` levy and not more than 48 months` levy. It was eventually realised that the punishment of imprisonment was not apt in the case of a body corporate. Under the 1995 Act, therefore, an individual and a body corporate would be dealt with differently. An individual would be liable for a term of imprisonment of not less than one month and not more than one year and would also be liable to pay a fine of an amount of not less than 24 months` levy and not more than 48 months` levy, whereas a body corporate would be liable to pay a fine of an amount of not less than 48 months` levy and not more than 96 months` levy.
 47.It was clear from the above comparison that the sole effect of the amendments to the offence in question between 1991 and 1995 was to broaden the ambit of the offence. In other words, the same facts which would support a conviction under s 5(6) read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1991 Act would also sustain a conviction under s 16D read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1995 Act. As such, I did not see why the accused`s conviction under s 5(6) read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1991 Act should not count as a previous conviction under the 1995 Act, so as to make the accused`s current conviction under s 16D read with s 5(1) and punishable under s 5(4) of the 1995 Act a second conviction which would attract the sentence of mandatory imprisonment under s 5(4)(b)(i) of the 1995 Act. Clearly, the intention of Parliament in re-enacting s 5(4)(b)(i) of the 1995 Act was to ensure stricter punishment for individuals who repeatedly committed the offence in question, and it would be an absurd denial of Parliament`s intention if in considering whether the accused`s current conviction was a second conviction, the courts were to ignore his past conviction on the mere basis that that he had been convicted under an earlier edition of the Act which defined the offence in question more narrowly than the 1995 Act. I therefore allowed the prosecution`s appeal against sentence.
 48.
 The sentence 
 
Under s 5(4)(b)(i) of the 1995 Act, the accused was liable for a term of imprisonment of not less than one month and not more than one year, and a fine of not less than 24 months` levy and not more than 48 months` levy.
 49.I noted that there are four limbs to the offence under s 16D of the 1995 Act (employment of a foreign worker without a work permit by a body corporate with the consent or connivance of, or attributable to the act or default of an officer of the body corporate). I took into consideration the fact that the accused was charged under the `default` limb of the offence under s 16D, which is the least culpable of the four limbs. I also took into consideration the fact that the period for which Chin was employed without a work permit and which was attributable to the accused`s default was extremely short. I also took into account, however, the fact that the period of employment would probably have been longer had it not been curtailed by the raid carried out by the employment inspectors on 14 November 1996. In the result, I sentenced the accused to one month`s imprisonment, in addition to the fine of 48 months` levy amounting to $15,840 imposed by the court below, which the accused had already paid.",1999-01-18 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Facts and case history 
 1.The facts are that the respondent was seen by police officers beating a red light in his motor vehicle along East Coast Parkway on 9 April 1981 at 10.10pm. He was stopped by the officers, who, upon examining him, suspected him to be driving under the influence of alcohol. He was arrested, brought to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and subjected to a physical examination, and his blood alcohol level was tested. He was found to have 198 g of ethanol per 100 ml of blood, which exceeded the (then) statutory limit of 110 g of ethanol per 100 ml of blood. The respondent was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol to such an extent as to render him incapable of having proper control over the vehicle under s 29(1) of the Road Traffic Act (then Cap 92, 1973 Ed).
 2.He was tried in the district court on 29 March, 6 April and 13 April 1985 and acquitted by district judge Rahim Jalil at the close of the prosecution`s case on 22 April 1985. His defence was not called. The district judge found that the prosecution`s evidence contradicted itself, and that accordingly the presumption that he was unable to exercise proper control over the vehicle was rebutted. The district judge`s reasoning is set out in further detail below.
 3.The Public Prosecutor lodged a notice of appeal against the district judge`s decision on 23 April 1985. The grounds of decision were released on 30 May 1985 and the petition of appeal was filed on 18 June 1985.
 4.The appeal was fixed for hearing on 20 November 1985. The respondent did not appear for the hearing.
 5.The appeal was then re-fixed for 12 March 1986. The respondent was sent a notification of the second date by registered post, which was sent to his address at 2041 Changi Village S 1749. The notice was unclaimed. The respondent was absent at the appeal and a warrant of arrest was issued by the High Court on 12 March 1986.
 6.Letters were sent to the Officer-in-Command of the Criminal Record Office, CID by the High Court asking for updates as to the action taken on the warrant of arrest on 4 May 1988, 20 March 1990, 4 June 1994 and 4 June 1998. There is no evidence of any reply to these letters on the part of the CID.
 7.The respondent was arrested on 13 November 1998 when he attended at the traffic police for a different matter. He was arrested pursuant to the warrant issued on 12 March 1986. On the same day, he applied to be released on bail.
 8.The respondent appeared in person before Chan Seng Onn JC. He explained that he did not receive the notice of the hearing fixed for 20 November 1985 because his shop at 2041 Changi Village had already closed down at that time. Thereafter he went to Australia where he remained until 1988. He was unaware of the appeal against his acquittal, or of the warrant for his arrest. The learned judicial commissioner granted the respondent bail in the sum of $5,000 in one surety.
 9.The appeal was then fixed for hearing before me on 3 December 1998. The respondent appeared in person. I dismissed the Public Prosecutor`s appeal and now give my reasons.
 10.
 History of legislation 
 
It is first convenient to set out the history of the provision under which the respondent was charged. In the 1970 Revised Edition of the Road Traffic Act (then Cap 92), the provision appeared as s 28 which read: 
(1) Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of drink or a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, and in the case of a second or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both such fine and imprisonment.
 11.Under Revision 1/73, the provision was renumbered as s 29 with no other amendments. In 1976, s 30B was introduced to provide that: 
Any person who has been arrested under sections 29 or 30 of this Act shall be presumed to be incapable of having proper control of a motor vehicle if the specimen of blood provided by him under s 30A of this Act is certified by a medical practitioner to have a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 110 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 milllitres of blood.
 However, it was still open to an accused person to rebut the presumption by demonstrating that he was capable of exercising proper control over the vehicle even if his blood specimen contained an alcohol level over the prescribed limit. See my decision in 
Joseph Roland v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 179
 .
 12.Section 29 of the 1973 edition was subsequently renumbered as s 67 in the 1985 Revised Edition (Cap 276). The maximum fine for a first conviction was enhanced from $500 to $1,000 and the ceiling of six months` imprisonment maintained. By Act 7/90, the penalties under s 67 were further enhanced to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 for a first conviction, and of not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 for a second conviction.
 13.Section 30B was renumbered as s 70 in the 1985 Revised edition and, by Act 9/85, the prescribed blood alcohol limit under s 70 was revised downwards from 110 mg/100 ml to 80 mg/100ml.
 14.The current s 67 was introduced by the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 1996 and totally revamped the operation of the section. It now prescribes that: 
(1) Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place - 
(a) is unfit to drive in that he is under the influence of drink or of a drug or an intoxicating substance to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle; or 
(b) has so much alcohol in his body that the proportion of it in his breath or blood exceeds the prescribed limit,
 
shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.
 15.The presumption under s 70 was abolished and fresh provisions governing the taking of breath tests introduced as the new ss 70 and 71 in the 1997 Revised Edition of the Act. This marked a sea-change in the operation of the drink driving provisions. Whereas in 1985 having more than the prescribed limit of alcohol merely gave rise to a rebuttable presumption, under the current legislation the proof of that fact alone leads to a conviction, regardless of whether the accused was in fact capable of controlling the vehicle. Accordingly, today, even if the accused can prove he has an exceptional tolerance for alcohol, and that he was not inebriated at the time of his arrest, he will still be guilty of the offence.
 16.
 Effect of delay in prosecution 
 
The offence in question was allegedly committed in 1981 when the accused was aged 39. He was, at the hearing of appeal, 57. There was a lapse of more than 17 years since the date of the offence, and of about 13 years since the filing of the appeal.
 17.In view of the fact that the respondent appeared in person, I took it upon myself to pose the question whether the appeal ought to be allowed in view of that delay. In particular, I was concerned whether to exercise my discretion to stay the criminal proceedings on the grounds that it would not now be possible to conduct a fair trial.
 18.In 
Attorney General`s Reference (No 1 of 1990)
 
[1992] QB 630
[1992] 3 All ER 169
, it was held by the English Court of Criminal Appeal (per Lord Lane CJ) that: 
(a) The jurisdiction to stay criminal proceedings on the ground of delay was exceptional even where the delay could be said to be unjustifiable; and 
(b) A stay should rarely be imposed in the absence of any fault on the part of the complainant or prosecution and should never be imposed where the delay was due merely to the complexity of the case or was caused or contributed to by the actions of the defendant himself; and 
(c) Furthermore, a stay ought not to be imposed unless the defendant showed on the balance of probabilities that owing to the delay he would suffer serious prejudice to the extent that no fair trial could be held and that the continuance of the prosecution amounted to a misuse of process. In assessing whether there was likely to be prejudice and, if so, whether it could properly be described as serious, the court should consider whether any prejudice and unfairness could be dealt with in the course of the trial process itself, either by ensuring that all relevant factual issues arising from the delay were placed before the jury together with appropriate directions by the judge or under the judge`s power at common law and under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to regulate the admissibility of evidence.
 19.
 Attorney General`s Reference (No 1 of 1990) 
 was cited with approval by See Kee Oon DJ in 
 Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v PP 
 (decision of District Court dated 22 June 1998 in DACs Nos 7675, 7676 and 15657 of 1998). See Kee Oon DJ made express reference in that case to the opinion of Brennan J (as he then was) in the High Court of Austrlia`s decision in 
Jago v District Court of New South Wales
 
[1989] 
168 CLR 23
. Brennan J had considered that one of the main reasons why the courts were so reluctant to grant permanent stays in criminal proceedings was because the victim of the crime would be aggrieved if justice was not done. However, Brennan J did not consider how that principle would operate where, as in the present case, the crime has no victim.
 20.The Privy Council upheld the principle that the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that he should suffer prejudice in 
Gin (George Tan Soon) v Judge Cameron
 
[1992] 2 AC 205
[1993] 2 All ER 493
, rejecting the contention that that where there was an inexcusably long delay, the defendant`s burden was discharged and it was upon the prosecution to show that prejudice did not in fact follow from the delay.
 21.That principle was elaborated on by the Privy Council in 
A-G of Hong Kong v Cheung Wai-bun
 
[1994] 1 AC 1
[1993] 2 All ER 510
. In that case, the prosecution was instituted in 1992 in respect of commercial fraud offences committed between 1979 and 1982, leading to the defendant`s arrest in 1988. Their Lordships held that, if the delay had been caused by the defendant`s own conduct, or the defendant had contributed to the delay by committing further offences to conceal his principal offence, thereby delaying its discovery, a stay ought not to be granted. On the facts, however, it was found that the defendant had not contributed to the delay, and that as the delay would prejudice a fair trial, the court below had been right to acquit the defendant.
 22.Two distinct themes recur in all the cases. The court must concern itself with two questions: firstly, who caused the delay and, secondly, is a fair trial possible? If the delay was caused by the respondent, through his deliberate action or by his having avoided the authorities, very little sympathy is shown. If, however, the delay was not the respondent`s fault, and a fair trial is now impossible, a stay ought, barring some other reason, to be granted.
 23.It is true that these cases all concerned a delay between the commission of the offence and the trial. There are, to my knowledge, no reported cases of a delay between the trial and the appeal. However, I took the view that the same principles applied in the present case because, had I allowed the appeal, the matter would have been set for further dates in the Subordinate Courts and the respondent called upon to enter his defence.
 24.I first propose to consider the likelihood of the respondent receiving a fair trial.
 25.
 Is a fair trial possible? 
 
As I have pointed out, there has been a considerable change in the legislation since 1985. Whilst the amendments do not have retrospective effect, I had my doubts whether any purpose could be served in reviving a prosecution under a dead law. Furthermore, the considerable revisions to the maximum fine for a first conviction (from $500 in 1970 to $5,000 in 1996), suggested that the offence is viewed much more seriously today than it was so many years ago. Changes in judicial or public opinion about the offence may now operate to the accused`s prejudice. These I considered to be relevant, though minor, factors to take into account.
 26.What I was more concerned with was whether it would at all be possible for the accused to conduct his defence. Under the current legislation the facts of this case would have warranted a summary conviction. All that is required is proof that the respondent`s blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limits, a fact concerning which there was ample undisputed evidence.
 27.However, if I had allowed the appeal, the respondent would have been entitled to raise under the old law the defence that he was in fact capable of exercising proper control over the vehicle notwithstanding his high blood alcohol level. Criminal liability would therefore turn upon one key factual issue, requiring the judge to assess the credibility of the witnesses` impressions of the respondent`s state of drunkenness (as opposed to a mere investigation into whether or not the prescribed blood alcohol limit was exceeded). In that respect, I took the view that a fair trial may well be impossible in view of the lengthy delay.
 28.Firstly, if the matter could be set down before the same district judge, it is against all probability that he could recall with any accuracy his impressions of the witnesses he heard in 1985. If he were to hear only the defence, but to rely on his memory of the prosecution`s evidence, it is inconceivable that he would be able to consider both parties` evidence on an even keel, given the lapse of time, and accordingly, a re-trial might have been the only means of securing a fair hearing. If, on the other hand, the matter were set down before a different judge, I would also have had to order a re-trial, since the new judge would have to formulate his own impressions of the prosecution witnesses` credibility. It would not have been possible for the judge to make a fair adjudication based on his having heard the defence in court, but having only the written record of the prosecution`s case. Either way, a trial de novo would have been appropriate.
 29.However, in view of the enormous time lapse, I had real doubts as to whether a fair re-trial was at all possible since there was nothing to suggest that the four key witnesses to the trial, apart from the respondent, were still alive, living in Singapore or amenable to being brought to Singapore without unreasonable delay or expense, or even competent to give evidence. More importantly, I think it very doubtful whether they would be able to recall the events in 1981 with any accuracy.
 30.PW6, Miss Siew Wai Fun, conducted the blood test and found it to contain 198 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood (the legal limit being at the time 100 mg), thus giving rise to the presumption under the then s 30B. Proof of the document stating the test results aside, I do not think PW6`s absence or presence at a re-trial would have had significant impact. As I have said, her evidence only went to raising the presumption which the respondent would now have to rebut.
 31.The next important witness was Dr Tan Kah Wee, the doctor who examined the respondent upon his arrival at Tan Tock Seng Hospital in the late hours of 9 April 1981. It is of no small significance that, even at the time when the matter originally came to trial in 1985, she had already left the employ of the hospital and returned to Malaysia. The hospital records signed by her were proved by another hospital employee who did not attend to the respondent personally, PW1, Ms Linda Pilo, a medical officer attached to the A&E Department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital in 1985. All she was able to do was to verify Dr Tan`s signature and to repeat the contents of the report in which Dr Tan stated that the respondent was observed to be in a mild state of intoxication. If the doctor who examined the respondent was not available even in 1985, I have serious doubts if she would be available for a new trial in 1998. Even if she were available, I have equally serious doubts whether she would be of any greater use to the court than PW1 was in 1985 - her recollection of such a minor incident in 1981 would be poor at best.
 32.Though PW1 also gave evidence in cross-examination that a high degree of alcohol content could, depending on a person`s alcohol tolerance, be consistent with only a mild state of intoxication, this was opinion evidence and could be easily solicited from any competent expert today.
 33.The other key evidence relating to the question whether the respondent was able to properly control his vehicle was given by the arresting officers, PW5 (PC Chin Kok Weng) and PW7 (SC Azman bin Mohamed). They gave evidence of that the respondent had an unsteady gait. In cross-examination, however, PW5 and PW7 gave evidence that the car was being driven in a steady manner at the time of the arrest (see pp 18, 27 and 30 of Notes of Evidence). PW7 also said in cross-examination that, although the respondent was swinging his arms, he had a steady walk and was not stumbling (see p 29 of Notes of Evidence). PW5, when cross-examined on the respondent`s manner of walking replied, to the majority of the questions, `I can`t remember` (see pp 15-16 of Notes of Evidence).
 34.Again, I had the same misgivings about the reliability of evidence which would be given by PW5 and PW7 in a re-trial as I had about the evidence which would be given by Dr Tan Kah Wee or PW1. This was a relatively minor, routine incident. If PW5 was unable to give useful answers to questions posed in 1985, I doubted if he could be of any more assistance to the court in 1998, assuming he could be located by the prosecution.
 35.It was on the basis of the responses solicited in cross-examination from PW1, PW5 and PW7, together with the medical report stating that the respondent only suffered from mild intoxication, that the district judge acquitted the respondent - he considered that the prosecution`s own evidence had contradicted itself. Undoubtedly, if I had allowed the appeal, the same issue would vex a court hearing a re-trial. And, any court hearing the matter today would be in a worse off position than the district judge in 1985 owing to the big question mark over the witnesses` ability to recall the events with any accuracy.
 36.Perhaps more importantly, if the respondent was, at the close of the prosecution`s case, called upon to enter his defence, I considered it very unlikely that he would be able to find a medical expert willing or able to testify as to his alcohol tolerance in 1981 or even 1985. Similarly, if he wanted to rely on personal testimony from friends or family as to his drinking fortitude, he might suffer similar difficulties as the prosecution in locating accurate, reliable witnesses.
 37.In those circumstances, I did not think that a fair trial was possible. That leads me to the next question, namely, who occasioned the delay making a fair trial impossible?
 38.
 Responsibility for delay 
 
Having examined the record closely, it appeared to me that the delay was occasioned by a procedural error committed by the court below. For ease of reference, it is first convenient to set out the relevant provisions. Section 254 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that: 
(1) If at the hearing of the appeal the respondent is not present and the court is not satisfied that the notice of appeal was duly served upon him, the court shall not make any order in the matter of the appeal adverse to or to the prejudice of the respondent, but shall adjourn the hearing of the appeal to a future day for his appearance and issue the requisite notice to him for service through the Registrar. 
(2) If the service of the last-mentioned notice on the respondent cannot be effected, the court shall proceed to hear the appeal in his absence.
 39.The High Court judge also has a power to issue a warrant of arrest under s 255: 
When an appeal is presented against an acquittal the High Court may issue a warrant directing that the accused shall be arrested and brought before it and may commit him to prison pending the disposal of the appeal or admit him to bail.
 40.The appeal fixed for 20 November 1985 was duly adjourned under s 254(1) and a registrar`s notice sent regarding the re-fixed hearing on 12 March 1986. In my view, the warrant of arrest should have been issued on 20 November 1985 with a view to bringing the respondent to court for the hearing on 12 March 1986. If then the respondent was still absent on 12 March 1986, the appeal should have been heard in his absence pursuant to s 254(2).
 41.Instead, no warrant was (on the evidence before me) issued on 20 November 1985. The warrant was only issued on 12 March 1986. However, this yielded no results since the appeal was never re-fixed for hearing after 12 March 1986. Consequently, the court was never presented with the opportunity to exercise its powers under s 254(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code to hear the appeal in the respondent`s absence.
 42.Had the court gone on to exercise its discretion to consider the merits of the appeal in the respondent`s absence and had it decided the matter in the prosecutor`s favour, the matter would have been re-set for trial in 1986. The delay would therefore have been avoided. If the defendant was still absent from trial, he could have been convicted in his absence (albeit subject to a right of appeal if he truly had no notice of the proceedings against him).
 43.What is especially disturbing about the present case is that the CID apparently took no steps to execute the warrant, since it lay dormant for over 13 years, despite repeated reminder notices sent to it by the High Court. It was only by chance, when the respondent was attending to another road traffic offence, that he came to be arrested.
 44.I was inclined, on a balance of probabilities, to accept the respondent`s explanation why he did not receive notice of the appeal. There was nothing to suggest that he had absconded to avoid the appeal. On the contrary, the evidence suggested otherwise. Firstly, he was quite happy to stand trial in 1985. Secondly, if he had been aware of the warrant out for his arrest, he surely would have persuaded someone to attend to the traffic summons on his behalf rather than to court danger by paying it himself. It appeared to me that the delay was entirely caused by the prosecution`s (or judge`s) procedural error, together with an incomprehensible lapse on the part of the police in failing to execute the warrant of arrest.
 45.The fact of the matter is that the error committed by the court, together with 13 years of non-action by the investigative authorities, placed the defendant in a position where he might have had to defend an action brought against him in respect of a crime allegedly committed almost 18 years ago, and for which he had already been acquitted once. That was a position I found most unattractive because a fair trial was, for the reasons I have already set out, not possible.
 46.Even bearing in mind that this would be an exceptional exercise of my jurisdiction, I cannot think of any more appropriate case in which I might be called upon to exercise my discretion to order a stay. Both factors enunciated by the English Court of Appeal in 
 Attorney General`s Reference (No 1 of 1990) 
 weighed in the respondent`s favour: firstly, the delay was occasioned by the prosecution; and secondly, in view of the length of that delay, a fair trial was not possible. To allow the appeal would have set an awkward precedent for the prosecution of sleeping cases. It would also have sent out the wrong message to the police concerning their attitude to outstanding warrants.
 47.
 Merits of the appeal 
 
In view of my foregoing conclusions, I consider it unnecessary to examine the merits of the appeal, which concerned whether the district judge correctly applied his mind to the proper operation of s 188 of the Criminal Procedure Code as interpreted by the House of Lords in

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 In this case, the appellant prosecuted the respondent by way of a private summons in the magistrate`s court on the charges of insulting her modesty and criminal intimidation under ss 509 and 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) respectively. After a two-day trial, the trial judge convicted the respondent and sentenced him to a fine of $2,000 on each charge. At the close of the proceedings, counsel for the appellant made an application for prosecution costs under s 401(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). The trial judge refused to grant the application. The sole issue arising in this appeal was whether the trial judge erred in refusing to exercise her discretion under s 401(1)(a) of the CPC to award the costs of prosecution to the appellant.
 2.
 Preliminary objections of the Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) 
 
Before going into the merits of the appeal, it was necessary for me to consider two preliminary objections raised by the DPP to withdraw the appeal. The first objection was that the appellant, as a private person, has no right of audience before the High Court by virtue of s 336(6) of the CPC. The second objection was that the Public Prosecutor has a recognised right to intervene in any criminal proceedings and he could, in the exercise of his discretion, intervene to withdraw the present appeal. I will deal with the latter objection first.
 3.
 Public Prosecutor`s right of intervention 
 
The DPP submitted that the Public Prosecutor has the power to intervene in any criminal proceedings. Section 336(1) of the CPC provides that the Public Prosecutor `shall have the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings` under the CPC. Such power is also entrenched in art 35(8) of the Constitution which reads: 
The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or 
 discontinue any proceedings
 for any offence. [Emphasis added.]
 Thus, he submitted that the Public Prosecutor could in his discretion intervene to discontinue the appeal.
 4.The power of intervention was judicially recognised by Lai Kew Chai J in 
Hawa bte Haji Mohamed Hussain v Miranda
 
[1988] SLR 720
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 397
 . In that case, the appellant instituted private summons proceedings against the respondent and the respondent was tried and convicted of the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to the appellant. The magistrate gave the respondent a conditional discharge for one year. The appellant was dissatisfied with the decision and lodged an appeal against the decision under s 247(1) of the CPC. On appeal, the DPP submitted that the notice of appeal ought to be withdrawn as the Public Prosecutor was intervening to withdraw the appeal. The appellant argued that she not only had a right of appeal under s 247(1) but a right of audience either by herself in person or by counsel.
 5.The court allowed the intervention and dismissed the appeal. It was held that, by virtue of s 336(1) of the CPC, the `control and direction of ... proceedings under` the CPC lay with the Public Prosecutor and the term `proceedings` included criminal appeals. Thus, the Public Prosecutor could in the exercise of his discretion under art 35(8) of the Constitution intervene and withdraw the appeal. Lai Kew Chai J further reasoned at p 398: 
Further, as a matter of principle, it must be recognized, as it was in 
Ponniah v Lim
 
[1960] MLJ 152
 , that the interests of the State in a criminal matter which are entrusted to the Public Prosecutor are not always the same as those of a complainant who may allow his `private passions and prejudices to creep in the conduct` of a criminal appeal.
 6.In 
PP v Norzian bin Bintat
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 462
 , it was also noted by the Chief Justice at p 467: 
It is clear from s 336(1) of the CPC that, whether in a public or a private prosecution, the Public Prosecutor shall have control and direction of the criminal prosecution. There can be little doubt that even in the case of a private prosecution, if the Public Prosecutor is not satisfied with the conduct of the prosecution, he may intervene and take over the prosecution. This was so even before the enactment of the Criminal Procedure Code in 1900 and before the Constitution came into effect. It can be seen from the case of 
R v Sultan Mahomed
 
[1884] 2 Ky 116
. There, an intervention by the Attorney General to enter a nolle prosequi in a private prosecution, against the wishes of the private prosecutor, was upheld. This was a decision from Penang, which was then part of the Straits Settlements.
 7.Therefore, the case law on this preliminary objection is clear. The Public Prosecutor can exercise his discretion to withdraw the appeal and on this ground alone, the appeal can be dismissed.
 8.
 Appellant`s right of audience before the High Court 
 
The DPP further submitted that, apart from the right of the Public Prosecutor to intervene in criminal appeals, the appellant did not have a right of audience before the High Court by virtue of s 336(6) of the CPC.
 9.The relevant subsections of s 336 of the CPC state: 
(1) The Attorney-General shall be the Public Prosecutor and shall have the 
 control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this Code. 
 
(2) ... 
(3) Subject to this section, the Attorney-General may appoint any officers or persons to assist him or to act as his deputies in the performance of any of the functions or duties of the Public Prosecutor under this Code or under any written law and may assign to them their functions and duties. 
(4) The Public Prosecutor or the Solicitor-General or a person appointed a deputy under subsection (3) may authorise any advocate to act for him as Public Prosecutor in the conduct of any case or prosecution in court or in any part of such conduct. 
(5) ... 
(6) 
 No person shall appear on behalf of the Attorney-General in any criminal appeal 
 or on any point of law reserved under Chapter XXIX 
 other than the Public Prosecutor or the Solicitor-General or a deputy appointed under subsection (3) or an advocate authorised under subsection (4). 
 
(7) ... 
(8) Nothing in this section shall be held to preclude private persons or any officer of any Government department from appearing in person or by advocate to prosecute in summary cases before a Magistrate`s Court or in summary non-seizable cases before a District Court. [Emphasis added.]
 10.The DPP contended that, while a private person`s right to prosecute summary cases in the subordinate courts is preserved under s 336(8), the provision is silent on the conduct of appeals by such a person. Section 336(1) confers on the Public Prosecutor the control and direction of all criminal prosecutions and proceedings under the CPC. He submitted therefore that, by the operation of s 336(6), the Public Prosecutor would have such control and direction over criminal appeals by preventing any person from appearing on behalf of the Public Prosecutor on appeal unless authorised to do so.
 11.He relied on the following two cases in support of his proposition. The issue relating to the right of audience of a private prosecutor in the appellate court was considered in 
R v Schefelaar
 
[1939] MLJ 45
 , albeit by way of obiter dictum. In that case, the Official Assignee secured a conviction of the respondent who had committed an offence under the Bankruptcy Ordinance. The Official Assignee appealed against the sentence. The respondent argued that the Official Assignee had no right to appear before the High Court by virtue of s 402(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (which was in pari materia with our s 336(6)). McElwaine CJ expressed the view that the Crown was the prosecutor in this case and implied that the requirements under s 402(6) would be applicable. However, he did not have to decide on this issue as the Official Assignee subsequently produced a letter of authorisation from the Public Prosecutor to appear on his behalf in the appeal.
 12.In 
Ponniah v Lim
 
[1960] MLJ 152
 , the court had to determine who the proper respondent ought to be in an appeal by the accused person who was prosecuted by way of a private summons. The court followed the dicta from several Indian authorities which highlighted the possible divergence of the interests of the State and the complainant. The courts were mindful of the possibility of `private passions and prejudices` creeping into the conduct of a criminal trial by a private prosecutor which would not only be against public policy but would also be unfair to the accused person. Thus, the court held that the Public Prosecutor and not the complainant was the proper respondent in such appeals.
 13.Hence, the DPP submitted that the appellant had no right of audience before the High Court because she, being a private person, did not fall into any of the categories of persons described in s 336(6) and she had not received any authorisation from the Public Prosecutor to appear before the High Court.
 14.In my view, the analysis taken by the DPP was somewhat over-simplified. He failed to consider s 247 which confers on any person who is dissatisfied with any judgment, sentence or order made in the Subordinate Courts a right of appeal to the High Court. Section 247(1) reads: 
Subject to sections 242, 244 and 245 any person who is dissatisfied with any judgment, sentence or order pronounced by any District Court or Magistrate`s Court in a criminal case or matter to which he is a party may prefer an appeal to the High Court against that judgment, sentence or order in respect of any error in law or in fact or, in an appeal against sentence, on the ground that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive or inadequate ...
 15.Section 242 has since been repealed. Section 244 provides that where an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted, there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence and s 245 confers on the Public Prosecutor an exclusive right of appeal against an accused person`s acquittal. Subject to these two qualifications, a private prosecutor has a right of appeal to the High Court under s 247 as he is clearly a `party` in a criminal case.
 16.It would appear to be anomalous at first sight that a private prosecutor, who has a right of appeal, nevertheless does not have a right of audience in the appellate court if he fails to obtain the Public Prosecutor`s authorisation to appear on his behalf on appeal in accordance with s 336(6). One way of rationalising this is to say that the private prosecutor is only delegated with the power to prosecute by the Public Prosecutor and such a delegation of power can be revoked at the discretion of the Public Prosecutor. Support for this view can be found in Tan Yock Lin, 
 Criminal Procedure 
 Vol 2, at [para ] 603 of Chapter XIX where the author suggests that: 
... the private prosecutor is a delegated prosecutor and prosecutes at the sufferance of the Public Prosecutor. His remaining the person dissatisfied must depend on the continuing validity of the delegation; and if that is withdrawn, he would not longer be a person dissatisfied who would have a right of appeal.
 17.In this respect, a Malaysian High Court decision in 
Hardial Singh v Faridah bte Haron & Ors
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 465
  is instructive as the provisions interpreted by the court are largely similar to ours. The court was faced with the similar question of whether a private complainant who has appealed against the decision of the magistrate has a right of audience before the High Court in the criminal appeal.
 18.In that case, the appellant instituted a private summons against the respondents but the trial judge struck out the summonses against them on the ground that she had no jurisdiction to proceed with the trial of the respondents. The appellant appealed against the order but the High Court dismissed the appeal on the day of the hearing because of the appellant`s absence. The appellant then filed an application to reinstate the appeal but the DPP objected to the application on the ground that a private individual cannot appear on behalf of the Public Prosecutor in a criminal appeal.
 19.KC Vohrah J considered the role of the Public Prosecutor in cases of private prosecutions and concluded that the control and direction of such private prosecutions remained with the Public Prosecutor. He reasoned at p 469: 
Although in a private prosecution a private person or his advocate may conduct the prosecution of a non-seizable offence, the conduct of such prosecution does not pass out from the hands of the Public Prosecutor as the Public Prosecutor under s 376(i) has ... the control and direction of all criminal prosecutions and proceedings under the Code. ...
 
It is clear that if the Public Prosecutor or any of his officers appears in lieu of the complainant in a private summons and the Public Prosecutor is dissatisfied with any decision of the magistrate he may appeal under s 307(i). The fact that he or any of his officers does not appear does not mean he has relinquished control and direction over the conduct of the prosecution; he has control and direction as to what the next step ought to be after the case is concluded before the magistrate. And he may appeal in lieu of the private complainant. ...
 
Procedurally, however, the Public Prosecutor cannot make objection to the Registrar against an appeal which has been filed by a private complainant. ... The only point in time when he can re-assert control and direction of the criminal appeal would be at the hearing of the appeal before the High Court judge. To my mind the Public Prosecutor, as a matter of public policy, should as far as possible have the control and direction of all criminal appeals in the role of appellants where private complainants have filed appeals lest the personal vindictiveness of private parties obsure [sic] the merits of the appeals.
 20.While it is accepted that the Public Prosecutor has the ultimate control and direction of all criminal proceedings, the DPP`s first preliminary objection raises the more difficult issue of whether a private prosecutor appealing in person should have a right of audience before the High Court in cases where the Public Prosecutor chooses not to intervene. If the DPP`s submission is taken to its logical conclusion, it would mean that a private prosecutor appearing in person would never have the right of audience in the High Court. This is because he would not fall within any of the enumerated categories of persons in s 336(6). On one view, it could be argued that it is Parliament`s intention that the Public Prosecutor supervises the appeal process through the mechanism of s 336(6) by either appointing a deputy or an authorised advocate to conduct the appeal. On another view, it would appear to be odd that a private prosecutor who could have prosecuted in person at first instance in accordance with s 336(8) and who has a right of appeal under s 247(1) nevertheless does not have the right of audience in the High Court.
 21.In this regard, I am not considering the cases where the Public Prosecutor decides to intervene and take over the conduct of the proceedings. In those cases, it is clearly justifiable to oust the private prosecutor`s right of audience in favour of the Public Prosecutor who ultimately has the control and direction of all criminal prosecutions and proceedings under the CPC. However, in cases where the Public Prosecutor decides not to intervene and the private prosecutor decides to appeal in person, then, based on the DPP`s submission, such an appellant would also not have a right of audience in the High Court. In my view, it is difficult to justify why such an appellant should be effectively denied the right of appeal. Under s 249 of the CPC, the record of proceedings, the grounds of decision together with a copy of the notice of appeal and petition of appeal would be transmitted to the Public Prosecutor by the court appealed from. Presumably, by choosing not to intervene in the appeal, the Public Prosecutor would have decided that it would not be against public interest to allow the appeal to proceed. If that is the case, such a private prosecutor ought not to be denied the right of audience before the High Court to have the merits of his appeal determined by the court.
 22.One way of reconciling this difficulty can be gleaned from the approach taken in 
 Hardial Singh v Faridah bte Haron & Ors 
. The judge drew a distinction between the right of appeal and the right of audience in the High Court. He held that if the private prosecutor has the right of appeal, as a corollary, he also has the right of audience in the High Court on the hearing of the appeal. Otherwise, the right of appeal becomes an illusory right. However, if the Public Prosecutor decides to intervene in the appeal, then only those categories of persons enumerated in s 378 (which is similar to our s 336(6)) would have the right of audience. In such a case, the Public Prosecutor `steps into the shoes of the private complainant qua appellant` and the private complainant`s right of audience in the appeal would thereby be ousted.
 23.The main difficulty with this approach is that it contemplates the possibility of a private prosecutor appearing in person on appeal even though he does not fall within the enumerated categories of persons under s 336(6). Thus, if such an approach is to be adopted, s 336(6) must be interpreted as a provision which merely defines the categories of persons who may represent the Public Prosecutor in an appeal.
 24.In my view, it would not be necessary to decide on this point for the purposes of this appeal as the appeal can be disposed of on the basis of the second preliminary objection that the Public Prosecutor has exercised his discretion to discontinue the proceedings. This would leave open the question of whether a private prosecutor appealing in person has a right of audience before the High Court when the Public Prosecutor decides not to be involved in the proceedings.
 25.
 Substantive merits of the appeal 
 
Even if the appeal was not dismissed on the basis of the second preliminary objection by the DPP, I am of the view that the appeal had no merit.
 26.Section 401(1)(a) states: 
The court before which a person is convicted of any crime or offence may, in its discretion, make ... the following orders against him:
 
(a) an order for the payment by him of the costs of his prosecution or such part thereof as the court directs
 27.The guidelines governing the exercise of discretion were considered by the High Court in 
Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 930
 . In that case, the appellant was convicted in the magistrate`s court of five charges under s 72 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332) for making or having in his possession any instrument for counterfeiting a trade mark. The appellant was ordered to pay a reasonable amount for the costs of prosecution because, in conducting his defence, he had persisted in challenging peripheral issues and the genuineness of each exhibit with the consequence that an expert witness was sent from Japan to testify. On the facts, the numerous challenges mounted by the defence were unnecessary and extravagant as the defence was innocent possession.
 28.In dismissing his appeal against the order for costs, the Chief Justice said at p 937: 
In my opinion, this was an appropriate exercise of the magistrate`s discretion. Of course, it is not in every case that such costs should be ordered. In exercising its discretion, however, the court is entitled to take all the circumstances into account, including the strength of the case against the accused, his knowledge of this and his conduct of his defence. An accused has a right to plead not guilty and to conduct his defence in any manner allowed by the law. Nevertheless if he loses and the court thinks that his defence has been conducted extravagantly and unnecessarily, he then cannot reasonably complain if he is ordered to pay some part of the costs which he caused the prosecution to incur. There is no evidence to suggest that such costs as ordered are not within the appellant`s means: after all, he owns a Mercedes, a flat in Yishun, and a packing business.
 29.At this juncture, it would be appropriate to set out the relevant facts of this case. Both offences were committed by the respondent on the same occasion. The appellant and the respondent were ex lovers. However, the relationship soured when the respondent refused to leave his family for the appellant. In fact, the appellant instituted civil proceedings against him for the alleged breach of promise to marry her. When he learned that she had told members of the community of their relationship, he was angry as the appellant`s actions embarrassed him and his family. Thus, on 31 August 1997, the appellant accused him of verbally abusing her at a Sikh temple by saying in Punjabi `You are a prostitute. I will make you a prostitute. I will make you naked`. He also allegedly intimidated her by raising his arm and moving towards her.
 30.The appellant`s version of the incident was corroborated by a witness, one Sowaran Singh. He had heard the vulgarities uttered by the respondent and had seen him advancing towards the appellant with his hand raised. The appellant also called another witness, one Ranjit Singh, to testify during the trial. He did not witness the alleged incident himself but was called to the temple by a third party after the incident took place. The respondent`s defence to both charges was one of denial. He alleged that the appellant had verbally abused him instead and that Sowaran Singh had ulterior motives in testifying against him as he would allegedly stand a better chance at getting elected into the temple committee. The defence did not call any other witness apart from the accused person himself.
 31.The trial judge applied the test laid down in 
 Oh Cheng Hai 
. While acknowledging that the appellant had a strong case against the respondent, the trial judge was of the opinion that the defence had not been conducted in an extravagant or unnecessary manner. It has to be borne in mind that an appellate court will not readily interfere with the trial judge`s exercise of discretion, unless it can be shown that the judge took into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take into account relevant considerations or was plainly wrong. In this case, the appellant failed to establish this.
 32.In my view, one way of determining whether the defence was conducted `extravagantly and unnecessarily` would be to view the proceedings in the light of the line of defence mounted by the accused person. On the facts of 
 Oh Cheng Hai 
, the costs of prosecution were awarded because the defence was conducted in a manner that did not advance the accused person`s case and was therefore unnecessary. In this case, it could not be said that the respondent had conducted his defence in such a manner as to warrant an order for costs against him. Further, the trial only lasted two days and the record of proceedings did not reveal any prolonged and unnecessary cross-examination by the respondent`s counsel. In my view, there were no compelling reasons to disagree with the trial judge`s exercise of discretion not to award costs.
 33.The appellant contended that the respondent had sufficient means to pay her costs of prosecution. By way of contrast, the appellant herself was currently in some financial difficulties as she had to bear the costs of the private summons. She had to pawn her jewellery to pay the costs of this case. Further, a judgment debt in the sum of $2,550 and costs of $700 remained owing by her to her former solicitors.
 34.In any event, the mere fact that the respondent has the means to pay the costs per se does not mean that the appellant is entitled to such costs. On the other hand, the lack of means of the accused person would be a relevant consideration in determining whether costs should be awarded against him. After all, the court has wide powers under s 403 of the CPC to enforce such an order for costs, including imposing a term of imprisonment on the party in default of such payment.
 35.The appellant argued that, since she had a strong case against the respondent, he ought to have pleaded guilty right from the start. In 
Tan See Wei v Ong Seow Pheng & Anor
 
[1994] AIPR 111
, the magistrate interpreted 
 Oh Cheng Hai 
 and opined that the court was entitled to consider the strength of the case against the accused in determining whether costs ought to be awarded. He said at pp 142-143: 
... in my view, although an accused has a right to claim trial to the charges he faced, that right is not unbridled. No doubt, there must be justice for an accused, but there should also be some justice for the public at large, which is represented at the trial by the public prosecutor. If the public purse had suffered unnecessarily as a result of an accused`s unreasonable decision to claim trial when he was fully aware that the case against him is overwhelming, I do not see why the accused should not be made to pay the full costs of the prosecution, subject to the caveat that all such costs ought to have been reasonably incurred by the prosecution, and the amounts claimed were also reasonable.
 36.He further gave some examples of when a convicted person could be said to have claimed trial unnecessarily at p 143: 
Possibly, such a situation may arise when the prosecution`s evidence included a voluntary confession from the accused, testimony from police officers who have been sworn to uphold the law and independent witnesses, and where the accused was caught red-handed. It is not possible, and probably unwise, to lay down any rigid guidelines
 37.Thus, he reasoned that in cases where the defence was conducted in an extravagant and unnecessary manner, the defence should only be penalised with costs for the parts of the defence that were conducted in such a manner. However, if the accused chose to contest a very strong case, he might end up bearing a reasonable portion of the costs of prosecution which have been reasonably incurred.
 38.In my view, the approach taken by the magistrate was wrong. Although the strength of the case against the accused, his knowledge of this and his conduct of his defence are relevant factors to be considered, it is clear from the dicta in 
 Oh Cheng Hai 
 that, if he should be found to have conducted his defence in an `extravagant or unnecessary` manner, he should only be liable for the part of the costs which he caused the prosecution to incur by reason of such conduct. Thus, he should not be made to bear the costs of prosecution which would have ordinarily been incurred to secure a conviction.
 39.Further, as a matter of policy, an accused person should not be made to bear the costs of prosecution simply because he chooses to claim trial even though the prosecution`s case is strong. The law does not compel an accused person to plead guilty just because he has a weak case. Every accused person has a right to conduct his defence and is entitled to put the prosecution to strict proof of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether an accused person pleads guilty or not would be relevant in determining the appropriate sentence to be meted out by the courts. However, it would not be right to `penalise` the accused person with costs simply because he chooses to claim trial and not plead guilty, even if the case is strong.

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): On 12 February 1999 we ordered that the respondent be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. We now give our reasons for doing so.
 2.The respondent was admitted as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore on 10 October 1984 and was at all material times practising under the name and style of VCS Vardan & Co, a sole proprietorship.
 3.Sometime in or about April 1998, the DPP, Commercial Affairs Department, received information that the respondent had made unauthorised withdrawals of clients` moneys. Upon investigations, it was revealed that from 8 January 1997 to 19 July 1997, the respondent, while practising as an advocate and solicitor at VCS Vardan & Co, had made various unauthorised withdrawals of clients` funds from the clients` account of the law firm, namely, funds maintained in DBS Bank No 007-007342-9.
 4.During that time, the respondent was the authorised signatory of, and was entrusted with dominion over, the funds held in the clients` account. In all, the respondent dishonestly misappropriated a total of S$107,224.05 from the clients` account by making unauthorised withdrawals. The funds withdrawn were used to, inter alia, pay staff salaries and central provident fund contributions, his income tax, office rental and other expenses.
 5.Before commencement of investigations by the Commercial Affairs Department, the respondent had made full restitution of the funds withdrawn from these clients` accounts.
 6.The DPP proceeded with criminal prosecution against the respondent in the subordinate courts, Singapore on one amended charge. The amended charge read as follows: 
You, Venkata Chari Srinivasa Vardan (M/58 years) NRIC No 0381074/G are charged that you, from 8 January 1997 to 19 July 1997, in Singapore, committed the offence of criminal breach of trust in that you, being at the material time a practising Advocate and Solicitor in Singapore and the sole proprietor of the law firm of M/s VCS Vardan & Co (`the said firm`), and entrusted with dominion over clients` funds held in the clients` accounts of the same firm, namely, the funds in DBS Bank Account No 007-007342-9 dishonestly misappropriated a total of $107,224.05 from those funds, comprised in the cheques particularised in the appendix to this charge, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 7.The respondent pleaded guilty to the amended charge on 7 October 1998 before a district judge.
 8.On 23 October 1998, the respondent was convicted and sentenced to six months` imprisonment. The respondent is currently serving sentence in the Queenstown Remand Prison, Singapore.
 9.Subsequently, the Law Society applied by ex parte originating summons under s 94A of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161) for and obtained an order that the respondent be made to show cause pursuant to s 98 why he should not be dealt with under s 83 of the Act.
 10.At the show cause hearing before us, we were informed by counsel for the Law Society that the respondent did not wish to show cause in these proceedings or to contest the same. We were also informed that the respondent was currently serving his sentence and did not wish to attend the hearing.
 11.The show cause proceedings arose pursuant to s 94A read together with s 98 of the Act. Section 94A makes it mandatory for the Law Society to proceed to make an application under s 98 of the Act for the respondent to show cause upon his conviction for an offence involving fraud or dishonesty. The relevant provisions are set out here as follows: 
94A(1) Where an advocate and solicitor has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty, whether the offence was disclosed as a result of an investigation under section 87(3)(b) or otherwise, the Society shall, without further direction or directions, proceed to make an application in accordance with section 98. 
98(1) An application that a solicitor be struck off the roll or suspended from practice or censured or that he be required to answer allegations contained in an affidavit shall be made by originating summons ex parte for an order calling upon the solicitor to show cause.
 12.Sections 83(1) and (2) of the Act state, inter alia: 
(1) All advocates and solicitors shall be subject to the control of the Supreme Court and shall be liable on due cause being shown to be struck off the roll or suspended from practice for any period not exceeding 5 years or censured. 
(2) Such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor - 
(a) has been convicted of a criminal offence, implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession; 
(b) has been guilty of fraudulent or grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty or guilty of such a breach of any usage or rule of conduct made by the Council under the provisions of this Act as amounts to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor 
...
 13.As the respondent had indicated that he did not wish to show cause in these proceedings, the only question that remained was the penalty to be imposed on the respondent. His dishonesty in making unauthorised transactions from his client`s account implied a defect of character which made him unfit for his profession. Moreover, this also amounted to grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty in that misappropriation of clients` moneys was also a breach of the Solicitors` Account Rules 1985.
 14.We noted that there were some mitigating factors here, namely, that the respondent had pleaded guilty in front of the district judge to the charges before him and had made full restitution of all the moneys that he had misappropriated. The respondent was also remorseful. Nevertheless we were of the view that the only suitable penalty was to strike him off the rolls. One had to bear in mind that s 2(1) of the Act expressly provides that no qualified person is to be admitted as an advocate and solicitor unless he is of good character. A conviction under s 406 of the Penal Code carried with it the implication that the respondent was of dishonest character. This would have been sufficient for him not to be admitted as an advocate and solicitor. Further, there was the interest of the legal profession and the public to consider, in that there should be a legal profession observing the highest possible standards of conduct. The respondent had failed to adhere to these standards and had consequently caused harm to the profession as a whole.
 15.We were thus of the view that striking the respondent off the rolls was the only suitable penalty in this case, and we accordingly made the order. We also ordered that the respondent pay the Law Society the costs of these proceedings.",1999-03-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This was an appeal against the decision of a district judge acquitting the respondent of one charge of criminal trespass punishable under s 447 (read with s 441) of the Penal Code (Cap 224). I allowed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 2.
 Background 
 
The prosecution originally prosecuted the appellant on the following charge: 
You, Pardeep Singh s/o Amar Singh, M/34 years old (NRIC S1636059-G) are charged that you on or about 18 August 1998 at or about 4.10am at the fourth level of Oxford Hotel, 218 Queen Street, Singapore, did commit criminal trespass, to wit, by entering into the said hotel in the possession of the Management of Oxford Hotel with intent, thereby causing annoyance to the said management and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 447 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 3.After the close of the case for the defence, the district judge amended the charge to read: 
You, Pardeep Singh s/o Amar Singh, M/34 years old (NRIC S1636059-G) are charged that you on or about 18 August 1998 at or about 4.10am at the fourth level of Oxford Hotel, 218 Queen Street, Singapore, did commit criminal trespass, to wit, by unlawfully remaining in the said hotel in the possession of the Management of Oxford Hotel with intent, thereby to cause annoyance to the said management and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 447 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 Both prosecution and defence counsel had no objection to the amended charge and agreed there was no need to recall any witnesses as proceedings would not have differed substantially, or in any way, from that which had transpired. In his grounds of decision, the district judge pointed out that he should have also amended the place of offence from the `fourth floor` to `ground floor`.
 4.
 The prosecution case 
 
On 18 August 1998 at around 3.45am, the complainant in this case, the duty manager of Oxford Hotel (PW1) was on duty at the main reception desk. He received a call from a hotel guest occupying room 409 (fourth floor, room 9). The guest informed PW1 that there was banging at the door, smashing of glass and demands for payment concerning a girl brought to the hotel for the guest. The guest asked for the police to be called. Instead, PW1 notified his security officer, one Kamis bin Hassan (PW2) and together they proceeded up to the fourth floor to investigate.
 5.At the fourth floor, PW1 saw two men, one Chinese and the other the respondent, standing in front of the door to room 409. The Chinese man was holding a broken bottle; the respondent was empty-handed. Both were making demands for money from the guest within. When PW1 questioned them on what had happened, they both claimed to have introduced a girl to the guest and were demanding money for having made the introduction. PW1 then told them to follow him down to the lobby and they accordingly did so.
 6.Meanwhile, the Chinese man and the respondent continued shouting for the guest to pay them. Thus, they disturbed the hotel`s guests and its management. PW1 told them thrice that if they continued to make so much noise, he would call the police. However, they insisted on collecting the money and stated they would not leave without collecting it. PW1 was concerned for the well-being of the hotel and its guests, thus he called the police. Before the police arrived, PW1 saw the Chinese man give a shout, then walk out of the hotel. Only the respondent remained. When the police arrived, they questioned the respondent and went up to the fourth floor to investigate and question the guest. Subsequently, the respondent was arrested and PW1 was informed that the respondent might be charged for criminal trespass.
 7.The prosecution case relied mainly on PW1`s testimony to the effect that the respondent had been asked to leave the hotel but had refused. The prosecution thus submitted that, by such refusal despite having been asked to leave, the respondent had unlawfully remained at the hotel and that an intention to annoy the hotel management could be inferred from the surrounding circumstances.
 8.PW2`s evidence was adduced mainly to corroborate PW1`s. He was at the hotel`s fire command centre at 3.50am when PW1 came by to alert him of trouble on the fourth floor. He then accompanied PW1 to the fourth floor where he saw the two men at the lift lobby and the Chinese man holding a broken bottle. He heard PW1 question them and their reply. He observed there was scattered glass on the floor and in front of the door to room 409. Later at the lobby, when the Chinese man and the respondent refused to leave and continued making noise and demanding payment, PW1 called the police. PW2 heard the Chinese man tell the respondent he wanted to go up. Then he saw the Chinese man walking to the lift lobby and subsequently disappear. When the police arrived, he brought one officer to search for the Chinese man within the hotel but they failed to find him.
 9.
 Close of the prosecution case 
 
After the prosecution closed its case, counsel for the defence submitted that there was no case to answer. He pointed out that the respondent merely accompanied the Chinese man to the hotel. Thus, the respondent was but a passive bystander, it being the Chinese man who held the broken bottle and was observed to have knocked on the door to room 409. The respondent in fact complied with PW1`s order to sit down in the hotel lobby to await the police`s arrival.
 10.Counsel also referred to the first information report (FIR) recorded from PW1`s telephone call to the police. The FIR stated that there were three men fighting and throwing bottles, and one of them was the hotel`s guest. Such a scene was never observed by either PW1 or PW2. Counsel thus submitted that PW1`s evidence was not credible. Counsel also pointed out that there was no notice at the hotel disallowing the respondent`s entry within.
 11.The trial judge found that the prosecution had made out a case for the defence to answer, applying the principles in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 [1980-1981] SLR 73 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 . He thus called for the defence.
 12.
 The case for the defence 
 
The respondent elected to give evidence. The Chinese man was a casual friend introduced by other friends not long ago and going by the name `Ricky`. On 17 August 1998, he ran into Ricky while having a drink at an Orchard Road club around 11pm. After leaving the club, they met two Caucasian men who were interested in getting to know women. Ricky agreed to arrange for two women to be brought to the hotel and left the respondent with the two Caucasians for a while. He returned with two women. The two Caucasians invited Ricky and the respondent back to the hotel for drinks, which invitation was taken up.
 13.They all arrived at the hotel around 11.45pm and proceeded up to room 409, where they drank together until the respondent left the hotel with Ricky at around 12.30am on 18 August 1998. Ricky then informed the respondent he had to return to the hotel to collect money. The respondent subsequently accompanied him back to do so, at around 3.30am. On Ricky`s instructions, the respondent sat in the lobby while Ricky went upstairs. After five to ten minutes, Ricky returned. He told the respondent there was some trouble upstairs and one of the Caucasians had threatened him with a knife. In turn, the respondent conveyed this to PW1 who was at the reception desk and asked him to seek the aid of the police.
 14.The respondent then turned his attention to Ricky to discuss the problem. He denied that he shouted, neither did PW1 demand that he and Ricky leave. In fact, PW1 asked them to sit down until the police arrived. The respondent therefore sat down but Ricky said he wanted to go up again. The respondent told Ricky not to trouble the Caucasians any more and let the police deal with the matter. Ricky however proceeded towards the lift and then disappeared.
 15.When the police arrived, they questioned the respondent who maintained that he had done nothing wrong. Later, however, they arrested him.
 16.The defence called as its witnesses the investigating officer and a few of the police officers who were members of the arresting party. The investigating officer confirmed that he recorded a s 122(6) statement from the respondent in which the respondent denied the charge. One of the officers who placed the respondent under arrest, Inspector Tan Kim Teck (DW3), gave evidence that he was asked to go to the hotel because there was a misunderstanding between a hotel guest and some outsiders. Upon arriving there, he was informed that police officers who arrived earlier had conducted a search for a male Chinese since there were supposed to have been two outsiders but only the respondent was present. DW3 stated he was not told that the Chinese man had been told to leave and had accordingly left. He then went up to room 409 to speak to the guest but added that no one had asked the guest whether the respondent had been outside his door, nor was the guest asked to identify the respondent. He confirmed that there were some glass fragments outside room 409. The final defence witness, Cpl Azam (DW4), agreed there were glass pieces on the fourth floor and that the respondent was never identified by any hotel guest.
 17.The defence was to the effect that the respondent did not commit any trespass. He was not denied entry into the hotel at any point, nor had he been told to leave it when he returned the second time. His intent and purpose were merely to accompany Ricky, who had felt that the two Caucasians staying at the hotel owed him money for services rendered. It was never the respondent`s intention to cause trouble or annoy the hotel management and its guests in any way.
 18.
 The decision below 
 
The district judge held that, for there to be any offence of criminal trespass, based on the case presented by the prosecution, it could only have happened when the accused insisted on remaining in the hotel when allegedly told by the hotel management to leave. Such refusal to leave must also have been accompanied by an intention to cause annoyance to the management. He thus amended the charge to be that of unlawfully remaining on property with intent ([para ] 3, above), but omitted to amend the place of offence from the `fourth floor` to `ground floor`.
 19.He stated that for a charge of criminal trespass by unlawfully remaining on premises with intent, there were three essential ingredients the prosecution must prove: (1). the respondent entered into or upon property in another`s possession;
 (2). he unlawfully remained on such property; and
 (3). his unlawful remaining at the property was with the intention of annoying the person in possession of the property.
 20.On the facts, the judge found the first ingredient satisfied but not the second or the third. He made a finding of fact that PW1 never ordered the respondent to leave the hotel.
 21.On the element of intention, the judge noted that the prosecution admitted that the respondent had expressed his intention to remain at the hotel if Ricky did not get the money. This being the expressed intention, the judge found that, on the law, he did not need to go further to see if any requisite intention may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances. Thus, he held that the respondent did not unlawfully remain at the hotel and, while he did remain, did not possess the requisite intention to annoy the hotel management. The respondent was therefore acquitted.
 22.
 The issues on appeal 
 
The prosecution appealed against the trial judge`s decision on two main grounds. First, it was submitted that he had erred in law when he held that the prosecution had to prove the respondent`s intention to annoy the hotel management when he remained on the hotel premises. The case of 
PP v Seah Soon Keong
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 442
  clearly stated that intention to annoy may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances of the case and need not be the primary or proximate intent. Therefore the judge was wrong to say the prosecution had to prove intention. He was also wrong in declining to infer from the facts the requisite intention to annoy.
 23.Next, it was submitted that the trial judge should have preferred the evidence of PW1 and PW2 over that of the defence witnesses. Thus, the trial judge should have found that PW1 had told the respondent to leave the hotel.
 24.
 Criminal trespass 
 
The definition of criminal trespass is found in s 447 of the Penal Code: 
Whoever enters into or upon property in the possession of another with intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to commit an offence, is said to commit `criminal trespass`.
 Criminal trespass is punishable with either imprisonment up to three months or a maximum fine of $500 or both: s 447.
 25.Section 441 envisages two types of criminal trespass. The first occurs when the accused enters on another person`s property, with the intention to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of the property or commit an offence. The second type occurs when the accused`s presence on the property, initially lawful, becomes unlawful and the accused remains on the property with a similar intention.
 26.The trial judge observed that the prosecution`s only witnesses were PW1 and PW2. PW1`s evidence focussed on how he had told the respondent and Ricky, who were allegedly making a lot of noise, to leave the hotel three times. It was when they refused to leave that PW1 contacted the police as a last resort to get rid of them. He found that the prosecution`s case thus proceeded on the basis that the hotel management was called by a hotel guest to deal with the respondent who was supposedly causing annoyance to the guest and who continued to cause annoyance to the hotel management. The evidence led in this respect came from PW1 and PW2, both ostensibly representing the hotel management. The guest, who was one of the two male Caucasians allegedly befriended by the respondent and his friend Ricky, has since left Singapore and was not one of the prosecution`s witnesses. Without the guest`s evidence pertaining to the incident on the fourth floor, the trial judge held that the offence would only be made out upon the intervention of PW1, occurring primarily at the ground floor hotel lobby where the respondent was allegedly told to leave.
 27.In my opinion, there was no need to amend the charge. The fact that the guest was not called as a prosecution witness did not reduce the weight of certain incontrovertible facts. There was broken glass on the fourth floor. At least Ricky was on the fourth floor to demand money from the guest. The respondent accompanied Ricky to the hotel for this purpose. Based on these unchallenged facts, it would be sufficient for the prosecution to proceed on the original charge without amendment.
 28.The offence of criminal trespass of the first type under s 441 requires the accused to have entered on property belonging to another with intention. Here, there was no dispute that the hotel belonged to the hotel management, represented by PW1 and PW2, and the respondent had entered upon the hotel at around 3.30am. The main issue arising in this case was whether the respondent so entered the hotel with the requisite intention.
 29.On the issue of intention, the trial judge first stated that the prosecution bore the burden of proving intention. The respondent had expressly announced his intention to collect payment, otherwise he would not leave. The prosecution did not dispute this. The trial judge cited Seah Soon Keong for the holding that `proving intent to annoy under s 441 of the Penal Code is usually a matter of inference with such inference to be drawn from the surrounding circumstances`. The judge stated that, if he had to draw an inference, the only intention he could infer from all the evidence, including the prosecution`s, went against the prosecution`s case. This inference was that the respondent genuinely believed he could remain at the hotel until the receipt of money. The judge however found no need to draw any inferences as, on the evidence, the respondent had a sole intention which was made known to PW1.
 30.The prosecution alleged the district judge erred in law by misapplying Seah Soon Keong. That case allowed an inference to be made of the requisite intention under s 441 which need not be the primary or proximate intent. The prosecution conceded that the primary intent of the respondent was to collect payment from the hotel guest. This however did not mean that an intention to annoy cannot be inferred from the surrounding facts, wherein the respondent had shouted and refused to leave the hotel despite being urged by PW1 thrice to do so. It was further submitted that, even if the judge found PW1 had not asked the respondent to leave the hotel, so long as it was shown from the surrounding circumstances that the respondent had shouted and created trouble at the hotel at the material time, it was sufficient to infer the requisite intention to annoy.
 31.Two cases were cited by the trial judge in his grounds to support his decision: 
T Ponnamalam & Ors v PP
 
[1948] MLJ 76
 and 
Ahmad bin Ali v PP
 
 
[1967] 1 MLJ 211
 .
 32.In 
 T Ponnamalam 
, the appellants threatened to go on strike. The complainant was the appellants` employer who notified them by letter that, unless they resumed work within 24 hours of receipt of the letter, their employment would be terminated with immediate effect and they would have to leave the working premises within 24 hours. In doing so, the complainant was validly exercising his rights although the appellants did not realise this and refused to heed the letter.
 33.At the appellate stage, the court allowed the appeal. Even though the evidence clearly showed that the complainant was annoyed, the court found that the appellants who remained on the working premises under the mistake that they could not be dismissed whilst on strike, did not have the requisite intent to annoy.
 34.In 
 Ahmad bin Ali 
, the appellant was convicted but he appealed only on sentence. The appellate court reversed conviction of its own accord because it found that the dominant intention of the appellant was to induce a girl out from the premises he had entered to have a tete-a-tete with him. The court also referred to the case of 
Abbass v Tomby
 
[1881] 3 Ky 131
.
 35.In 
Ker Ban Siong
 [1992] 2 SLR 939 at p 941, I considered 
 Abbass v Tomby 
 and declined to follow the case for its legal principle, in that the offence of criminal trespass was restricted to situations where the primary or proximate intent was to cause insult or annoyance, as such restriction would run foul of the definition of criminal trespass in s 441. Section 441 merely required the entry to have been made `with intent ... to annoy`, the requisite intent usually inferred from the surrounding circumstances. There was nothing which required the requisite intention to be the sole or dominant one.
 36.In my view, the two cases cited by the trial judge followed the restriction in 
 Abbass v Tomby 
 which limited the offence of criminal trespass to situations where the primary intent was to cause annoyance or insult. This restriction was found to be erroneous in 
 Ker Ban Siong 
 simply because it would go against the express wording in s 441. Accordingly, the two cases did not in any way support the trial judge`s finding and he should not have relied on them as stating the present law.
 37.The law on how the requisite intention under s 441 may be proved has been clearly stated in 
 Seah Soon Keong 
 at p 444: 
In 
 PP v Ker Ban Siong
, I held that the requisite intent to annoy under s 441 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) must usually be inferred from surrounding circumstances of the alleged offence and need not be the accused`s primary or proximate intent. I would reiterate that now, because it would seem that there continues to be a tendency in some quarters to insist dogmatically that even though there exist circumstances from which the requisite intent can be satisfactorily inferred, nevertheless the prosecution must adduce more evidence to prove such intent.
 
Proving criminal intent can never be an easy thing, since people who harbour criminal intentions are hardly likely to publicize these intentions. 
 The court will not lightly attribute criminal intent to an accused person, but when such intent may clearly be inferred from the surrounding circumstances of the alleged offence, there is no reason why the prosecution should be required to produce further evidence
. Take, for example, an accused who was banned from a club by its management and who persisted in entering the club in knowing violation of the ban. The circumstances of his entry are such that one can infer an intent to annoy the management who banned him. It is difficult to imagine what further evidence the prosecution might be called on to produce in such a situation. [Emphasis is mine.]
 38.The law on this point is therefore succinct. The prosecution of course bears the burden of proving all the elements of the offence. For the offence of criminal trespass defined in s 441, an essential element to be proved is that of the requisite intention. This need not be the primary intention of the accused; he may have the requisite intention with a primary intention. This requisite intention may be clearly inferred from the surrounding circumstances, though it will not be lightly inferred. When the court does infer such intention, there is no need for the prosecution to adduce further evidence to prove intention. To this extent, the trial judge was also wrong to find that, as there was an express intention not being the requisite intention, he need not go further to see whether the requisite intention may be inferred from the circumstances. It was therefore open to me to see whether such intention might be inferred.
 39.To begin, it would be helpful to illustrate with case authorities how a court goes about inferring intent to annoy from surrounding circumstances. In 
 Seah Soon Keong 
, the accused was found in the complainant`s hostel room at an unusual time for visiting, 2.45am. He did not know whose room he was in. He did not know the complainant or the friend Michele he purported to be looking for at the material time. When he realised the complainant was leading him to meet her friends, he fled without another word. In these circumstances, I found ample evidence from which it could clearly be inferred that the accused had entered the complainant`s hostel room with intent to annoy her.
 40.Another case wherein I inferred the requisite intent to annoy under s 441 on the first type of criminal trespass was 
 Ker Ban Siong 
. On 22 April 1998, the accused was arrested by the police at the Bukit Turf Club. The management took up the police`s recommendation to ban the accused from entering the club. A prohibition notice was served on the accused under the club`s constitution, forbidding him from entering the club for a year. There was no doubt that the accused could and had read the notice. The notice also warned the accused that he might be prosecuted for criminal trespass should he disregard the prohibition. Four months later, he was again arrested in the club. This time, he was prosecuted for criminal trespass under s 441 read with s 447 of the Penal Code.
 41.At the trial, the accused was called on for his defence. He elected to remain silent but was eventually acquitted. On the prosecution`s appeal, the accused stated that he had entered the club with the intention of watching the races. As this statement was not made under oath, it thus could not be accepted as evidence. The accused`s silence at trial would have allowed the trial judge to draw an adverse inference against him under s 196(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). Further, a glaring fact was that the accused had been expressly and clearly warned of the undesirability of his presence on the premises but he had chosen to ignore the warning. Such conduct required an explanation, yet none was forthcoming. Under such circumstances, the requisite intent to annoy the club management by his entry on the club premises could be clearly inferred.
 42.Counsel for the respondent referred me to the case of 
Ong Eng Guan v PP
 
[1956] MLJ 44
 . The appellant there was an employee of a sewing machine company. The complainant purchased a sewing machine from the company on hire purchase. He defaulted in paying some instalments and the appellant was sent to his premises to either collect payment or exercise the company`s legal right to repossess the machine. At the complainant`s premises, the parties attempted to negotiate for payment but were unsuccessful. The appellant then proceeded to drag away the machine and took it from the complainant.
 43.The magistrate convicted the appellant of house trespass with intent to annoy the complainant. The appellate court overturned the conviction on the element of intention. It was pointed out that while the complainant was undoubtedly annoyed by the appellant, the offence required the appellant to have entered upon the premises with intent to annoy. The evidence only showed parties having a mutual discussion in an attempt to resolve the matter to no avail. There was no evidence to show, or from which to infer that the appellant ever had an intention to annoy.
 44.I could not see how 
 Ong Eng Guan 
 would assist the respondent in any way. Here, the events unfolded in this manner. From the respondent`s own evidence, he and Ricky met the guest and another Caucasian at Orchard Road earlier on, shortly before midnight. After Ricky procured two girls for the guest and his friend, Ricky and the respondent were invited back to the hotel for drinks. The respondent stated that he never heard anything about money being mentioned at anytime. After drinking with the two Caucasians, Ricky and the respondent left the hotel around 12.30am. Then Ricky suddenly wanted to return to the hotel to collect some money. He decided to follow Ricky back to the hotel. Both of them returned to the hotel around 3.30am, three hours after they had left it.
 45.It was around here that the evidence started going in two different directions. The respondent claimed that he remained downstairs whilst Ricky went up to the fourth floor to collect the money. The prosecution witnesses said otherwise; they saw him on the fourth floor with Ricky who was holding a broken bottle. In my opinion, it was irrelevant where the respondent was. Section 441 only required him to have entered the hotel, which he clearly had. The important question was his intention when he entered the hotel.
 46.The respondent stated and the prosecution conceded that the respondent`s express intention was to collect money for Ricky. This was clearly revealed in the undisputed evidence that the respondent had declared he would not leave the hotel until Ricky got the money. Seah Soon Keong states that having a dominant or an express intention does not preclude the court from proceeding further to infer from the facts the requisite intention, provided the facts so allow.
 47.The undisputed facts here revealed that the respondent left the hotel with Ricky after having drinks with the guest and another Caucasian and, presumably, with the two women Ricky introduced to the guest, in room 409. They must have left the hotel in good spirits, or at least departed on amicable terms with the guest. Yet Ricky and the respondent decided shortly after that that they would return to the hotel to demand money from the guest. It must have been to `demand` and not otherwise to collect a legitimate or even privately agreed debt, as through his own admission, the respondent confirmed that, during the previous exchange amongst himself, Ricky and the guest, there had been no mention of the guest paying Ricky for having introduced girls to him.
 48.Three hours later, both of them arrived back at the hotel to put into action their plan to demand money from the guest. Nothing was said of what they did after leaving the hotel and before returning to it. It was peculiar that no explanation was forthcoming of what happened during those three hours. It was clear that something must have been afoot as they suddenly decided to return to the hotel to demand money from the guest. And demand money from the guest they did, there being incontrovertible evidence of broken glass found at the fourth floor, which must have been a consequence of the respondent and Ricky`s plan to demand money. I had no doubt that, whether the respondent remained downstairs or followed Ricky to the fourth floor, he knew of the plan to demand money of the guest. This was fortified when one considered the respondent`s own declaration to remain at the hotel until he got money. Added to this was the fact that this incident happened around 4am in the morning. I seriously questioned the intention of a person who enters into the residence of another to demand money at 4am. If this did not reveal a clear intention to annoy, I could not see what else would.
 49.The prosecution witnesses stated that the respondent and Ricky were making a lot of noise whilst demanding payment. This coupled with the respondent`s express declaration that he would not leave until he got the money further supported the compelling inference that the respondent entered the hotel with intention to annoy the occupants within.
 50.Counsel for the respondent submitted that, by remaining at the hotel to await the arrival of the police, the respondent showed that he had no guilty intention; he firmly believed the police would come to `resolve the matter`. What happened went something like this. The respondent was seen talking to Ricky. The respondent said Ricky had told him he was going back to the fourth floor to speak to the guest. The respondent on his part tried to dissuade Ricky and told him to wait until the police arrived. Ricky refused and walked towards the lift lobby. He then disappeared. A search for him by the police revealed that he had left the hotel. PW1 stated he saw Ricky leave the hotel via the front door. I had little doubt that the respondent had been deliberately misled by Ricky into thinking that the latter would still remain to wait for the police, when he in fact took to his heels leaving the respondent alone to `face the music`, to put it figuratively. I did not see how the fact that the respondent was quietly waiting for the police could rebut the clear inference that he entered the hotel with intention at least to annoy the occupants.
 51.One more point deserves clarification. The district judge appeared to have relied heavily on the contents of the FIR made by PW1 in his decision to acquit the respondent. He found it `strange` that the FIR instead of referring to the respondent`s refusal to leave the hotel despite having been ordered to do so, disclosed a scenario of fighting with involvement of broken glass. It was for this reason he believed the respondent when the latter claimed he was never told to leave the hotel.
 52.The prosecution argued that the trial judge had no reason to prefer the respondent`s evidence over that of PW1. It was pointed out that PW1 had no motive to lie about having asked the respondent to leave three times. While it was conceded that the FIR was silent on this point, it was argued that it was perfectly logical for the broken bottle and commotion earlier on to have been the more important information to convey to the police. The trial judge was wrong to have relied mainly on the FIR`s omission to mention the fact that PW1 had told the respondent to leave: see 
Tan Pin Seng v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 418
 . Further, PW2`s evidence generally corroborated PW1`s.
 53.In 
 Tan Pin Seng 
, I said at p 428: 
It is a misconception to regard the first information report or police report as a document which should contain the entire case for the prosecution. Its main purpose is merely to give information of a cognizable offence to the police so as to set them in motion. The form of the police report merely requires an informant to provide `brief details including date, time and place at which the offence occurred`. The form itself clearly does not contemplate that the informant or complainant should give elaborate details of the alleged offence. The fact that such details are not mentioned in the report is therefore irrelevant. If, however, there are material discrepancies between the report and the informant`s or complainant`s testimony in court, the report will then be relevant to impeach the credibility of the witness as a previous inconsistent statement.
 54.Here, the fact that the FIR did not mention that the respondent and Ricky had been told to leave but had refused to did not naturally mean that they had not been told to leave. The main purpose of the FIR was to inform the police of a possible offence having been committed and to get them down to investigate at the scene. PW1 had only just seen the shattered glass pieces on the fourth floor. From his point of view, there must have been some form of a fight to warrant shattering of glass. At least the guest, the respondent and Ricky must have been involved in such a fight. It was with this thought that PW1 made the FIR. That did not mean PW1 had not gone on to order Ricky and the respondent off the hotel. The trial judge had not impeached the credibility of any witnesses nor found any material discrepancies in PW1`s evidence and thus, the provision in Tan Pin Seng did not apply. He therefore should not have read too much into the fact that the FIR did not mention PW1 having ordered the respondent (and Ricky) off the hotel.
 55.In light of all the above, I convicted the respondent of one count of criminal trespass under the original charge.
 56.
 Sentence 
 
The DPP drew my attention to the respondent`s lengthy history of antecedents. He had been sentenced to four months` imprisonment for voluntarily causing hurt and four weeks` imprisonment for theft in dwelling. He had a long string of drug related convictions which warranted supervision and had been detained in drug rehabilitation centres for six months each on four different occasions. He had been fined $2,000 on three separate occasions for failure to report for urine tests and another $800 for theft.
 57.It was evident that the respondent was no babe out of the woods. I therefore sentenced him to serve the maximum penalty under s 447 which sets out the sentence for criminal trespass under s 441. The respondent would serve three months` imprisonment and pay a $500 fine in default of which he would serve an additional one month`s imprisonment.",1999-04-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
LP THEAN JA
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This appeal arose from an action instituted by the first respondents, the Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1075 (`MCST`), against the appellants, RSP Architects Planners & Engineers (Raglan Squire & Partners FE) (`RSP`), claiming damages for negligence in the design and supervision of the construction of a condominium called Eastern Lagoon II situate at East Coast Road. RSP while denying liability took out third party proceedings against the second respondents, Engineering Construction (Pte) Ltd (`EC`), who were the main contractors of the condominium, claiming against them an indemnity or contribution. The action was heard before Judith Prakash J. She allowed the claim of MCST against RSP and dismissed RSP`s claim against EC. Against her decision RSP appealed. We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
 2.
 Facts 
 
The Eastern Lagoon II and another condominium called Eastern Lagoon I, are two separate developments forming the Eastern Lagoon condominium which was developed by the developers, Eastern Lagoon Pte Ltd. The developers appointed RSP as the architects and engineers and EC as the main contractors for the development.
 3.The Eastern Lagoon II condominium comprises two separate 19-storey apartment blocks, the Virgo and Gemini blocks. Flanking each side of the Virgo block is a three-storey block of walk-up apartments, maisonettes and townhouses, known as the Taurus and Capricorn blocks. Similarly the Gemini block is flanked on either side by three-storey blocks, named Libra and Aquarius. Design of the project commenced in 1973 and was completed in 1981. Following the grant of written permission by the Development Control Division of Public Works Department (`PWD`), construction commenced in July 1982 and was completed in September 1984. The certificate of fitness for occupation was granted on 20 July 1985. MCST, the management corporation of the condominium, was constituted on 5 April 1986.
 4.Some six years later, on 20 November 1992, bricks and brick tiles forming part of a gable end wall of the Gemini block fell onto unit [num ]03-01 of the Libra block causing damage to the roof and contents of that unit. Shortly thereafter, MCST appointed M/s Murray North (SEA) Pte Ltd (`Murray North`), who are the structural engineers and chartered building surveyors, to investigate and report on the damage and potential dangers arising from this incident.
 5.In May 1993, PWD having been informed of the failure of the wall claddings considered that the condition of the external walls of the two tower blocks was likely to be dangerous and issued an order dated 29 May 1993 requiring MCST, among other things, to appoint a professional engineer to inspect the condition of the walls and execute such rectification works as were necessary.
 6.
 The walls 
 
The external walls of the high-rise blocks were constructed as follows. The skeleton of each high-rise block consisted of horizontal concrete slabs, demarcating each storey of the block. The slabs were supported by concrete pillars. Together, the vertical columns and horizontal beams constituted a reinforced concrete frame. The spaces between the columns and beams were then filled up with panels of brickwork to form what are known as `gable end walls`. Originally the brickwork panelling was designed as solid walls, but subsequently owing to a design change, the brickwork was designed as a cavity wall which was made up of an inner and an outer layers (or `leaves`) of brickwork with a cavity being present in between the two layers. To achieve a uniform external appearance, the faces of the vertical columns and horizontal beams of the reinforced concrete frame were covered with brick tiles. These brick tiles were laid over and affixed to the concrete slabs and pillars with a sand and mortar paste. In order for the external bricks to be made flush with the brick tiles, it was necessary to lay the bricks with some `overhang`, ie the laid bricks jutted out over the precipice of the concrete slab to the measurement of the thickness of the brick tiles. For our purpose, the bricks and brick tiles of the external walls are referred to as `wall claddings`.
 7.The external walls and brick tiles are common property over which MCST has the management and control. The wall claddings failed at only one location, namely, the fifth storey of one of the gable end walls of Gemini block. MCST, however, carried out rectification works to all gable end walls of both the tower blocks. They also repaired the roof of unit [num ]03-01 of Libra block and made good the damage there. The bulk of their claim was for the costs and expenses incurred in carrying out the rectification works. It was their case that although there was only one incident of falling tiles and bricks, the wall claddings had failed throughout the gable end walls and had to be repaired before any further injury or damage occurred. They asserted that the main cause of the failure was the absence of movement joints in the structure of the walls and that the failure was contributed to by the inadequacy of wall ties, the inadequate roughening of the concrete surfaces and the inadequate support of brickwork, and that these inadequacies were caused by the negligence of RSP in the design and supervision of the construction of the walls.
 8.In their defence, RSP asserted that they owed no duty of care to MCST in respect of either the design or the supervision. This was because the damage sustained by MCST by reason of the failure of the claddings was purely economic loss, and RSP did not stand in such a relationship of proximity to MCST that they could be made responsible for pure economic loss. RSP`s alternative stand was that the failure of the claddings was due to bad workmanship on the part of EC, the main contractors, and that as they had supervised the works adequately they could not be made responsible for sheer bad workmanship. They said that the absence of movement joints in the claddings had nothing to do with the failure and, in any event, they were not negligent in failing to provide for such joints in the design as they had acted in accordance with local architectural practice at the time of construction in deciding that movement joints were not necessary for the tower blocks of the condominium.
 9.RSP`s claim against the third party was based on their allegation that the failure of the claddings was caused or contributed to by bad workmanship for which EC were responsible. Accordingly, EC were liable to indemnify RSP against their liability, if any, to MCST. EC`s stand was that the failure was due to the absence of movement joints and not to any lapse in their workmanship and, in any event, the tiling works were carried out by independent sub-contractors for whom they have no responsibility in tort.
 10.Judith Prakash J allowed the MCST`s claim against RSP and dismissed RSP`s claim against EC. First, she held that the architects owed a duty of care to the MCST to avoid the loss sustained. Secondly, she found as a fact that the architects` design had fallen short of the requisite standard of care. Thirdly, she exonerated EC from liability, holding firstly that the architects` design was so flawed that the quality of the construction was irrelevant, and secondly, that EC having delegated the task of constructing the walls to independent contractors could not be held liable for any failure or bad workmanship in such construction.
 11.
 The appeal 
 
Before us, the learned trial judge`s decision was challenged on three main grounds. First, RSP, as architects, owed no duty of care to the MCST in respect of the design of the condominium insofar as purely economic loss was concerned. Secondly, it was contended that even if they owed a duty of care to the MCST, they had met the standard of care demanded of them. In other words, they claimed that their design was sound and that their supervision of the construction was adequate. Thirdly, the appellants contested the learned trial judge`s determination that no order for an indemnity or contribution should be made against EC, the third party.
 12.
 Duty of care 
 
Although the falling bricks and brick tiles caused physical damage to the roof and contents of the unit [num ]03-01 of the Libra block, which MCST had made good, the main expenses incurred by them were in respect of rectification of the wall claddings, which had not fallen, so as to avoid any future injury to persons and/or damage to property. These were the expenses which MCST sought to recover from RSP and they were not loss sustained in consequence of injury to person or damage to property. They were pure economic loss. The first issue in this appeal was one of law, and that was whether RSP owed a duty of care to MCST to guard against such economic loss.
 13.The question whether a duty of care is owed by the developers of a condominium (as contradistinct from the architects) to the management corporation of the condominium was considered by this court at length and was decided in the affirmative in 
RSP Architects Planners & Engineers v Ocean Front Pte Ltd
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 113
 . In the instant case, the learned trial judge applied a similar line of reasoning in 
 Ocean Front 
 in analysing the relationship between the architects, RSP and the management corporation, MCST, and held that the architects owed a duty of care to MCST to avoid the loss sustained. She reasoned thus at [para ] 14-15: 
14 I have, therefore, as a first step, to consider the relationship between the defendants [RSP] as architects for the condominium and the plaintiffs [MCST] who as its management corporation are statutorily entrusted with the maintenance, upkeep and repair of its common property. Although the two situations are obviously not identical, many of the factors which the Court of Appeal found established a very close relationship between the developers and the management corporation in 
 Ocean Front 
 also exist in this case. 
15 The factual situation is as follows. The decision to construct a condominium was made by the developers. They, however, brought the defendants into the project at a very early stage and it was the defendants who bore the responsibility for the design of the condominium and who also undertook to supervise its construction in accordance with the general responsibilities of architects in Singapore. It was the defendants who decided what the tower blocks should look like and chose the type of wall cladding to be used for its external walls. They undertook the obligation to design the condominium so as to ensure that it was a safe structure and were alone responsible for the design. They were involved in the project almost every step of the way up to completion of construction and issue of the certificate of fitness for occupation. They would have been aware that the developers had decided to apply for subdivision of the condominium and that accordingly each lot in the subdivided building would have a separate subsidiary strata certificate of title. They would have been aware also that the consequence of this decision was that in due course a management corporation would be formed comprising the various subsidiary strata title proprietors and that this management corporation would succeed the developers as the person responsible for the control, management and administration of the common property and having the obligations of up-keeping and maintaining the common property. The performance of the aforesaid obligations would be affected by whether there had been reasonable care in the design and supervision of the project. The defendants knew or ought to have known that if they were negligent in their design and/or supervision the resulting defects would have to be made good by the management corporation. I would add that it was obviously foreseeable by the defendants that if they were negligent in the design of the condominium, this could result in expensive rectification work and therefore economic loss for either or both the subsidiary proprietors and the management corporation.
 She then concluded at [para ] 16: 
16 I consider that the factors which I have enumerated above do result in a sufficient proximity in the relationship between the defendants as architects of a condominium and the plaintiffs as the management corporation of that condominium so as to give rise to a duty on the part of the defendants to the plaintiffs to exercise reasonable care in the design and supervision of the construction of the common property so as to guard against the plaintiffs sustaining the damage complained of in this case, ie rectification of defects caused by negligent design and/or supervision. Although the relationship is not as close as that of the developers and the management corporation, it is sufficiently close in my judgment for the requirements of proximity to be satisfied and the duty of care to be imposed.
 14.Having found that there was sufficient proximity in the relationship between MCST and RSP and following the approach adopted by this Court in 
 Ocean Front 
, she went on to consider whether there was any good reason of public policy to avoid the imposition of such a duty on the architect and came to the conclusion that there was none. She said at [para ] 17: 
[T]he amount recoverable is determinate, the class of persons is definable and the time span is not indeterminate because of the provisions of the Limitation Act (Cap 163). As for the second question relating to the objection that recovery for economic loss would result in an indefinitely transmissible warranty, this is not applicable since, under the scheme of the relevant legislation, until termination of the strata subdivision plan, the management corporation will always be the person having responsibility for the common property.
 15.
 RSP`s contention on the duty of care 
 
RSP put at the forefront of their case the contention that 
 Ocean Front 
 was wrongly decided and should now be overruled. In support, their counsel advanced three arguments. His first argument was that this court in arriving at that decision was wrong in following the decision of the House of Lords in 
Junior Books Ltd v Veitchi Ltd
 
[1983] AC 520
 and rejecting the test laid down by the subsequent decision of the House of Lords in 
Murphy v Brentwood District Council
 
[1990] 1 AC 398
. Secondly, counsel argued that this court wrongly applied 
 Junior Books 
 in that the `crucial element of reliance` which was present in that case was absent in 
 Ocean Front 
. The third argument was that even if 
 Ocean Front 
 was correctly decided, it should be read in conjunction with 
Caparo Industries plc v Dickman & Ors
 
[1990] 2 AC 605
 and in consequence should not be applied in a situation such as the present one which involved a relationship between the management corporation of the condominium and the architects who were engaged by the developers in the construction of the condominium.
 16.
 Two-stage test 
 
Counsel`s first argument was twofold. First, 
 Junior Books 
, though not expressly overruled by the House of Lords in their subsequent decision in 
D & F Estates Ltd v Church Commissioners for England
 
[1989] 1 AC 177
, was `obviously no longer good law`. This court in following 
 Junior Books 
, in effect, adopted the two-stage test enunciated by Lord Wilberforce in 
Anns & Ors v Merton London Borough Council
 
[1978] AC 728
 which was rejected by the High Court of Australia in 
The Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman & Anor
 
[1984-85] 
157 CLR 424
 and was overruled by the House of Lords in 
Murphy v Brentwood District Council
 
[1991] 1 AC 398
. Secondly, this court referred extensively to Australian and New Zealand cases, and relied in particular on the Australian High Court`s decision in 
Bryan v Maloney
 
[1995] 128 ALR 163
 which, though it did not reject, was certainly non-committal with reference to, the two-stage test as laid down in 
 Anns 
. By implication, it was suggested that the approach adopted in 
 Ocean Front 
 (being based on 
 Junior Books 
) was inconsistent with the reasoning in 
 Bryan v Maloney 
. Thus, 
 Ocean Front 
 was wrongly decided and should now be overruled.
 17.In order to deal with this argument in full and in the proper perspective it is necessary to traverse again some of the grounds which were considered and dealt with in 
 Ocean Front 
. We examine first what precisely was said by Lord Wilberforce in laying down the two-stage test in 
 Anns 
, and secondly whether the test was applied in 
 Ocean Front 
. The facts in that case have been sufficiently stated in 
 Ocean Front 
 and it is unnecessary to repeat them. Suffice here to set out what Lord Wilberforce said with reference to the two-stage test at pp 751-752: 
Through the trilogy of cases in this House - 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 562
, 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465
 and 
Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office
 
[1970] AC 1004
, the position has now been reached that 
 in order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular situation
, it is not necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which a duty of care has been held to exist. Rather 
 the question has to be approached in two stages
. First one has to ask whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suffered damage there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neighbourhood such that, 
 in the reasonable contemplation of the former, carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter
 - in which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly, if the first question is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there are any considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of person to whom it is owed or the damages to which a breach of it may arise ... [Emphasis is added.]
 18.It seems to us that what is objectionable in that passage is firstly his Lordship`s sweeping proposition of a single general rule or principle which can be applied in every situation to determine whether a duty of care arises and secondly the fact that the test propounded by his Lordship in the first stage was based on foreseeability of damage alone. In 
Governors of the Peabody Donation Fund v Sir Lindsay Parkinson & Co Ltd
 
[1985] AC 210
, 240, Lord Keith of Kinkel in his speech after quoting the above passage of Lord Wilberforce`s speech said: 
There has been a tendency in some recent cases to treat these passages as being themselves of a definitive character. This is a temptation which should be resisted. The true question in each case is whether the particular defendant owed to the particular plaintiff a duty of care having the scope which is contended for, and whether he was in breach of that duty with consequent loss to the plaintiff. A relationship of proximity in Lord Atkin`s sense must exist before any duty of care can arise, but the scope of the duty must depend on all the circumstances of the case.
 In the subsequent case of 
Yuen Kun Yeu & Ors v A-G of Hong Kong
 
[1988] AC 175
, 191 that came before the Privy Council on an appeal from the Hong Kong Court of Appeal, Lord Keith who delivered the judgment of the Board after quoting the passage of Lord Wilberforce`s speech, elaborated his earlier reservation as follows: 
Their Lordships venture to think that the two-stage test formulated by Lord Wilberforce for determining the existence of a duty of care in negligence has been elevated to a degree of importance greater than it merits, and greater perhaps than its author intended. Further, the expression of the first stage of the test carries with it a risk of misinterpretation. As Gibbs CJ pointed out in 
 Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman
 59 ALJR 564, 570, there are two possible views of what Lord Wilberforce meant. The first view, favoured in a number of cases mentioned by Gibbs CJ, is that he meant to test the sufficiency of proximity simply by the 
 reasonable contemplation of likely harm
. The second view, favoured by Gibbs CJ himself, is that Lord Wilberforce meant the expression `proximity or neighbourhood` to be a composite one, importing the whole concept of necessary relationship between plaintiff and defendant described by Lord Atkin in 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 562
, 580. In their Lordships` opinion the second view is the correct one. [Emphasis is added.]
 19.Similar observation was made by Lord Bridge of Harwich in 
 Caparo Industries plc v Dickman & Ors 
 (supra) at pp 617-618: 
But since the 
 Anns
 case a series of decisions of the Privy Council and of your Lordships` House, notably in judgments and speeches delivered by Lord Keith of Kinkel, have emphasised the inability of any 
 single general principle to provide a practical test
 which can be applied to every situation to determine whether a duty of care is owed and, if so, what is its scope: see 
Governors of Peabody Donation Fund v Sir Lindsay Parkinson & Co Ltd
 
[1985] AC 210
, 239F-241C; 
Yuen Kun Yeu v A-G of Hong Kong
 
[1988] AC 175
, 190E-194F; 
Rowling v Takaro Properties Ltd
 
[1988] AC 473
, 501D-G; 
Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire
 
[1989] AC 53
, 60B-D. What emerges is that, in addition to the 
 foreseeability of damage
, necessary ingredients in any situation giving rise to a duty of care are that there should exist between the party owing the duty and the party to whom it is owed a relationship characterised by the law as one of `proximity` or `neighbourhood` and that the situation should be one in which the court considers it fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of a given scope upon the one party for the benefit of the other. [Emphasis is added.]
 Hence, the criticisms directed at Lord Wilberforce`s two-stage test were firstly, that a single general principle cannot be applied in determining the duty of care and its scope and secondly, that the test at the first stage confined the determinant of the existence of a duty of care and its scope to foreseeability of damage alone.
 20.
 Anns 
 was followed by the House of Lords in Junior Books. There, the plaintiffs engaged contractors to construct a factory for them. The contractors, being required to lay special flooring to the plaintiffs` specifications, delegated that task to the defendants, who were specialist flooring contractors. The flooring as laid by the subcontractors was defective and cracked, and the plaintiffs incurred expenses and carried out the rectification works. They claimed the cost of relaying the floor and other items of loss, such as the cost of removing the machinery and the loss of profits while the floor was being relaid. The House of Lords, by a majority with Lord Brandon of Oakbrook dissenting, held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the expenses from the subcontractors. Lord Fraser of Tullybelton who delivered the first speech of the majority said at p 533: 
The proximity between the parties is extremely close, falling only just short of a direct contractual relationship. The injury to the respondents was a direct and foreseeable result of negligence by the appellants. The respondents, or their architects, nominated the appellants as specialist sub-contractors and they must therefore have relied upon their skill and knowledge. It would surely be wrong to exclude from probation a claim which is so strongly based, merely because of anxiety about the possible effect of the decision upon other cases where the proximity may be less strong. If and when such other cases arise they will have to be decided by applying sound principles to their particular facts. The present case seems to me to fall well within limits already recognised in principle for this type of claim, and I would decide this appeal strictly on its own facts. I rely particularly on the very close proximity between the parties which in my view distinguishes this case from the case of producers of goods to be offered for sale to the public.
 Lord Keith of Kinkel also delivered a speech of the majority and he said at p 535: 
There undoubtedly existed between the appellants [the subcontractors] and the respondents [the plaintiffs] such proximity of relationship, within the well known principle of 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 562
, as to give rise to duty of care owed by the former to the latter. As formulated in 
 Donoghue v Stevenson
, the duty extended to the avoidance of acts or omissions which might reasonably have been anticipated as likely to cause physical injury to persons or property. The scope of the duty has, however, been developed so as to cover the situation where pure economic loss is to be foreseen as likely to be suffered by one standing in the requisite degree of proximity: 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465
 ... the case is not in point here except in so far as it established that reasonable anticipation of physical injury to person or property is not a sine qua non for the existence of a duty of care. It has also been established that where a duty of care exists through the presence of such reasonable anticipation, and it is breached, then even though no such injury has actually been caused because the person to whom the duty is owed has incurred expenditure in averting the danger, that person is entitled to damages measured by the amount of that expenditure: 
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
 
[1978] AC 728
, 759, per Lord Wilberforce ...
 
So in the present case I am of the opinion that the appellants in the laying of the floor owed to the respondents a duty to take reasonable care to avoid acts or missions which they ought to have known would be likely to cause the respondents, not only physical damage to person or property, but also pure economic loss. Economic loss would be caused to the respondents if the condition of the floor, in the course of its normal life, came to be such as to prevent the respondents from carrying out ordinary production processes on it, or, short of that, to cause the production process to be more costly than it would otherwise have been. In that situation the respondents would have been entitled to recover from the appellants expenditure incurred in relaying the floor so as to avert or mitigate their loss.
 Lord Roskill, who delivered the main speech of the majority, after referring to the passage of Lord Wilberforce`s speech in 
 Anns 
 (which we have quoted) said at p 542: 
Applying those statements of general principles as your Lordships have been enjoined to do both by Lord Reid and by Lord Wilberforce rather than to ask whether the particular situation which has arisen does or does not resemble some earlier and different situation where a duty of care has been held or has not been held to exist, I look for the reasons why, it being conceded that the appellants owed a duty of care to others not to construct the flooring so that those others were in peril of suffering loss or damage to their persons or their property, that duty of care should not be equally owed to the respondents.
 Lord Roskill then proceeded to apply the two-stage test and said at p 545: 
The first is `sufficient relationship of proximity,` the second any considerations negativing, reducing or limiting the scope of the duty or the class of person to whom it is owed or the damages to which a breach of the duty may give rise. My Lords, it is I think in the application of those two principles that the ability to control the extent of liability in delict or in negligence lies.
 and having referred to two New Zealand cases and 
Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council
 
[1972] 1 QB 373
 and 
 Anns 
, his Lordship then said at p 546: 
Turning back to the present appeal I therefore ask first whether there was the requisite degree of proximity so as to give rise to the relevant duty of care relied on by the respondents. I regard the following facts as of crucial importance in requiring an affirmative answer to that question. (1) The appellants were nominated sub-contractors. (2) The appellants were specialists in flooring. (3) The appellants knew what products were required by the respondents and their main contractors and specialised in the production of those products. (4) The appellants alone were responsible for the composition and construction of the flooring. (5) The respondents relied upon the appellants` skill and experience. (6) The appellants as nominated sub-contractors must have known that the respondents relied upon their skill and experience. (7) The relationship between the parties was as close as it could be short of actual privity of contract. (8) The appellants must be taken to have known that if they did the work negligently (as it must be assumed that they did) the resulting defects would at some time require remedying by the respondents expending money upon the remedial measures as a consequence of which the respondents would suffer financial or economic loss.
 Turning to the second test, his Lordship found nothing whatsoever to restrict or preclude the duty of care from arising. It is significant to observe that, notwithstanding that he followed the two-stage test in 
 Anns 
, Lord Roskill did not premise the first test on foreseeability of damage alone to found the duty of care.
 21.The House of Lords retreated from this broad statement on the recoverability of economic loss in claims for defective building in the subsequent case of 
 D & F Estates Ltd v Church Commissioners for England 
 (supra). A differently constituted House from that which heard 
 Junior Books 
 rejected the plaintiffs` claim for pure economic loss. There, the first defendants owned a piece of land, and engaged the third defendants as the main contractors in the construction of a block of flats. The plaster work was performed by the third defendants` sub-contractors. The first defendants then granted a lease of the flat to the first plaintiffs, who allowed the second and third plaintiffs to occupy the flat. It was then discovered that some of the plaster having been incorrectly applied by the sub-contractors had become loose, and in consequence fell off. The plaintiffs brought an action seeking to recover not only the cost of remedial work but also the cost of cleaning carpets and other possessions damaged by the falling plaster, loss of rent during the carrying out of the works, and damages for disturbance to the second and third plaintiffs. The House of Lords held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. Lord Bridge of Harwich who delivered one of the main speeches of the House said at p 207: 
It seems to me clear that the cost of replacing the defective plaster itself, either as carried out in 1980 or as intended to be carried out in future, was not an item of damage for which the builder of Chelwood House could possible be made liable in negligence under the principle of 
 Donoghue v Stevenson
 or any legitimate development of that principle. To make him so liable would be to impose upon him for the benefit of those with whom he had no contractual relationship the obligation of one who warranted the quality of the plaster as regards materials, workmanship and fitness for purpose.
 Lord Oliver of Aylmerton delivered the other main speech of the House and he said at pp 213-214: 
A cause of action in negligence at common law which arises only when the sole damage is the mere existence of the defect giving rise to the possibility of damage in the future, which crystallizes only when that damage is imminent, and the damages for which are measured, not by the full amount of the loss attributable to the defect but by the cost of remedying it only to the extent necessary to avert a risk of physical injury, is a novel concept.
 22.About one year later came 
 Murphy v Brentwood District Council 
 (supra), which RSP urged us to adopt. It was a decision of a specially constituted panel of seven Law Lords which expressly overruled 
 Dutton 
 and 
 Anns 
 and specifically approved the Australian High Court`s decision in 
 The Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman 
 (supra). There, the plaintiff purchased a pair of semi-detached houses constructed on a foundation approved by the local council`s consulting engineer. The foundation proved faulty and serious cracks appeared in the house. Unable to repair the house at the cost of 45,000, the plaintiff sold the house with the defects unremedied at 35,000 below what its market value would otherwise have been. He claimed against the council damages, alleging that his family had been subjected to an imminent risk to health and safety because gas and soil pipes had broken and there was a risk of further breaks. The House of Lords departed from 
 Anns 
 and held that the scope of the duty of care of the council did not extend to the kind of economic loss sustained by the plaintiff. Lord Keith of Kinkel in holding that the damage in 
 Anns 
 was purely economic loss said at p 468: 
It being recognised that the nature of the loss held to be recoverable in 
 Anns
 was pure economic loss, the next point for examination is whether the avoidance of loss of that nature fell within the scope of any duty of care owed to the plaintiffs by the local authority. On the basis of the law as it stood at the time of the decision the answer to that question must be in the negative. The right to recover for pure economic loss, not flowing from physical injury, did not then extend beyond the situation where the loss had been sustained through reliance on negligent misstatements, as in 
 Hedley Byrne
.
 Lord Bridge said at p 480: 
All these considerations lead inevitably to the conclusion that a building owner can only recover the cost of repairing a defective building on the ground of the authority`s negligence in performing its statutory function of approving plans or inspecting buildings in the course of construction if the scope of the authority`s duty of care is wide enough to embrace purely economic loss. The House has already held in 
 D & F Estates
 that a builder, in the absence of any contractual duty or of a special relationship of proximity introducing the 
 Hedley Byrne
 principle of reliance, owes no duty of care in tort in respect of the quality of his work. As I pointed out in 
 D & F Estates
, to hold that the builder owed such a duty of care to any person acquiring an interest in the product of the builder`s work would be to impose upon him the obligations of an indefinitely transmissible warranty of quality.
 Lord Oliver said at pp 485-486: 
The critical question, as was pointed out in the analysis of Brennan J in his judgment in 
 Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman
 
157 CLR 424
, is not the nature of the damage in itself, whether physical or pecuniary, but whether the scope of the duty of care in the circumstances of the case is such as to embrace damage of the kind which the plaintiff claims to have sustained: see 
Caparo Industries plc v Dickman
 
[1990] 2 AC 605
. The essential question which has to be asked in every case, given that damage which is the essential ingredient of the action has occurred, is whether the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant is such, or, to use the favoured expression, whether it is of sufficient `proximity`, that it imposes on the latter a duty to take care to avoid or prevent that loss which has in fact been sustained. That the requisite degree of proximity may be established in circumstances in which the plaintiff`s injury results from his reliance upon a statement or advice upon which he was entitled to rely and upon which it was contemplated that he would be likely to rely is clearly from 
 Hedley Byrne
 and subsequent cases, but 
Anns
 
[1978] AC 728
 was not such a case and neither is the instant case.
 23.Before we revert to Ocean Front it is necessary to revisit 
 Bryan v Maloney 
 (supra) which was relied in 
 Ocean Front 
. As it was suggested by counsel for RSP that this court`s decision in 
 Ocean Front 
 was somewhat inconsistent with the approach in 
 Bryan v Maloney 
 it is necessary to deal with the latter in some detail. There, Mr Bryan, a builder, built a house for one Mrs Manion who sold it to a couple, Mr and Mrs Quittenden, who later in turn sold it to Mrs Maloney. About six months after the purchase, cracks began to appear in the walls of the house and the damage to the fabric of the house became apparent and was extensive. It was found that the reasons for the cracks and other damage was that the house had been built on inadequate footings. Mrs Maloney sued Mr Bryan in negligence for pure economic loss, ie the amount which would necessarily be expended in remedying the inadequate footings and damage to the fabric of the house. She succeeded at first instance and on appeal the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Tasmania dismissed the appeal. Mr Bryan then appealed to the High Court which, by a majority, dismissed the appeal. In a joint judgment, Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ held that there was a relationship of proximity between Mr Bryan and Mrs Maloney which gave rise to a duty of care on the part of Mr Bryan to avoid the kind of damage suffered by Mrs Maloney. Their Honours opined that a relationship of proximity existed between Mr Bryan and persons other than the original owner, including Mrs Maloney, who might suffer personal injury or damage to property as a consequence of a collapse of the house on account of inadequate footing. In that context, the relationship between Mr Bryan and Mrs Maloney was examined and their Honours said at p 171: 
[T]he relationship between them [Mr Bryan and Mrs Maloney] is marked by proximity in a number of important respects. The connecting link of the house is itself a substantial one. It is a permanent structure to be used indefinitely and, in this country, is likely to represent one of the most significant, and possible 
 the
 most significant, investment which the subsequent owner will make during his or her lifetime. It is obviously foreseeable by such a builder that the negligent construction of the house with inadequate footings is likely to cause economic loss, of the kind sustained by Mrs Maloney, to the owner of the house at the time when the inadequacy of the footings first becomes manifest.
 They went on and held that upon analysis the relationship between Mr Bryan and Mrs Maloney was marked by `the kind of assumption of responsibility and known reliance` commonly present `in the categories of cases in which a relationship of proximity exists with respect to pure economic loss`. They said at p 172: 
In ordinary circumstances, the builder of a house undertakes the responsibility of erecting a structure on the basis that its footings are adequate to support it for a period during which it is likely that there will be one or more subsequent owners. Such a subsequent owner will ordinarily have no greater, and will often have less, opportunity to inspect and test the footings of the house than the first owner. Such a subsequent owner is likely to be unskilled in building matters and inexperienced in the niceties of real property investment. Any builder should be aware that such a subsequent owner will be likely, if inadequacy of the footings has not become manifest, to assume that the house has been competently built and that the footings are in fact adequate.
 24.The learned Chief Justice and his brother judges then compared the relationship between the builder and the first owner with that between the builder and the subsequent owner as regards the particular kind of economic loss sustained by Mrs Maloney and said at p 172: 
[F]rom the point of view of proximity, the similarities between the relationship between builder and first owner and the relationship between builder and subsequent owner as regards the particular kind of economic loss are of much greater significance than the differences to which attention has been drawn, namely, the absence of direct contact or dealing and the possibly extended time in which liability might arise. Both relationships are characterized, to a comparable extent, by assumption of responsibility on the part of the builder and likely reliance on the part of the owner. No distinction can be drawn between the two relationships in so far as the foreseeability of the particular kind of economic loss is concerned: it is obviously foreseeable that that loss will be sustained by whichever of the first or subsequent owners happens to be the owner at the time when the inadequacy of the footings becomes manifest.
 and held (at p 173) that in all the circumstances, the relationship between builder and subsequent owner as regards the particular kind of economic loss should be accepted as possessing comparable degree of proximity to that possessed by the relationship between the builder and the first owner and as giving rise to the duty to take reasonable care on the part of the builder to avoid such loss. Their Honours found further support for such relationship of proximity at p 173: 
The conclusion that a relationship of proximity existed between Mr Bryan, as the builder, and Mrs Maloney, as subsequent owner, with respect to the particular kind of economic loss is also supported by analogy with the relationship which would have existed between Mr Bryan, as the builder, and any person who suffered physical injury to person or property in the event that the house or part of the house had collapsed at the time when the inadequacy of the foundations first became manifest. It is difficult to see why, as a matter of principle, policy or common sense, a negligent builder should be liable for ordinary physical injury caused to any person or to other property by reason of the collapse of a building by reason of the inadequacy of the foundations but be not liable to the owner of the building for the cost of remedial work necessary to remedy that inadequacy and to avert such damage.
 25.In coming to the decision that there was sufficient degree of proximity in the relationship between Mr Bryan and Mrs Maloney, Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ also considered whether there was any factor or any policy considerations which precluded the recognition of such relationship and said at p 171: 
The only factor which arguably precludes the recognition of a relevant relationship of proximity between builder and subsequent owner for the purposes of the present case is the kind of damage involved, namely, mere economic loss. As has been seen, a relevant relationship of proximity would have existed between the builder and Mrs Maloney with respect to ordinary physical injury to her person or other property caused by a partial collapse of the house due to its inadequate footings even if she had not been the owner. Here again, it is important to bear in mind the particular kind of economic loss involved. As has been said, the distinction between that kind of economic loss and ordinary physical damage to property is an essentially technical one. Indeed, the economic loss sustained by the owner of a house by reason of diminution in value when the inadequacy of the footings first becomes manifest by consequent damage to the fabric of the house is, at least arguably, less remote and more readily foreseeable than ordinary physical damage to other property of the owner which might be caused by an actual collapse of part of the house as a result of the inadequacy of those footings. Again, the policy considerations underlying the reluctance of the courts to recognise a relationship of proximity and a consequential duty of care in cases of mere economic loss are largely inapplicable to the relationship between builder and subsequent owner as regards that particular kind of economic loss. There can be no question of inconsistency with the builder`s legitimate pursuit of his or her own financial interests since, as has been seen, the builder owed a duty of care to the first owner with respect to such loss.
 26.We now turn to 
 Ocean Front 
. In that case, the management corporation brought an action against the developers for expenses incurred in making good the common property which was occasioned by bad workmanship in the construction of the condominium, and the developers brought third party proceedings against the architects and the main contractors of the condominium. Among other things, a point of law was raised as a preliminary issue, namely: whether the developers owed a duty of care to the management corporation to avoid causing such economic loss and the answer to this question was decided in the affirmative. In coming to this conclusion this court considered the relevant authorities in England, Australia, New Zealand and also a Canadian authority, and opined (at p 138) that there is no single rule or set of rules for determining, first, whether a duty of care arises in particular circumstances and the scope of that duty, and, second, that in determining the existence of a duty of care and scope of such duty all the relevant circumstances would have to be examined. This court said at p 139: 
But the approach of the court has been to examine a particular circumstance to determine whether there exists that degree of proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant as would give rise to a duty of care by the latter to the former with respect to the damage sustained by the former. Such proximity is the `determinant` of the duty of care and also the scope of such duty. In 
Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd
 
[1994] 
179 CLR 520
, at pp 542-543, in a joint judgment, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Tookey and Gaudron JJ said:
 
`The ""general conception"" of a relationship of proximity was identified ( 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 580
) by Lord Atkin as the ""element common to the cases where [liability in negligence] is found to exist"" and as the basis of the duty of care which is common to all such cases. It has been stressed and developed in judgments in recent cases in the court. As Deane J pointed out in 
 Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd
 (1986) 160 CLR, at p 53: that common element of a relationship of proximity ""remains the general conceptual determinant and the unifying theme of the categories of case in which the common law of negligence recognises the existence of a duty to take reasonable care to avoid a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to another"". Without it, the tort of negligence would be reduced to a miscellany of disparate categories among which reasoning by the legal processes of induction and deduction would rest on questionable foundations since the validity of such reasoning essentially depends upon the assumption of underlying unity or consistency.`
 27.With this in mind the court turned to consider and examine the facts before it (at pp 140-141) and came to the following conclusion at pp 141-142: 
Bearing all these considerations in mind, if we may respectfully adopt the methodology and the words used by Lord Roskill in 
 Junior Books
 (supra at p 546), we regard the following facts of crucial importance in determining that there is sufficient proximity between the developers and the management corporation which gives rise to the duty of care: (i) the management corporation was an entity conceived and created by the developers; (ii) the developers were the party who built and developed the condominium including the common property and undertook the obligations to construct it in good and workmanlike manner and were alone responsible for such construction; (iii) after completion of the condominium the developers were the party solely responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the common property; (iv) the management corporation as the successor of the developers took over the control, management and administration of the common property and has the obligations of upkeeping and maintaining the common property; (v) the performance of these obligations is very much dependent on the developers having exercised reasonable care in the construction of the common property; (vi) the developers obviously knew or ought to have known that if they were negligent in their construction of the common property the resulting defects would have to be made good by the management corporation. The relationship between the developers and management corporation is as close it could be short of actual privity of contract. In our judgment, there is a duty on the part of the developers in the construction of the common property a duty to take reasonable care to avoid the kind of damage sustained by the management corporation.
 28.Having found that there was sufficient degree of proximity giving rise to the duty of care on the part of the developers, the court then proceeded to consider whether there was any policy consideration negativing such duty. The court said at p 142: 
We now turn to consider whether there is any policy consideration in negativing such duty of care. First, there is the question whether this would result in imposing liability `in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class`. The amount recoverable is the cost of repair and making good the defects in the common property and in no way can it be said to be indeterminate. The class of persons is finite and definable. As for the duration, the time span is also not indeterminate, as the maximum period of time in which the developers can possibly be exposed to liability is limited by the Limitation Act (Cap 163): see s 24B. Secondly, there is also a related objection that recovery for economic loss would result in an indefinitely transmissible warranty. The common property has been and will continue to remain in the control and under the management of the management corporation. There is no question of any transmissible warranty to any other party.
 29.It is abundantly clear that in 
 Ocean Front 
 this court did not follow the broad proposition laid down by Lord Wilberforce in 
 Anns 
. True, the court reached its conclusion by a two-stage process. In principle, there is no objection to such approach. It depends on what is involved and considered in each stage. The court certainly did not apply the first test in 
 Anns 
. The court`s finding that there was sufficient degree of proximity giving rise to a duty on the part of the developers to avoid the loss sustained by the management corporation was not premised on foreseeability of damage alone, but on the consideration of other relevant facts. Nor did the court accept Lord Wilberforce`s proposition that in any given situation a single general rule or principle can be applied to determine whether a duty of care arises.
 30.It does not follow from the mere fact that the court in the course of their determination examined the facts by the two-stage process that the court in effect followed 
 Anns 
. In the Australian case of 
The Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman & Anor
 
[1984-85] 
157 CLR 424
, which rejected 
 Anns 
, Gibbs CJ said at p 441: 
In deciding whether the necessary relationship exists, and the scope of the duty which it creates, it is necessary for the court to examine closely all the circumstances that throw light on the nature of the relationship between the parties. The judgment of Lord Roskill in 
Junior Books Ltd v Veitchi Ltd
 
[1983] AC 520
, at p 546, provides an example of the process. If a relationship of neighbourhood or proximity is found to exist, then it will be necessary to proceed to the second stage of the inquiry.
 31.Similarly, in 
 Bryan v Maloney 
 (supra) Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ in determining the existence of the relevant duty of care also proceeded by a two-stage process. Their Honours arrived at the conclusion that there was a relationship of proximity between Mr Bryan and Mrs Maloney giving rise to the duty of care on the part of Mr Bryan to avoid the kind of loss sustained by Mrs Maloney in the following manner. They considered the relevant facts and the connections between the parties and on the basis of their consideration determined that there was sufficient degree of proximity in that relationship giving rise to such duty of care. Having found that, they then considered whether there were factors or policy considerations which precluded the recognition of such relationship of proximity and arrived at the conclusion there were none. The approach this court adopted in 
 Ocean Front 
was the same as that, or at least was not inconsistent with that, adopted in 
 Bryan v Maloney 
. Stripped of the verbiage, the crux of such approach is no more than this: the court first examines and considers the facts and factors to determine whether there is sufficient degree of proximity in the relationship between the party who has sustained the loss and the party who is said to have caused the loss which would give rise to a duty of care on the part of the latter to avoid the kind of loss sustained by the former. This court in 
 Ocean Front 
 said at p 139: 
... the approach of the court has been to examine a particular circumstance to determine whether there exists that degree of proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant as would give rise to a duty of care by the latter to the former with respect to the damage sustained by the former. Such proximity is the `determinant` of the duty of care and also the scope of such duty.
 Next, having found such degree of proximity, the court next considers whether there is any material factor or policy which precludes such duty from arising. Both on principle and on authority, we do not see why such an approach should not be taken in 
 Ocean Front 
 and in a case such as the one before us.
 32.In coming to the conclusion as the court did in 
 Ocean Front 
, the court declined to follow the decisions of the House of Lords in 
 D & F Estates 
 and 
 Murphy 
. In this case, we have not been persuaded not to depart from these authorities.
 33.
 The element of reliance 
 
We now turn to the second argument advanced on behalf of RSP. It was argued before us that this court fell into error in applying 
 Junior Books 
 in that there was absent in 
 Ocean Front 
 the element of `reliance` which was crucial to the imposition of a duty in 
 Junior Books 
. It was suggested that this court considered only the foreseeability of damage in determining the issue of proximity. In support, counsel relied on the following passage of the judgment at p 140: 
... the management corporation was in fact the creation of the developers. Historically there existed a very close proximity in relationship between the developers and the management corporation. It was therefore clearly foreseeable by the developers that if in the construction of the common property they failed to exercise reasonable care and skill, the burden of making good any defects arising from their failure would inevitably rebound on their successor, the management corporation.
 34.We were unable to accept this argument. Counsel, in our view, read this passage out of the proper context. The element of foreseeability was only one of the several ingredients the court took into account. True it is that the court did not use the word `reliance`, but there were present there the very close relationship between the parties and the elements of `assumption of responsibility` and `known reliance` in the sense stated in 
 Bryan v Maloney 
. In discussing the relationship between the parties this court said, at p 141: 
(ii) the developers were the party who built and developed the condominium including the common property and undertook the obligations to construct it in a good and workmanlike manner and were alone responsible for such construction; (iii) after completion of the condominium the developers were the party solely responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the common property; (iv) the management corporation as the successor of the developers took over the control, management and administration of the common property and has the obligations of upkeeping and maintaining the common property; (v) the performance of these obligations is very much dependent on the developers having exercised reasonable care in the construction of the common property; (vi) the developers obviously knew or ought to have known that if they were negligent in their construction of the common property the resulting defects would have to be made good by the management corporation.
 Quite clearly, therefore, the court took the view that the developers assumed the responsibility of constructing the common property with reasonable care and skill and that the developers knew that the management corporation being their successor depended (or relied) on their competence in the construction.
 35.
 Caparo 
 
We now come to the third argument of counsel. It was contended that assuming 
 Ocean Front 
 was rightly decided, it should be read in conjunction with 
Caparo Industries plc v Dickman
 
[1990] 2 AC 605
, and in consequence should not be applied in a situation as the present one in which the relationship was between MCST as the management corporation and RSP as the architects, as no reliance was placed by MCST on the professional skills of the architects. The reasoning, as we understand it, is this. In 
 Ocean Front 
 the relationship was between the developer and the management corporation and that relationship was as close as it could be short of privity of contract. The management corporation did not come into effect until the registration of the strata title plan, and it was nothing more than a body corporate succeeding to the common property rights of the individual purchasers of the units comprised in the development. To that extent, the management corporation was to all intents and purposes the same party who bought from the developers as far as the common property was concerned. However, the same could not be said of the architects who were engaged by the developers for the construction of the development. First, the relationship between the architects and the management corporation was nowhere near that close as between the developers and the management corporation. The contract was between the developers and the architects and it was not a situation where there could be a contract between the management corporation and the architects. Secondly, applying 
 Junior Books 
 there was no reliance by the management corporation on the skills of the architects. Thirdly, applying the second test in 
 Anns 
, to make the architects liable would be to make them liable for an indeterminate amount to an indeterminate class for an indeterminate time. In support, counsel relied on 
 Caparo 
.
 36.In 
 Caparo 
, the plaintiffs were a public limited company which had taken over another public limited company, Fidelity plc. The defendants were the auditors of Fidelity plc. The plaintiffs claimed that in making the decision to do so, they relied upon the defendants` audit of Fidelity plc as set out in the latter company`s annual accounts. The defendants` audit was allegedly performed negligently, and it was claimed that Fidelity`s profits were not as high as the defendants had projected, a projection upon which the plaintiffs relied. The end result was that the share price paid by the plaintiffs exceeded their true value. The plaintiffs sued the defendants for negligent misstatement on the basis of 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465
, and sought to recover damages representing the shortfall in the value of the shares. The judge at first instance held that the auditors owed no duty to the plaintiffs as the investors, and that whilst they owed a duty to the shareholders as a body they did not owe any duty to any individual shareholders such as would enable shareholders to recover damages for the loss sustained by them in acting on the auditors` report. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal holding that, whilst there was no relationship of proximity between potential investors and the auditors, there was such relationship of proximity between shareholders and the auditors giving rise to a duty of care such that the shareholders were entitled to recover damages for the loss they sustained by acting on the accounts negligently prepared by the auditors. On further appeal, the House of Lords allowed the auditors` appeal. It was held that liability for economic loss due to negligence misstatement on the basis of 
 Hedley Byrne 
 is confined to situation where the statement is given by the maker to a known recipient for a specific purpose of which the maker was aware and the recipient had relied on that statement to his detriment. Lord Roskill in his speech said at pp 628-629: 
No doubt it can be said to be foreseeable that those accounts may find their way into the hands of a person who may use them for such purposes or indeed other purposes and lose money as a result. But to impose a liability in those circumstances is to hold, contrary to all the recent authorities, that foreseeability alone is sufficient, and to ignore the statutory duty which enjoins the preparation of and certification of those accounts.
 
I think that before the existence and scope of any liability can be determined, it is necessary first to determine for what purposes and in what circumstances the information in question is to be given. If a would-be investor or predator commissions a report which he will use, and which the maker of the report knows he will use, as a basis for his decision whether or not to invest or whether or not to make a bid, it may not be difficult to conclude that if the report is negligently prepared and as a result a decision is taken in reliance upon it and financial losses then follow, a liability will be imposed upon the maker of that report.
 37.
 Caparo 
 must be understood in the context of the statutory requirements of audited accounts of a company. On this we can do better than quote the following passage from the speech of Lord Oliver at p 630: 
My Lords, the primary purpose of the statutory requirement that a company`s accounts shall be audited annually is almost self-evident. The structure of the corporate trading entity, at least in the case of public companies whose shares are dealt with on an authorised Stock Exchange, involves the concept of a more or less widely distributed holding of shares rendering the personal involvement of each individual shareholder in the day-to-day management of the enterprise impracticable, with the result that management is necessarily separated from ownership. The management is confided to a board of directors which operates in a fiduciary capacity and is answerable to and removable by the shareholders who can act, if they act at all, only collectively and only through the medium of a general meeting. Hence the legislative provisions requiring the board annually to give an account of its stewardship to a general meeting of the shareholders. This is the only occasion in each year upon which the general body of shareholders is given the opportunity to consider, to criticise and to comment upon the conduct by the board of the company`s affairs, to vote upon the directors` recommendation as to dividends, to approve or disapprove the directors` remuneration and, if thought desirable, to remove and replace all or any of the directors. It is the auditors` function to ensure, so far as possible, that the financial information as to the company`s affairs prepared by the directors accurately reflects the company`s position in order, first, to protect the company itself from the consequences of undetected errors or, possibly, wrongdoing (by, for instance, declaring dividends out of capacity) and, secondly, to provide shareholders with reliable intelligence for the purpose of enabling them to scrutinise the conduct of the company`s affairs and to exercise their collective powers to reward or control or remove those to whom that conduct has been confided.
 Thus, such audited accounts are not intended to be used and relied upon by shareholders for their own investment in the purchase or disposal of shares of the company, and 
 Hedley Byrne 
 was held not to have such wide application. Lord Oliver said at p 638: 
What can be deduced from the 
 Hedley Byrne
 case, therefore, is that the necessary relationship between the maker of a statement or giver of advice (`the adviser`) and the recipient who acts in reliance upon it (`the advisee`) may typically be held to exist where (1) the advice is required for a purpose, whether particularly specified or generally described, which is made known, either actually or inferentially, to the adviser at the time when the advice is given; (2) the adviser knows, either actually or inferentially, that his advice will be communicated to the advisee, either specifically or as a member of an ascertainable class, in order that it should be used by the advisee for that purpose; (3) it is known either actually or inferentially, that the advice so communicated is likely to be acted upon by the advisee for that purpose without independent inquiry, and (4) it is so acted upon by the advisee to his detriment.
 38.In our opinion, 
 Caparo 
 has no application here. As the learned judge held and we agree, RSP were involved in the development of the condominium right from the start. They were engaged by the developers to design and supervise the construction of the condominium including the common property and the developers relied on the exercise of reasonable care and skill of their architects and they (the architects) undertook such responsibilities. RSP as the architects were aware at that time that the developers would apply for subdivision of the units and upon completion of the construction of the units they would apply to register a strata title plan and apply for the issue of separate subsidiary strata certificates of title to the units. They were also aware that upon the registration of the strata title plans the management corporation would come into existence. Vis-a-vis the developers there was an assumption of responsibility of professional competence on the part of the architects and the architects knew that the developers would be relying on their exercising reasonable care and skill. The management corporation which later came into existence was merely a statutory creation and was a successor to the developers with respect to the common property. In respect of such common property the architects knew that the management corporation would be in charge and would be managing the common property and would depend on their care and skill in the design and supervision of the construction of the common property. In such a situation there was sufficient degree of proximity in the relationship between the management corporation and the architects as would give rise to a duty on the part of the architects to avoid the loss as sustained by MCST in this case.
 39.With regard to the element of reliance which was regarded by RSP as critical, we think that it was also present in the relationship between the management corporation and the architects. The management corporation depends on the developer, inter alia, to unite resources and to co-ordinate the execution of the project, and on the architects, inter alia, to get the design of the building right.
 40.In this we are reinforced by 
Portsea Island Mutual Co-operative Society Ltd v Michael Brasher Associates
 
[1990] 6 PN 43
[1990] 6 Const LJ 63
, a decision preceding the House of Lords` decision in 
 Murphy 
. Judge Newey QC there held that the architect who was responsible for the design and supervision of a supermarket was liable for the expenses for removing certain brick slips which posed a danger to customers. The basis of the duty owed to the supermarket was the reliance on the special skill of the architect, who knew that the supermarket was the intended occupier.
 41.Relying on 
 Caparo 
 and presumably also on 
 Hedley Byrne 
 counsel for RSP submitted that professionals like architects should only be liable in negligence to a `known recipient` in respect of works carried out by them for a `known purpose`. Otherwise, they would be made liable in effect `in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class`. The short answer to this is that for the reasons given in [para ] 38 above MCST, as the management corporation of the condominium, was a `known recipient` and the work carried out by RSP for the condominium was for a `known purpose`. For the same reason as this court gave in 
 Ocean Front 
, the amount recoverable is determinate, the person to whom RSP is liable is definable and the time span is not indeterminate.
 42.It is important to understand that the concept of `economic loss`, just like the concept of `reliance` does not run uniformly through the law of negligence. It may not be considered in abstraction, but must be considered together with all the other `labels` of liability, such as `foreseeability`, `reliance`, and `reasonability;` Thus, where the loss is economic in nature, different requirements are necessary - depending on the nature of the negligent act or omission - to give rise to liability. As this court emphasised in 
 Ocean Front 
, the question is not whether a duty was owed by A to B, but whether a duty was owed by A to B to avoid the loss incurred by B.
 43.The House of Lords in 
 Murphy 
 appeared to consider that there were no special factors distinguishing negligence in the construction of a building from negligence in the manufacture of a consumer good. In so doing, their Lordships accepted the analogies painted by Lord Brandon in 
 Junior Books 
 between building construction and product manufacture. As Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ held in 
 Bryan v Maloney 
, however, there are, in our opinion, two distinguishing factors. Firstly, the investment in real property is likely to represent a significant, if not the most significant, investment in an individual`s lifetime (as opposed to the purchase of a mere chattel). The scale of the investment in money terms is far greater than what is involved in the acquisition of a chattel. Secondly, the permanence of the structure may give rise to a greater expectation than a chattel. We think those arguments apply a fortiori in Singapore, where land is not only scarce but expensive. We think that to treat houses and consumer goods alike would be to ignore simple realities, realities which, to our mind, are instrumental in dictating the expectations and degree of reliance placed upon the persons developing, building or designing the structure which stands upon it.
 44.In considering 
 D & F Estates 
 and 
 Murphy 
, it is important to bear in mind that in England there was passed in 1972 the Defective Premises Act which provided for consumer protection in respect of building defects. It seems to us that considerable weight was given to this legislation by the House of Lords in their deliberations. In particular, in 
 D & F Estates 
, Lord Bridge of Harwich (at pp 193-195) referred to this Act and the recommendations of the Law Commission report on `Civil Liability of Vendors and Lessors for Defective Premises` (Law Com No 40) dated 15 December 1970 following which that Act was enacted. In 
 Murphy 
, Lord Mackay of Clashfern L C said at p 457: 
I am of the opinion that it is relevant to take into account that Parliament has made provisions in the Defective Premises Act 1972 imposing on builders and others undertaking work in the provision of dwellings obligations relating to the quality of their work and the fitness for habitation of the dwelling. For this House in its judicial capacity to create a large new area of responsibility on local authorities in respect of defective buildings would be in my opinion not be a proper exercise of judicial power.
 Reference to this Act was also made by Lord Keith of Kinkel at p 472 and Lord Oliver of Aylmerton at p 491. And Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said at p 498: 
Parliament imposed a liability on builders by the Defective Premises Act 1972 - a liability which falls far short of that which would be imposed upon them by 
 Anns
. There can therefore be no policy reason for imposing a higher common law duty on builders, from which it follows that there is equally no policy reason for imposing such a high duty on local authorities. Parliament is far better equipped than the courts to take policy decisions in the field of consumer protection.
 45.It bears mentioning that 
 D & F Estates 
 and 
 Murphy 
 have not been followed in New Zealand: see 
Invercargill City Council v Hamlin
 
[1994] 3 NZLR 513
, and in Canada: see 
Winnipeg Condominium Corporation No 36 v Bird Construction Co
 
[1995] 121 DLR (4d) 193
. Both these cases were discussed and considered in 
 Ocean Front 
. Since then, there has been a further development in 
 Invercargill City Council 
. It went on appeal from the New Zealand Court of Appeal to the Privy Council: see 
[1996] AC 624
, and the Privy Council refrained from overturning the decision of the Court of Appeal and applying 
 D & F Estates 
 and 
 Murphy 
. Lord Lloyd of Berwick delivering the judgment of the Board said at p 640: 
But in the present case the judges in the New Zealand Court of Appeal were consciously departing from English case law on the ground that conditions in New Zealand are different. Were they entitled to do so? The answer must surely be `Yes`.
 
... the Court of Appeal of New Zealand should not be deflected from developing the common law of New Zealand (nor the Board from affirming their decisions) by the consideration that the House of Lords in 
D & F Estates Ltd v Church Commissioners for England
 
[1989] AC 177
 and 
Murphy v Brentwood District Council
 
[1991] 1 AC 398
 have not regarded an identical development as appropriate in the English setting.
 Later his Lordship referred to Canadian cases and Australian cases and said at p 642: 
Their Lordships cite these judgments in other common law jurisdictions not to cast any doubt on 
 Murphy
`s case 
[1991] 1 AC 398
, but rather to illustrate the point that in this branch of the law more than one view is possible: there is no single correct answer. In 
 Bryan v Maloney
 69 ALJR 375 the majority decision was based on the twin concepts of assumption of responsibility and reliance by the subsequent purchaser. If that be a possible and indeed respectable view, it cannot be said that the decision of the Court of Appeal in the present case, based as it was on the same or very similar twin concepts, was reached by a process of faulty reasoning, or that the decision was based on some misconception: see 
Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren
 
[1964] 1 AC 590
, 644.
 46.
 Remaining issues 
 
We now turn to the remaining issues in the appeal which were: (a). whether the trial judge erred in fact in attributing the failure of the claddings to RSP`s faulty design; and
 (b). whether the trial judge erred in finding the third party not liable.
 47.
 Design of the claddings 
 
The learned judge classified the breaches of duty complained of into two categories: breach with respect to the design of the gable end walls and breach in the supervision of the construction of the walls. The learned judge considered that the responsibilities of RSP were those of design and supervision generally. With regard to design, the learned judge found that RSP were in breach in three areas: in failing to provide the movement joints in the gable end walls; in failing to provide adequate wall ties between the inner and outer leaves of the cavity brickwork; and in failing to provide an adequate method of adhesion in the claddings. As for the supervision, the learned judge found that RSP were not in breach of duty.
 48.The issue turned on the evidence adduced. Evidence for MCST was given by Mr Paul Crispin Casimir of Casimir-Mrowczynski, who is a chartered building surveyor and at the material time was in the employ of Murray-North. He carried out most of the investigations into the incident and supervised the rectification works. There was also the evidence of Mr John Philip Jones, a chartered structural engineer and building surveyor, of Messrs Harris and Sutherland, who were appointed by the insurers. For RSP the evidence was given by Mr Alan Choe, a partner of the firm, and Ms Wong Meng Heng, the project architect for Eastern Lagoon II. RSP also led expert evidence given by Mr Yang Soo Suan, a local architect, and Dr YS Lau, a chartered civil and structural engineer.
 49.It was common ground before the learned judge that the building industry follows the British Codes of Practice and there must be specific reasons for any departure from the Codes. Such Codes states, inter alia, that consideration should be given at the design stage to the provision of movement joints in claddings along the walls. There was also produced a circular dated 13 September 1984 from the President of the Singapore Institute of Architects to its members enclosing a letter from the PWD to the President reminding members of prior instances of external tile failure and emphasising the need for good practice on the part of architects in external tiling works which included, inter alia, the provision of movement joints where the tile surface was large and continuous.
 50.The evidence of Mr Jones was that the predominant cause for the failure of the claddings was the absence of movement joints and that if there were movement joints a lack of wall ties would not cause the failure provided that there were bonding ties between the outer leaf of the brickwork and the reinforced concrete frame. Mr Casimir`s evidence was that the complete absence of the movement joints in the gable end walls was one of the main causes for the failure. The learned judge accepted the evidence of Mr Jones and Mr Casimir.
 51.Turning to the evidence in support of RSP the learned judge did not find it satisfactory. It was accepted by Mr Yang and Mr Choe that following the British Codes of Practice movement joints should be provided along stretches of wall, such as the walls in the tower blocks of the condominium in question. However, in a supplemental affidavit Mr Yang testified that it was an accepted and normal practice among the architects in Singapore not to provide movement joints for the external fair face brick and tiling works and he quoted numerous instances of multi-storey buildings in Singapore where no movement joints were provided. As for Dr Lau, initially his evidence was to the effect that the absence of the movement joints was one of the principal causes for the failure of the brick tiles. Subsequently, in his supplemental affidavit he said that the primary cause of the failure was the inadequate surface preparation of the concrete background, resulting in debonding of the tiles. The learned judge found that there was a shift in the evidence of these two witnesses. She said at [para ] 40: 
I am persuaded by the evidence that both these witnesses changed their positions because the defendants themselves, having seen the affidavit of evidence-in-chief filed by Mr Casimir which referred to the interrogatory whereby Mr Lai confirmed that the defendants did not provide movement joints in the design, changed their stand from one accepting that the absence of movement joints was the or a principal cause but blaming the third party for such absence to one accepting that it was their responsibility that there were no movement joints but claiming that such absence was not contributory or only marginally contributory to the failure. This change in position was confirmed by the defendants` opening statement filed on 25 September 1997.
 52.With regard to the letter of PWD, the witnesses for RSP gave various interpretations to the `large and continuous area`. According to Ms Wong, such area normally meant an area of 20 ft by 20 ft, and according to Mr Choe such area would be anything beyond 6 m by 12 m. Mr Choe, however, conceded that at the Keck Seng Tower, which was constructed during the period between 1981 and 1984, movement joints were at storey height intervals of less than 6 m height. As for Mr Yang, he said that the external claddings in this case were not so large and continuous as to require movement joints, but he conceded that the PWD letter was a reminder to architects that for projects like the condominium movement joints should have been provided for the brick tiles. The evidence of Mr Yang showed that in the early 1980s there were at least two high rise office buildings designed by his firm and built during the period 1981 to 1984 where movement joints for the brick/tile claddings were provided. One was NOL Building and the other was Keck Seng Tower. Clearly, RSP were unable to establish that there was an established practice not to incorporate movement joints into the architectural designs at the time of construction of Eastern Lagoon II. The learned judge came to following conclusion at [para ] 54: 
I have come to the conclusion that the weight of the evidence points to the absence of movement joints as being one of the main causes of the failure of the wall cladding in the condominium and that the failure mechanism was that put forward by the plaintiffs. I have been influenced in particular by the factors set out in paras 29 to 31 above as well as the twists and turns in the testimony of the defendants` witnesses (excluding, of course, the neutral HDB witnesses) which convinced me that whatever the validity of the technical points they made for other factors being contributory to the failure, each of them at heart believed that the absence of the movement joints played a significant part in creating the problem. I was also impressed by the objectivity and impartiality of the plaintiffs` expert witnesses. They conducted their respective investigations and prepared their reports independently of each other. Their objectives were to ascertain the causes of the failure and at the time the investigations were undertaken neither had any reason to assign blame to any particular party. They were investigating not explaining nor excusing.
 53.The learned judge also found that RSP had failed to provide adequate wall ties between the inner and the outer leaves of the cavity walls which contributed to the failure. On this she relied on the evidence of Mr Casimir who had conducted an extensive and detailed inspection of the gable end walls of the condominium and his findings were that there were negligible wall ties to the cavity brick that failed and that there were few ties to restrain the outer leaf or to allow the leaves to act as one. This evidence was corroborated by Mr Jones. There was evidence that the ties used were in accordance with the specifications. It was common ground between the experts on both sides that the untreated mild steel wall ties were inadequate for the purpose of bonding the internal and external walls together. The learned judge found at [para ] 62: 
The effect of insufficient or inadequate ties was explained by Mr Jones. He stated that had the two leaves been adequately tied together, then the load due to differential movements could have been shared between them thereby improving the strength of the wall under vertical loading by improving its buckling resistance. As it was, the inadequately tied outer leaf bore the entire load itself and this contributed to the bricks falling. In so far as the bricks which fell are concerned, Dr Lau`s view was that the lack of wall ties was one of the main causes of the bricks falling. The two structural engineers being in agreement that a lack of ties had a causative effect in relation to the falling of the bricks and there being no credible evidence to contradict this opinion, I accept it and make a finding to that effect.
 54.MCST also emphasised that the trial judge`s findings that the wall ties had corroded was reinforced by Mr Casimir`s visual inspection of the walls, including the opening up of areas in the walls and the inspection of the cavities. The sufficiency of this alleged inspection was challenged by the appellants, in that Mr Casimir`s notes, which he claimed to have left in the possession of Murray-North, were not disclosed, and their disappearance remained unexplained by the MCST when we heard the appeal. The MCST, however, emphasised that it was common ground, and agreed to by RSP`s experts, that the use of untreated mild steel was patently unsatisfactory, and that corrosion would have rendered those ties ineffective even if present. RSP failed to require that the ties to be used had to be of the quality and material specified in the British code.
 55.The learned judge also found that the general failure of the claddings was contributed by the method of adhesion adopted, ie a simple cement and sand mortar base without the use of a reinforcement mesh or additives in the mortar. In coming to this conclusion she relied on the evidence of Mr Casimir. She found at [para ] 74: 
I accept that as far as the failed panel was concerned, the substrate in that area was probably inadequately roughened. But that does not indicate an overall failure to prepare the substrate properly. It is much more likely that the generalised failure of the tiles was caused by the method of adhesion adopted, ie a simple cement and sand mortar base without the use of a reinforcement mesh or additives in the mortar. Mr Casimir as a building surveyor opined that failure is more probable than success when such a mortar mix is used for tile adhesion and Mr Yang, the defendants` expert, accepted this opinion as correct.
 56.On the evidence before her, the learned judge was justified in making the findings of fact as she did, and we could find no grounds for disturbing her findings.
 57.
 The third party`s position 
 
We now turn to the position of EC. As the learned judge found that the causes for the failure of the claddings were inadequacies in the design, EC as the contractors could not be made liable for such failure. The learned judge said at [para ] 98 and 99: 
98 I have found that the primary causes of the failure were design inadequacies, ie the non-provision of movement joints and the non-specification of the use of reinforcement mesh and wall ties protected from corrosion. Bad workmanship in the sense of inadequate numbers of wall ties being used in the brick panels was not contributory to failure in the sense that even if adequate ties had been inserted they would have corroded anyway and would not have served their purpose. As far as inadequate roughening of the substrate is concerned, my finding was that there was insufficient evidence of this and, in any case, the method of adhesion chosen by the defendants was inadequate and likely to fail. The third party cannot be held responsible for such failure. 
99 In these circumstances, the third party is not a joint tortfeasor and the defendants cannot claim any indemnity or contribution from the third party.
 We agree with the trial judge that even if the walls had been built to the utmost quality, they would have still collapsed because of the poor design. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether there was any bad workmanship in the construction of the gable end walls. We also do not propose to deal with the arguments on the issue whether EC were liable for any bad workmanship in the works carried out by their sub-contractor.
 58.In the result, the appeal failed and was dismissed.",1999-04-30 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This was a notice of motion brought by the applicants, Summit Holdings Ltd (`Summit Holdings`) and Summit CD Manufacture (`Summit CD`) to commit the respondent, Business Software Alliance (`BSA`), for contempt of court for failure to return certain documents which were ordered to be returned in Crim Rev 15/97 (`the Criminal Revision`). At the outset of the hearing, counsel for the respondent raised a preliminary issue as to whether the applicants should be allowed to rely on grounds not set out in the statement filed pursuant to O 52 r 2 of the Rules of Court in their application for an order of committal against the respondent. I reserved judgment on the preliminary issue. At the adjourned hearing, I answered the preliminary issue in the negative, and counsel for the parties proceeded to argue the substantive issue of whether the applicants have made out a case of contempt on the part of the respondent. At the end of the hearing, I found that the applicants have established beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent committed contempt in its failure to take steps to return certain documents, as well as the manner in which the same documents were used in Suit No 1596 of 1997, and sentenced the respondent to a fine of $5,000. I now give my reasons.
 2.
 Background 
 
This matter has its origins in Crim Rev 15/97 which came up before me in September 1997. Summit Holdings is a holding company listed on the SESDAQ. Summit CD is a wholly owned subsidiary of Summit Holdings. Summit CD carries on the business of manufacturing and replicating compact discs (CDs), including audio CDs, video CDs and CD-ROMs. Business Software Alliance is a tax-exempt corporation organised under the United States Revenue Code. It is an international software anti-piracy watchdog body. Its members include companies engaged in publishing and distributing computer software. On 8 August 1997, representatives of BSA applied before a magistrate and were granted two search warrants, search warrant no 132/97 and search warrant no 236A/97, to search the premises of Summit Holdings in respect of copyright and trademark offences respectively. On 12 August 1997, the representatives of BSA, police officers and solicitors from Alban Tay Mahtani & de Silva conducted a raid on the premises. On the same day, at about 11pm, they obtained a third search warrant from a High Court judge at his residence. Five CD-ROMs, a stamper, two glass masters and a large quantity of documents allegedly containing incriminating evidence were seized.
 3.Summit Holdings and Summit CD applied promptly in Crim Rev 15/97 to quash all the three search warrants. On 29 August 1997, the Attorney General`s Chambers granted a fiat to counsel for BSA, Mr VK Rajah SC and Mr Kenneth Tan SC, to defend the proceedings brought in the criminal revision.
 4.On 29 September 1997, at the conclusion of the criminal revision, I directed that the two search warrants issued by the magistrate would stand and the third search warrant granted by the learned judge should be quashed. All the items seized pursuant to the third warrant were ordered to be returned. In addition, all the items which were seized outside the scope of the first two warrants were ordered to be returned. In the result, the respondent was ordered to return all the documents (and copies) seized pursuant to the two warrants, namely: (i). the two production log-books for incoming master recordings;
 (ii). the log book on process for polishing;
 (iii). invoices;
 (iv). glass master order sheets;
 (v). mastering log sheets work orders;
 (vi). glass mastering log sheets;
 (vii). seven empty stamper boxes;
 (viii). checking report book;
 (ix). list of Summit CD`s customers allegedly downloaded from the computer server.
 5.All the above items were ordered to be returned within 24 hours from the making of the order. The result was that BSA could only keep the stamper, the CD master seized under the trade marks warrant, the five CD-ROMs seized pursuant to the copyright warrant, and the two glass masters seized pursuant to the two warrants.
 6.I now come to the subject-matter of this application. On 30 September 1997, Alban Tay Mahtani & de Silva, the solicitors for BSA, handed to the solicitors for the applicants, a letter dated the same date with a schedule of items that were returned. The applicants were not satisfied with the format in which the schedule was prepared or that all the documents were in fact returned. What followed were numerous exchanges of correspondence between the solicitors on the issue of compliance of the court order. Still dissatisfied, the applicants applied for leave to commit BSA under O 52 of the Rules of Court. That application was supported by the statement setting out the grounds of committal and an affidavit verifying the statement pursuant to O 52 r 2. Leave was granted on 13 August 1998, and the motion for committal came up for hearing on 14 October 1998.
 7.The statement set out the following acts of contempt: 
(1) BSA has not obeyed the order.
 
Particulars
 
a Some of the documents returned by BSA to the applicants pursuant to the Order were incomplete, ie pages were missing. These were as follows: 
i Original `Server List` 
Information was downloaded from the applicants` computer server and allegedly reproduced in a computer printout (`Server List`). Pages 17, 18 and 19 of the computer printout have not been returned. 
ii Photocopied `Server List` 
Pages 1 to 19 and pages 70-78 of the photocopied version of the Server List have not been returned. 
b Some of the documents (which were the subject of the Order) have not been returned. 
i Minutes of Meeting (`SO-14`) 
BSA`s representatives read the minutes of the applicants` sales meeting into a tape recorder, and then transcribed the tape recording. A cassette tape has been returned, but the original transcripts (and copies thereof) have not been returned. The said transcript was exhibited as `SO-14` in the affidavit of Stuart Ong filed in CM 17/97. 
ii Sales charts (`SO-25`) 
Information was downloaded from the applicants` computer server and allegedly printed out. The printout was exhibited as SO-25 to the affidavit of Stuart Ong filed on 1 September 1997 in Crim Rev 15/97. 
iii Extracts from Log Book (`WM-3`) 
Extracts from the applicants` production log book were read by BSA`s representative into a cassette tape, and the contents thereafter transcribed in full by BSA. The transcript and copies thereof have not been returned. They were exhibited as `WM-3` to the affidavit of William Maguire filed on 3 September 1997. 
iv Extracts of facsimile transmissions and sales orders (`WM-4`) 
Seized facsimile transmissions and sales orders were examined and excerpts were copied out by BSA onto a document. This document has not been returned. They were exhibited as `WM-4` to the affidavit of William Maguire filed on 3 September 1997. 
(2) Further BSA has sought to, or has procured or abetted others to, reproduce and openly exhibit copies of documents which should have been returned. 
Particulars
 
By an affidavit dated 14 January 1998 filed by Stuart Ong in Suit 1596 of 1997, Stuart Ong reproduced and exhibited the extracts of the Log Book and the extracts of facsimile transmissions and sales orders referred to in para 8 of the statement.
 
(3) BSA is in contempt of court. 
Particulars 
a BSA has failed to obey the Order in that BSA has failed to return documents and copies thereof, as particularised in para 3 of the statement. 
b Further, instead of returning the aforesaid documents and copies thereof, BSA has sought to misuse them by exhibiting them or by procuring them to be exhibited in an affidavit.
 8.
 The preliminary issue 
 
On the first day of the hearing, Mr Harry Elias objected to certain parts of the affidavits filed on behalf of the applicants, and parts of the written submissions of the applicants, which he argued went beyond the scope of the statement filed pursuant to O 52 r 2. Mr Elias raised the preliminary issue for determination by the court, namely, whether the applicants should be allowed to rely on grounds not set out in the statement filed pursuant to O 52 r 2 of the Rules of Court in their application for an order of committal against the respondent.
 9.From the statement, the grounds of committal relied on by the applicants were: (1). failure to return all the pages in the two documents:
 (i). transcript of minutes of meeting; and
 (ii). the photocopied server list;
 (2). failure to return the following documents:
 (i). transcripts of minutes of meeting;
 (ii). sales charts;
 (iii). extracts from log book;
 (iv). extracts of facsimile transmissions and sales orders; and
 (3). BSA has sought to or has procured or abetted others to reproduce and exhibit the documents in (2) in the affidavit of Stuart Ong.
 10.However, in the affidavits of Lee Hong Thiam filed for the purpose of the criminal revision, he alleged that there were other acts of contempt of court: (1). representing to the court that all commercially sensitive information was deleted;
 (2). breaches of the order of the (then) Magistrate Lim Kwee Huat made on 22 August 1997; and
 (3). tampering with and shredding of evidence by BSA and/or their solicitors.
 11.The second and third allegations were in Lee Hong Thiam`s affidavit made in support of the ex parte summons for leave to issue committal proceedings. The first allegation was raised for the first time in the reply to the respondent`s submissions as well as in Lee Hong Thiam`s sixth affidavit. Mr Manjit Singh conceded that these three allegations of contempt of court went beyond the statement, but urged the court to invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the court to grant leave for them to be included.
 12.Order 52 r 2(2) provides that: 
An application for such leave must be made ex parte to a Judge and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the name, description and address of the person sought to be committed and the grounds on which his committal is sought, and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on.
 13.Order 52 r 5(3) provides that: 
Except with the leave of the Court hearing an application for an order of committal, no grounds shall be relied upon at the hearing except the grounds set out in the statement under r 2.
 14.Order 52 r 5(3) makes it clear that, unless the court hearing the application gives leave, the applicant at the hearing of the application for an order of committal can only rely on the grounds set out in the statement accompanying the ex parte application for leave to apply for a committal order.
 15.This was not an appropriate case for granting leave for the applicants to rely on those grounds not in the statement for the following reasons. First, the rules concerning an application for committal would normally have to be strictly construed and complied with. The manner in which O 52 is drafted envisage that all the evidence adduced is confined strictly to the grounds that are relied upon by the applicants moving for contempt. This is without prejudice to the court`s power to order an amendment under O 20 r 8 which allows correcting defects and errors in the proceedings, which is not applicable here.
 16.The respondents relied on 
Lane v Registrar of Supreme Court of New South Wales
 
[1981] 
148 CLR 245
, to draw an analogy between the statement and a criminal charge for contempt of court. In 
 Lane v Registrar 
, it was a case dealing with a criminal charge for contempt of court. The appellant was an officer of PP, a company. K was a director appointed by the Bank of Tokyo, which was a shareholder in PP. The Bank of Tokyo received a subpoena ordering it to produce certain documents. K sought legal advice as to whether it was required to produce a certain document from L. L advised that it was not necessary. The appellant conveyed the advice from L to K. L also advised K that he did not need to produce another document not in the same transaction. Two charges of contempt of court were preferred against the appellant of wilfully procuring K not to produce relevant documents and he was convicted by the Court of Appeal. The High Court of Australia quashed the conviction on the ground that it was an element of each charge that the appellant knew it to be the duty of the Bank of Tokyo to produce the documents and this was not proved. Instead the Court of Appeal relied on other matters, not alleged in the charges, namely, that the appellant had dishonestly misrepresented L`s advice and his motive was to keep the documents away from the court in the interest of PP. However the charges were not amended to reflect the new basis on which the convictions were rested, and had to be quashed. In that case, there were charges preferred against the appellant, and it was held that the appellant could only be convicted on the charges if all the elements were satisfied. The court could not convict the appellant based on findings on matters which were not in the charges.
 17.There are many differences between a criminal charge and the statement under O 52. However contempt of court, whether civil contempt or criminal contempt, is an offence of a criminal character and must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: 
Re Bramblevale Ltd
 
[1970] Ch 128
. The purpose of the statement is to set out distinctly the grounds which the applicants are proceeding upon and to allow the respondents to have the opportunity of answering them, and, in this respect, its rationale is similar to that of a criminal charge, which is required to be sufficiently particularised so that the accused knows the case that he is meeting and has the opportunity of refuting the allegations.
 18.Here the respondent would be seriously prejudiced if it did not know the precise case which it would have to meet, especially in relation to what orders or undertakings it had breached, or acts done which allegedly amounted to an interference with the administration of justice. In fact, the grounds in relation to non-compliance of the orders of the Magistrate Lim Kwee Huat and misleading the court in the criminal revision had nothing whatsoever to do with non-compliance with the order of court of 29 September 1997, which was the only basis of contempt set out in the statement.
 19.In effect, what Mr Manjit Singh was advocating was that the court exercise its summary power to find that the respondent was in contempt even on grounds that were not in the statement. The summary power to punish for contempt should only be exercised sparingly and the decision to deal with matters summarily should not be likely taken. The power to punish for contempt summarily was intended to enable the courts to deal with conduct which would adversely affect the administration of justice. It was necessary to maintain the dignity and authority of the judge and to ensure a fair trial (see 
 Archbold on Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice 1998 
, para 28-115; 
 Borrie & Lowe, Law of Contempt 
 at pp 472-475).
 20.This case was not one of contempt in the face of the court nor was it a matter in which it was necessary and imperative for the court to act immediately and summarily. The applicants did not show that it was a case in which it was necessary for immediate action to be taken by the court in dealing with the contempt. These allegations could only be dealt with if affidavits of evidence were adduced by the respondents detailing the circumstances and explanations as to why they had embarked on a certain course of conduct. The respondent`s rights were seriously prejudiced if summary proceedings were used. Certainly the allegations here were serious, and one of them attacked the propriety of the conduct of counsel in the criminal revision. These allegations could only be made if the respondent knew in advance the exact ground on which the applicants were relying.
 21.Secondly, all the grounds on which the applicants were relying arose prior to the obtaining of the ex parte summons for leave to issue an order of committal in August 1998. The applicants had in their possession all the evidence of the alleged contempt. In fact, in relation to the second and third grounds which they now sought to bring in, they were actually in the applicants` affidavit filed as early as 31 January 1998. As to the first ground, the applicants were the petitioners in the criminal revision and would know exactly the arguments that were canvassed then and whether the allegations canvassed amounted to deceiving the court. There was no reason why they could not have raised all of them in the ex parte summons for leave to issue an order of committal, if they so wished, for the judge to consider whether to grant leave to issue the order of committal.
 22.Moreover the first ground which was relied upon by the applicant not in the statement was a serious allegation targeted at one of the counsel who was acting under a fiat from the public prosecutor in the criminal revision. It was in essence that counsel had practised deliberate deception on the court by making submissions which he knew to be untrue. That counsel was not the subject-matter of the present committal proceedings. I could really see no merit whatsoever in such an allegation being made by the applicants where BSA was the only party whom the applicants sought to commit, and not the counsel. Mr Manjit Singh argued that he must have acted on the instructions of his clients, and seemed to have ignored the trite proposition that an advocate and solicitor would be responsible for his own conduct and could not excuse his improper conduct of deliberate deception of the court on the ground that he was instructed in doing so. In any event, this allegation was completely irrelevant to the issue of whether the respondent had committed any contempt of court. The applicants could not possibly be allowed to slip by the back door allegations of misconduct in the course of the proceedings at this stage when they had every opportunity to do so but had deliberately decided not to.
 23.In the result, I ruled that the applicants were confined only to the grounds set out in the statement filed pursuant to O 52 r 2. They were only entitled to rely on acts of contempt set out in the grounds, namely, the non-compliance with the order of court dated 29 September 1997 in the following respects: (1). failure to return all the pages in two documents:
 (i). the original server list; and
 (ii). the photocopied server list;
 (2). failure to return the following documents:
 (i). transcript of minutes of meeting;
 (iii). sales charts;
 (iii). extracts from log book; and
 (iv). extracts of facsimile transmissions and sales orders;
 (3). BSA has sought to or procured or abetted others to reproduce and exhibit the extracts of the log book, extracts of facsimile transmissions and sales orders in the affidavits by Stuart Ong when they should have been returned.
 24.
 Whether BSA was liable for contempt of court 
 
At the adjourned hearing, Mr Elias submitted that the allegations of contempt were moot as they had been overtaken by events. The applicants had brought an action against, inter alia, the respondent in Suit No 1323 of 1998 for the allegedly defamatory remarks made by the latter after the raid. In that action, the applicants applied for summary judgment, and relied on most of the documents which the applicants said were improperly used or not returned. Hence he argued that, by 11 May 1999, the contents of the documents were by now well known and it was pointless to stifle any information. I had no hesitation in rejecting the argument. First, it presupposed that the only purpose of the order of court was to preserve the confidentiality of the contents of the material in or derived from the documents in a pending action and that objective had since been lost. Even if that was the sole purpose of the order of court of 29 September 1997, a proposition which I did not accept for reasons which I set out below, the contempt must be judged as at the date of commission of the acts complained of. It could not possibly lie in the respondent`s mouth to say that somebody else was also going to interfere with the course of justice and render the court`s order useless, and therefore the interference with the course of justice, flagrant as it was on the day it was committed, was subsequently hallowed.
 25.These alleged acts of contempt were all in relation to orders made in the course of criminal proceedings. Counsel for the parties accepted that there were two types of contempt. The first was civil contempt which consisted of a breach by a party to proceedings of an order made against him. The second was a criminal contempt which consisted of conduct which frustrated or impeded the due administration of justice. I thought that both types of contempt overlapped to a certain extent as the underlying policies of protection of the administration of justice and the maintenance of the court`s authority were the same for the two. In this case, I thought it was more appropriate to categorise the alleged breaches as civil contempt as the orders were directed at the respondent to the criminal revision. In any case, whether the contempt was characterised as criminal or civil, the authorities clearly established that the standard of proof in both cases was beyond reasonable doubt: 
A-G v Newspaper Publishing
 
[1988] Ch 33
; 
Witham v Holloway
 
[1995] 131 ALR 401
.
 26.In the criminal revision, BSA was the complainant for the applications for the search warrant and its solicitors and counsel obtained a fiat from the Attorney General`s Chambers to defend the criminal revision. The parties to the criminal revision were the public prosecutor and the applicants. Whilst BSA was not a direct party to the criminal revision as such, the reality was that such proceedings were de facto civil proceedings between BSA and the applicants. The solicitors acting for BSA were present when the order was made. As such there was no doubt that BSA was bound by the order of court of 29 September 1997.
 27.
 Server list and photocopied server list 
 
The original server list was the document which the solicitors of BSA, in the criminal revision, claimed was voluntarily given to the raiding party on 12 August 1997. It purportedly contained all Summit CD`s customers and the CD-ROM titles it produced. The applicants complained that pages 17, 18 and 19 of the printout of the server list, and pages 1 to 19 and 70-78 of the photocopied version of the server list were not returned.
 28.Mr Robert W Holleyman, the President and Chief Executive Officer of BSA, explained in his affidavit that the server list was actually a large volume of documents in computer readable form which the respondent had copied from the applicants` computer server in their premises in the course of the raid. The original server list was contained in a storage disk. In the preparation of the criminal revision, the solicitors of BSA made a copy of the storage disk to keep the original storage disk intact and printed documents from that copy. Not all the documents in the copy of the server were printed out. He said that BSA had returned the entire copy of the server on the storage disk, as well as the second copy of the server on another storage disk, on 30 September 1997. Also, he said that BSA had returned a certain printout of documents printed from the copy of the server to the applicants and all the photocopies of the server list. They did not have pages 1 to 19 and 70 to 78 of the photocopied list or pages 17, 18 and 19 of the original server list which the applicants alleged were missing.
 29.On the evidence adduced by the applicants, I found that there was no evidence to show that BSA had failed to return the missing pages of the server list or the photocopies. Mr Manjit Singh argued that BSA had failed to categorically say that they never downloaded or printed the pages of the documents in question; instead BSA only said that they did not have the documents. I had no hesitation in rejecting his argument. The court could not possibly draw an inference that BSA had committed contempt based on a minute construction of the manner in which an affidavit was drafted. There was no evidence to show that BSA had at the time actually downloaded the relevant pages in the documents but refused to return them. In fact it was equally likely that BSA had not downloaded those pages and had not printed them, and hence had no such pages to return. The applicants had failed to show beyond reasonable doubt that there had been a breach of the order of court in the failure to return the missing pages of the two documents.
 30.
 Failure to return: (i) the transcript of minutes of meeting; (ii) sales charts; (iii) extracts from log book; and (iv) extracts from facsimile transmissions and sales orders 
 
On this allegation, it was common ground between the parties that the above documents, collectively numbered as (i) to (iv), were never returned to the applicants after 30 September 1997. Counsel for BSA submitted that there was no breach because the documents were not within the scope of the order of court of 29 September 1997. Further, he argued that, even if they were within the scope of the order of court, they were properly entitled to retain the documents because those documents had entered the public domain.
 31.I first considered the transcript of the minutes of meeting. This was a transcript of a tape recording made by one Ron Eckstrom who was a member of the raiding party. It was not disputed that Ron Eckstrom had read aloud extracts of the minutes of a meeting into a tape which he found during the raid in the applicants` premises on 12 August 1997. This tape was later transcribed and exhibited in the affidavit of Stuart Ong, the Vice-President of BSA, filed on 29 August 1997 in the Criminal Revision. This transcript was never returned, though the tape was.
 32.Counsel for BSA argued that only a full reproduction of the original could qualify as `copies` within the meaning of the order of court. This argument was without merit. It was obvious that `copies` in the order of court could not only mean photocopies of documents or full reproductions of documents. The term must cover all recordings of information in the documents that were intelligible to the senses or capable of being made intelligible by the use of equipment, including tape-recordings, microfilms and computer database. It was absurd to suggest that BSA could obviate the necessity of returning the documents merely because it had chosen to reproduce only part of a document as opposed to the whole. The tape-recording was clearly a copy of the minutes and it followed that a transcript of it must also be a copy of the minutes.
 33.The sales charts were graphical representations of the volume of sales of CD-ROMs, stampers and orders placed by certain companies which BSA alleged were companies that were responsible for software piracy. According to BSA, the charts were prepared from data gathered from the server to assist counsel in the presentation of the case in the criminal revision. Counsel argued that the charts were not documents downloaded from the server and were not documents obtained directly from the applicants.
 34.I was of the view that the distinction which counsel tried to draw had no merit. The sales charts fell plainly within the order of court. Since the entire server list was ordered to be returned, it followed that charts and other graphical representations of the data on the server list, would fall within the order of court and should be returned.
 35.The extracts from log book referred to hand-written extracts from a logbook seized during the raid, setting out the names of the customers of Summit CD, the CD-ROM titles produced for these customers, and the dates required for the delivery of the items. The extracts of facsimile transmissions and sales orders was in a document identifying the various facsimile transmissions and sales orders by the dates of documents. For the reasons given above in relation to the transcripts of minutes of meetings, I found that they clearly were copies of the `log-book` and were within the scope of the order of court.
 36.Given that the documents which the applicants complained of were within the scope of the order of court, the further question to be considered was whether the respondent had any legitimate justification in failing to return them. Counsel for BSA argued that all of the originals of those documents were exhibited in the affidavits of Stuart Ong and William Maguire filed for the purpose of the criminal revision. He argued that affidavits filed in court became public documents forming parts of the judicial record. Hence the documents thus became public documents and there was no need to return the public documents, relying on 
 Littlejohn v BIC Corp 
 851 F 2d 673 and the dissenting judgment of Lord Scarman in 
Home Office v Harman
 
[1983] AC 280
.
 37.In 
 Littlejohn v BIC Corp 
, the respondent was cited for contempt for retaining copies of exhibits and deposition testimony admitted into evidence. The court order, known as a `protective order`, stated that at the conclusion of proceedings in the action, all documents and information subject to the protective order, including any `copies or extracts or summaries thereof, or documents containing information therefrom, shall be returned to counsel for the defendants`. The order did not explicitly cover deposition testimony read into the trial record or exhibits admitted into evidence. The Federal Court of Appeal held that the respondent was not liable for contempt as the court order did not govern the treatment of items admitted into evidence at trial as part of the public record. The court held that once the public had a right of access to the deposition testimony and exhibits exhibited in the evidence, then the documents lost their confidential status and the respondent could exercise his right of retaining copies of these documents.
 38.I accepted that BSA should be entitled to use the documents (which the applicants were seeking for their return) for the purpose of defending themselves in the criminal revision. However, I did not think that the public record reasoning in 
 Littlejohn v BIC Corp 
, taken to its logical conclusion, would lead to a desirable outcome. It would sanction or even encourage parties filing voluminous affidavits exhibiting all the originals of the documents or even items seized pursuant to search warrants or other interlocutory injunctions, and then later claim that they were unable to return the documents even when ordered to do so. This would negate the very purpose of the order of court, which was not only to prohibit the retention of items seized illegally or improperly, but was also to facilitate the return of possession of the items to the true owner.
 39.I did not think that the public record argument carried the respondent very far. The order of court was made to return documents to the applicants; this order of court applied irrespective of whether or not the documents entered the public domain. If the solicitors for BSA had chosen to file the originals with the affidavits and make them part of the public record, and the application for criminal revision later succeeded, BSA would still have to return the documents. The fact that the documents entered the public domain was irrelevant. It was really incumbent on BSA to make an application to remove the documents from the affidavits and return them to the applicants.
 40.The facts in 
 Home Office v Harman 
 were distinguishable from the present case. In that case, the questions on appeal were whether it was the duty of the solicitor of one party to civil litigation who had obtained, in the course of discovery, possession of documents belonging to the other party to the litigation, to refrain from using the documents for ulterior or collateral purpose, and whether breach of that duty constituted contempt of court. Ms Harman, the legal officer of the National Council for Civil Liberties, had disclosed some 6,800 pages of documents obtained in discovery in litigation to a journalist. The journalist`s object was to write a feature article on the issues raised by the case. At the trial, material parts of 800 pages of documents from the two bundles were referred to the court. The majority of the House of Lords answered both questions in the affirmative. This implied undertaking by the solicitor to the court was held not to terminate when the document was read out in open court in the course of the litigation for which it was produced. Discovery was an intrusion to privacy and that intrusion should be limited to what was necessary in the interests of justice for the purpose of the proceedings at hand, otherwise full and frank discovery before trial of the action would be discouraged.
 41.Lord Scarman in his minority opinion, with which Lord Simon concurred, held that the once the documents were read out in court, the duty of confidentiality terminated. He held that there was a need to balance two interests, on the one hand the protection of a litigant`s private right to keep the documents to himself, notwithstanding his duty to disclose them to the other side, and, on the other, the protection of the right of freedom of speech on matters of public interest.
 42.However, the present case was not about the scope of the implied undertaking on the use of documents obtained under compulsion in the course of civil litigation. It was not about any conflict of the two competing interests of encouraging full and frank discovery and freedom of speech, which Lord Scarman alluded to in 
 Home Office v Harman 
. It did not call into consideration the openness of justice or whether documents entering into the public domain ceased to be confidential. Instead the question was whether a party had to comply with the court order to return documents which were the subject of the court order, even if these documents were alleged to have entered the public domain.
 43.The solicitors of BSA could have avoided the practical problem of the necessity to apply to court to expunge the affidavits altogether. They could have put all the documents obtained under the search warrants, which the applicants in the criminal revision sought to recover, in a separate bundle and make available those documents for the judge or the opposite side to inspect at the hearing. If the criminal revision later succeeded, the bundle of documents would then be returned expeditiously. In fact this was what the solicitors did in relation to the log-books and some of the invoices which were tendered before the court at the criminal revision. Once those documents were tendered in court, they became part of the public domain and lost any confidential status. Yet it was never in issue that BSA was bound to return those documents to the applicants once they were ordered to do so.
 44.
 Use of documents in Suit No 1596 of 1997 
 
The third allegation of contempt of court was that BSA had used the documents in categories (i) to (iv) improperly and for a collateral purpose in Suit No 1596 of 1997, which was a separate civil action for trademark and copyright infringement brought by Microsoft Inc, BSA and Adobe Inc against the applicants. In the statement in support of the notice of motion, the applicants alleged that, by an affidavit dated 14 January 1998 in Suit No 1596 of 1997, Stuart Ong, on behalf of BSA, had reproduced and exhibited in his affidavit the documents in categories (i) to (iv). The affidavit of Stuart Ong was filed after the determination of the criminal revision. Mr Manjit Singh argued that it was a contempt of court for BSA to procure others to make copies for collateral use. According to him, it was contempt of court for two reasons: first, BSA was under an implied undertaking not to use documents under compulsion from the applicants save in relation to the criminal revision; and second, it was implied in the order of court of 29 September 1997 that the documents should not be copied or used for any purpose.
 45.This case did not, in my opinion, call for consideration whether there was an implied undertaking not to use documents under compulsion obtained in the criminal process of search warrants to be used in the civil litigation, or whether breach of such an undertaking (if any) was contempt of court. The crux of the matter was that, irrespective of whether there was an undertaking, it must follow that once there was an order of court ordering the return of documents (and copies), the use of such documents and copies in civil proceedings was prohibited, and to do so was contempt of court.
 46.Mr Elias argued at length that, in the grounds of decision of the court in the criminal revision reported in 
[1997] 3 SLR 922
, a clear distinction was drawn between the retention of evidence that was obtained under a search warrant that was quashed and the admissibility of evidence. He argued that in the civil proceedings in Suit No 1323 of 1998, the defamation proceedings, the High Court had ruled that evidence obtained under a search warrant, even though it was subsequently quashed, was admissible. Since the documentary evidence was admissible in the civil proceedings, it must follow that it was not contempt of court to use the documents obtained under compulsion in the civil proceedings.
 47.I did not accept Mr Elias`s argument. Suit No 1323 of 1998 raised completely different issues from the present case; in that suit, the defendants were not seeking to rely on the documents obtained in the course of the raid by reproducing the documents in their entirety in affidavits, or submissions in the summary judgment application. Rather, one of the issues was whether the defendants could raise, in the defence and in the affidavits filed in defending the summary judgment application, the existence of information and items which the raiding party observed in the course of the raid at the premises of Summit Holdings. Thus the issue was one of admissibility of evidence in relation to the existence of the chattels ordered to be returned, including information where the chattels were documents. It was not alleged in Suit No 1596 of 1998 that any contempt of court was committed. In the present case, the allegation was not that BSA had referred to the existence of documents which were the subject-matter of the order of court, or even the contents of the documents, in Suit No 1596 of 1997. Rather, the allegation was that BSA had gone so far as to make copies of the very documents (and copies) ordered by the court to be returned. BSA had not denied that it had reproduced the documents in their entirety and used them. Raising Suit No 1323 of 1998 was irrelevant.
 48.Once there was an order of court ordering the return of the documents (and copies), it must follow that it was not open to BSA or its solicitors to reproduce the documents in their entirety and use them in civil proceedings. The purposes of the order of court were threefold: (1) as a remedy for the improper seizure of documents, the seizure being improper because they were either not covered under the two search warrants or were pursuant to a search warrant that was quashed for want of jurisdiction; (2) to protect the owner`s copyright in the documents; and (3) to restore the true owner`s title, possession and right of control of the documents.
 49.Once the documents were ordered to be returned, the court would clearly not have allowed BSA to apply for permission to make copies of documents for collateral purposes. That would otherwise make the entire criminal revision nugatory. In fact BSA applied for an order pursuant to s 58 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) that BSA be allowed to reproduce the documents seized and that application was dismissed. I held earlier that it was incumbent on BSA to take steps to expunge the documents from the public record and to return them to the applicants. It could not be allowed to rely on its own acts of putting documents into the public domain and then seeking to use the documents for collateral purposes. To allow BSA to do so would clearly be an abuse of process of the court.
 50.I have earlier set out the reasons for rejecting the argument that the fact that the documents entered into the public domain entitled the respondent to retain copies of these documents. These reasons applied a fortiori to the use of documents for collateral proceedings. To rule otherwise would encourage parties who had obtained documents from the other side under compulsion to unilaterally release them into the public domain by filing affidavits, so that they could later be permitted to take copies of such documents for whatever collateral purposes they thought fit. The very purposes of taking out the applications for criminal revisions to quash the search warrants would be defeated; the aggrieved owners would be deprived of the remedy for the unlawful seizure of documents, nor would they have their possession of the documents restored.
 51.The next question was whether BSA had the necessary mens rea. For civil contempt, it was sufficient that the alleged contemnor be proved to have deliberately done the relevant act. This point was clearly stated by the House of Lords in 
A-G v Times Newspapers
 
[1992] 1 AC 191
. Lord Oliver said at p 217: 
One particular form of contempt by a party to proceedings is that constituted by an intentional act which is in breach of the order of a competent court. Where this occurs as a result of the act of a party who is bound by the order or of others acting at his direction or on his instigation, it constituted a civil contempt by him which is punishable by the court at the instance of the party for whose benefit the order was made and which can be waived by him. The intention with which the act was done will, of course, be of the highest relevance in the determination of the penalty (if any) to be imposed by the court, but the liability is a strict one in the sense that all that requires to be proved is service of the order and the subsequent doing by the party bound of that which is prohibited ...
 52.Mr Elias took pains to emphasise that there was never any motive to flout the order of court. BSA acted under legal advice from its solicitors and counsel at all material times. The solicitors and counsel believed that those documents were not within the order of court. In my view, motive of disobedience was clearly irrelevant in deciding a case of contempt. The breaches of the order of court amounted to contempt of court, even though they were committed on legal advice that they were not breaches: see 
Re Agreement of the Mileage Conference Group of the Tyre Manufacturers` Conference
 
[1966] 2 All ER 849
.
 53.However, I agreed with Mr Elias that the bona fides of the persons who were in contempt and their reasons, motives and understandings in doing the acts which constituted the contempt of court might be relevant in mitigation of the contempt. Bona fide reliance on legal advice, even though the advice turned out to be wrong, might be relevant and important as mitigation, depending on the circumstances. In this case, there was nothing to show that BSA had acted otherwise than in good faith and on legal advice which turned out to be wrong. It was reasonable for BSA to rely on its solicitors for the conduct of the litigation. Unfortunately for BSA, they were not well advised. They sought to use material in or derived from documents seized under search warrants which they were ordered to return, for collateral purposes which to a reasonable person must appear to be very near to the line dividing what was legally permissible and what was not. Nevertheless what were committed were technical contempts. The offence complained of did not cause any substantial prejudice to the applicants or the due administration of justice. In the circumstances, I did not think that it was appropriate to impose a high financial penalty. Instead I ruled that a fine of $5,000 should be imposed and I ordered accordingly.
 54.I made no order as to costs on the committal proceedings. It seemed to me that the proceedings could have been disposed of at a very much earlier stage if the solicitors of the applicants had acted reasonably and expeditiously in the committal proceedings. They chose not to. Instead they threw in allegations of contempt which were never set out in the statement supporting the application, when they were well apprised of those facts. They filed no less than six affidavits in these proceedings, many of which were either repetitious or raised new allegations. In the circumstances, I ruled that the applicants were not entitled to costs of the proceedings.",1999-05-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
KARTHIGESU JA
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This was an appeal against the conviction of the appellant for trafficking in controlled drugs by having in his possession on 5 June 1998, for the purpose of trafficking, 4,872.7g of cannabis and 5,678.12g of cannabis mixture. These are offences under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1993 Ed) (`the Act`). We heard his appeal on 5 April 1999 and dismissed it. These are our reasons.
 2.The appellant (Aziz) was jointly charged with one Raseed bin Ghouse (Raseed) for the above offences pursuant to their common intention to traffic in controlled drugs. At the end of the trial, Raseed was acquitted and discharged on the basis that neither the requisite possession nor common intention to traffic were proven against him beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution did not appeal against his acquittal. It is necessary, however, to review all the evidence below by reason of the arguments raised before us by Aziz`s counsel.
 3.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
On 5 June 1998, officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) began their surveillance of Aziz and Raseed after a briefing by ASP Lai Chin Fatt at about 5pm. Thereafter, the officers proceeded to their respective assigned positions to track both suspects` movements. Sergeant David Ng (Sgt Ng), Corporal Jordan Lim (Cpl Jordan) and Corporal Kassim bin Karim (Cpl Kassim) were directed to proceed to Blk 135, Bedok North Avenue 3 and keep a look out for Raseed. Sergeant Chew Swee Leong (Sgt Chew), Sergeant Goh Teck Hock (Sgt Goh), Sergeant Paul Tan (Sgt Tan) and Staff Sergeant Daniel Lim (Ssg Lim) proceeded to Blk 1024 Eunos Avenue 3 to look for the appellant`s taxi, SHA 7058M (the taxi). These officers trailed the taxi at different stages throughout the evening of 5 June 1998.
 4.At about 6pm, Raseed was seen boarding the taxi along Bedok North Avenue 3. The taxi was driven by Aziz while Raseed sat at the front passenger seat. The taxi proceeded to Blk 1024 Eunos Avenue 3, where Aziz got out and stood by the taxi while Raseed remained seated inside. Sgt Ng, Cpl Jordan (in a staff car) and Cpl Kassim (on motorcycle) waited in the vicinity. At about 6.30pm, the taxi drove past both CNB vehicles and the trail continued.
 5.At 7pm, Aziz and Raseed arrived and parked at Palmer Road. Sgt Ng and Cpl Jordan saw the appellant leave his taxi and walk towards Keramat Habib Nor Mosque at Palmer Road. Cpl Kassim saw Raseed leave the taxi and head towards the Malayan Credit Building. Both suspects returned to the taxi at 7.10pm and had a conversation. At 7.30pm, they boarded the taxi and left.
 6.They were followed to Bendemeer Road. An Indian man was seen boarding the taxi and sitting behind the driver`s seat. The taxi travelled a short distance and entered a car park. The Indian man emerged from the taxi a short while later carrying a small white plastic bag about the size of a video tape. The taxi moved on with Aziz still driving and Raseed in the front passenger seat.
 7.At 8.20pm, the taxi arrived at Serangoon Road where the suspects had drinks at Yasin Eating House. They then proceeded to Blk 57, New Upper Changi Road. Aziz spoke to a Malay man at the void deck of the block while Raseed walked to a nearby shop. The CNB officers did not notice anything else happening. The two suspects returned to the taxi at 9.15pm and then drove to Jalan Kubor, arriving at about 9.35pm.
 8.The taxi was parked along Jalan Kubor and both suspects alighted. Aziz walked to the Sultan Mosque at North Bridge Road and Raseed made his way to a back lane between Jalan Kubor and Jalan Kledek. The CNB officers lost sight of Raseed. A short while later, Ssg Lim and Cpl Jordan saw them return to the taxi, have a conversation before walking to Delight Food Galleria for drinks.
 9.Raseed and the appellant left Delight Food Galleria at about 10.15pm. Cpl Jordan observed them walking into a back lane off Jalan Kubor, but did not see their destination. They emerged at 10.55pm. Raseed was empty handed, while Aziz walked behind him carrying a dark coloured bag, which he placed in the boot of the taxi. Cpl Jordan identified this as P101, a blue `Admiral` bag (the blue bag). The suspects then drove a short distance to North Bridge Road where Raseed alighted in front of the Al Azhar Coffee Shop. Aziz reversed the taxi into Jalan Pinang and parked before joining Raseed.
 10.Meanwhile, Sgt Goh and Sgt Tan had positioned themselves at Jalan Pinang. They observed Aziz park the taxi along Jalan Pinang. At about 11.10pm, they saw Aziz return to the taxi, open the boot and arrange some things. The officers were standing behind their own car parked some 15m behind the taxi along Jalan Pinang. After about 15 minutes, Aziz closed the boot and returned to the coffee shop. At 11.40pm, Aziz and Raseed returned to the taxi and drove off. They were then arrested at the junction of Kallang Road and Lavender Street at 11.45pm by Sgt Chew, Sgt Ng, Cpl Kassim and Cpl Jordan. Ssg Lim and Sgt Goh were also at the scene of arrest.
 11.Aziz was escorted to the rear of the taxi and questioned by Ssg Lim, with Cpl Kassim acting as interpreter. The following questions and answers were recorded by Ssg Lim and Aziz appended his signature to the piece of paper: 
Q: What is inside? 
A: 
 Barang 
 [things]. 
Q: 
 Apa barang 
? [What barang?] 
A: 
 Barang salah 
 [Illegal things]. 
Q: How much? 
A: 
 Tengok sendiri 
 [see for yourself]. 
Q: Where? 
A: 
 Dalam 
 [inside]. 
Pointed to the bag. 
Open bag. 
Q: What is inside? 
A: 
 Barang 
.
 12.Ssg Lim testified that Aziz gestured to a black `USA IZZI Collection` bag (the black bag). The black bag contained a few bundles wrapped in aluminium foil. Based on his 18 years` of experience in the line, Ssg Lim stated that `barang` was understood in the context to mean drugs and `barang salah` meant illegal drugs.
 13.Later at about 12.50am, a party of CNB officers led by Inspector Jason Tan (Insp Tan) arrived. Insp Tan further questioned Aziz as follows (translated from Malay): 
Q: What is inside the boot? 
A: I don`t know. 
Q: Whose bag is that? (pointing to the dark coloured bag in the boot). 
A: That Indian fellow. I don`t know who he is. 
Q: What is inside the bag? 
A: 
 Barang salah 
.
 14.After the arrest, Aziz and Raseed were brought back to Jalan Kubor where the CNB officers raided No 2 Jalan Kledek and arrested three persons found in the house. Nothing turned on these three persons nor the raid at Jalan Kledek. None of the prosecution`s witnesses actually saw either Aziz or Raseed enter a house along Jalan Kledek or Jalan Kubor.
 15.A search of the taxi at 5.35am on 6 June 1998 by Sgt Tai Kwong Yong and Sgt Patrick Phoa in the presence of Aziz and Raseed uncovered 15 packages of what were later certified as cannabis or cannabis mixture. Six packages were in the black bag, three were in a large plastic bag and six were stacked in pairs at the back of the right end of the boot.
 16.After this, Aziz and Raseed were searched by ASP Paschal Reibeira (ASP Reibeira), the investigating officer. The following items, inter alia, were found on Aziz: cash in the sum of S$1,339, $14 in Brunei currency, a handphone, a pager and a calculator. Raseed was found with, inter alia, cash in the sum of $4,589, a fake Rolex watch, a Seiko watch, one house key and a pager on his person.
 17.On 11 June 1998, a more thorough search was made of the taxi by ASP Reibeira. He found more cannabis hidden in the boot, in crevices inside the boot and on the right side of the driver`s seat. A green weighing scale, a chopper, a knife, a hammer and a pair of scissors were also found in the boot while two paper cutters, a pair of scissors and empty transparent plastic sachets were found in the side pouch of the driver`s door.
 18.Aziz was questioned on 11 June 1998 about the additional cannabis and items found. He denied that the drug exhibits were his. He said they belonged to the Indian man he picked up in his taxi, who carried one shoulder bag and one plastic bag which the Indian man put into the boot. Raseed said he did not know anything about the drug exhibits and items seized.
 19.A Department of Scientific Services (DSS) officer analysed all the vegetable matter seized (P80, P84, P86 to P92), save for four packages, in accordance with DSS laboratory protocol. These four packages were not included in the overall weight of the subject matter of the two joint charges. The officer found that the vegetable matter analysed contained 4,872.7g of cannabis and 5,678.12g of cannabis mixture. In addition, some of the drug trafficking paraphernalia, namely the green weighing scale (P93), one chopper and one knife (collectively P94) and two cutters (P98) were stained with tetrahydracannabinol and cannabinol. The two cutters were found in the driver`s door pouch while the rest were found in the boot. The officer`s findings were not challenged by both defence counsel below.
 20.
 Cautioned statements from Aziz and Raseed 
 
The prosecution adduced the cautioned statements of both Aziz and Raseed. In his statement made on 6 June 1998, Aziz claimed that the black bag and a plastic bag were placed in the boot by an Indian passenger whom he picked up somewhere near Serangoon Road and Desker Road. This passenger alighted along Victoria Street at Jalan Kubor but left the bags in the boot. Aziz said he then parked his car at Jalan Kubor and proceeded to Sultan Mosque for prayers. When he returned, he remembered the bags left in the boot, so he pushed the two bags towards the inner compartments of the boot to make space for other things. He then went for coffee at Jalan Pisang when Raseed approached him and asked him for a ride to Bedok.
 21.In his cautioned statement, Raseed said that he was having his coffee at a coffee shop in front of Sultan Mosque when he saw a taxi driver going to a taxi. He approached the driver and asked to be taken to Bedok. He then recounted the circumstances of the arrest by CNB officers. The distinct impression left by the statement, as the court below noted, was that Raseed was not acquainted with Aziz and he only chanced upon him after finishing his coffee.

 Aziz`s further statement on 20 August 1998 
 
Aziz made a further statement on 20 August 1998, the voluntariness of which was not challenged below by his counsel. He admitted that he had lied about his movements on the 5 June 1998 as he was afraid; he knew the offence carried the death penalty. Instead, he gave the following account. He was paged by Raseed on 5 June 1998, who asked for a lift from his Bedok North flat to Cecil Street. They arrived there at 7pm and Raseed got off to speak to a friend while Aziz remained in the taxi. Raseed then asked to be driven to Bendemeer Road, where they picked up an Indian man. Aziz heard Raseed `talk about some ""barang"" to this Indian man` and then saw Raseed give a light coloured plastic bag containing this `barang` to the Indian man, having taken the `barang` from under his seat cover. He said he knew this barang to be cannabis as he could identify the pungent smell. The Indian man was then dropped off a short distance later.
 23.After visiting Aziz`s friend at Blk 57 New Upper Changi Road, Raseed instructed him to go to Jalan Kubor. Arriving at 9.30pm, Aziz left for the Sultan Mosque while Raseed went to No 2 Jalan Kledek. They met later at a coffee shop and both then proceeded to a travel agency at No 2 Jalan Kledek. There, Raseed instructed him to go upstairs and collect a blue `Admiral` bag. At this point, Aziz said he did not know it was cannabis in the bag. When he came down, Raseed asked him to place the bag in the boot of the taxi. They then went for a meal.
 24.Five minutes later, Aziz left Raseed at the coffee shop and returned to the taxi. He had suspected that the blue bag contained cannabis, so he opened the boot, unzipped the bag and saw packages inside wrapped in silver foil and plastic. He knew these to be cannabis from their pungent smell. There were also some smaller plastic bags and sachets which contained cannabis. Aziz said he was afraid and decided to hide the packages. He took some plastic sachets of cannabis and hid them in the left side of his driver`s seat so that he could smoke them later. The larger packets of cannabis were stacked and hidden in the inner left and right sides of the boot or placed in the smaller black bag. All this was done so as to create more space in the boot.
 25.Aziz then returned to the coffee shop. After the meal, he asked Raseed why he was carrying the cannabis. Raseed told him that he was delivering the cannabis to Geylang and asked Aziz to take him there. They were intercepted by the CNB officers while on their way there.
 26.
 Raseed`s further statement 
 
Raseed also gave a further statement to ASP Reibeira on 18 August 1998. The admissibility of this was also not challenged by his counsel. He stated that he made a living selling semi-precious stones at a stall at No 4 Jalan Pisang, but was not working on the Friday in question. Sometime after 5pm that day, Aziz called asking Raseed to accompany him to meet Aziz`s friends.
 27.Raseed admitted that he knew Aziz to be a cannabis trafficker and that Aziz was going that day to meet his customers and his friends. When he entered the taxi at Bedok North Avenue 3, Raseed saw cannabis inside red plastic bags kept in the side door pouch. When asked, Aziz said that the cannabis was meant for his customers.
 28.At 6.15pm, Aziz drove to Eunos Avenue 3 where he met a man named Ali. Aziz sold him two or three plastic sachets of cannabis for a few hundred dollars. They then went to Palmer Road and Bendemeer Road. Along Bendemeer Road, Aziz picked up an Indian man who asked him for cannabis. Aziz passed him a red plastic bag which Raseed estimated contained about 400g of cannabis, in exchange for a few hundred dollars. Aziz took the cannabis from under his seat cover. The Indian man got off a short distance later. They both then had drinks somewhere along Serangoon Road before moving on to New Upper Changi Road. Aziz met up with another Malay man near a block of flats. Raseed did not join them but went to a watch shop. They thereafter proceeded to Jalan Kubor where Aziz said he was going to deliver cannabis to a friend.
 29.Arriving at Jalan Kubor after 9.30pm, they had drinks again at a coffee shop. Later both went to a travel agency along Jalan Kledek. Raseed said he waited downstairs while Aziz went upstairs, where he remained for about 20 minutes. He emerged carrying a `long dark coloured travelling bag` that looked full and heavy. Aziz instructed him to walk ahead to the taxi. Once there, Aziz placed the bag in the boot. Raseed however did not ask Aziz what was in the bag. Once in the taxi, Aziz suggested that they go to a coffee shop along North Bridge Road. Raseed got off earlier along the road and Aziz parked the taxi along Jalan Pinang. After a few minutes, Aziz said he was returning to the taxi to `rearrange things`. He was done in about ten minutes and returned to finish his meal. Thereafter Aziz offered Raseed a lift home to Bedok.
 30.Raseed explained that, although he was aware of Aziz`s trafficking in cannabis, he was afraid to inform the police as he had a previous criminal and drug record. This was the second time that he accompanied Aziz in his taxi as the latter delivered cannabis, the earlier occasion being sometime in late May 1998. Raseed said he followed Aziz on his trips as he had nothing else better to do. He also mentioned that Aziz had previously asked him to recommend customers, but potential customers were reluctant as Aziz`s activities were believed to be monitored by the CNB.
 31.
 Aziz`s evidence at trial 
 
At the close of the prosecution`s case, counsel for Aziz declined to make any submission. The court heard submissions from Raseed`s counsel and found that there was sufficient evidence to call for his defence. Both Aziz and Raseed elected to give evidence. Aziz`s account of the events on 5 June 1998 substantially reiterated his account in his statement of 20 August 1998. In addition, he stated that the black bag was given to him by Raseed. On searching it a few days later, he discovered that it contained all the drug trafficking paraphernalia found in the taxi. These included the weighing scale, knife, chopper and plastic sachets. Aziz thought that Raseed wanted to give him the bag, so he removed its contents and left them in the boot. However, Aziz placed two paper cutters, a pair of scissors and some plastic sachets in the driver`s door pouch of the taxi and under his driver`s seat. He testified that he did so in order to have easy access to them.
 32.With regard to the collection of the blue bag from No 2 Jalan Kledek, Aziz stated that he did not ask Raseed what was in the bag, but Raseed nevertheless mentioned that he did not know what was in the bag. Aziz did as he was asked and carried the blue bag to the taxi and placed it in the boot. Raseed asked Aziz to drive him home, but Aziz wanted to have a meal first, so he drove to the nearby Al Azhar coffee shop.
 33.After ordering his food, Aziz said he returned to the taxi because he was curious about the contents of the bag, suspecting it to contain cannabis. He opened the blue bag and noticed plastic bags containing a greenish vegetable matter. Some of these bags fell out into the boot. There were also other blocks wrapped in aluminium foil in the bag, but this time Aziz said that he did not suspect them to contain cannabis. Aziz was momentarily shocked and afraid on discovering the cannabis. He explained that he rearranged the contents of the blue bag in order to make more space in the boot in case he should have to pick up more passengers while sending Raseed home.
 34.
 Raseed`s evidence at trial 
 
Raseed`s testimony was as follows. He was awoken from his afternoon nap by Aziz`s telephone call, offering to drive him to his regular haunt at Jubilee Restaurant along North Bridge Road. Substantially the same itinerary was narrated covering the stops at Jalan Eunos, Palmer Road, Bendemeer Road, New Upper Changi Road before they arrived and parked along Jalan Kubor. However, at Jalan Eunos, Raseed stated that he did not know the contents of the package handed to Aziz`s friend Ali. At Bendemeer Road, Raseed recounted that Aziz passed the Indian man a package through the two front seats with his left hand. He denied any knowledge of the specific contents of the package but suspected that they contained something illegal.
 35.At Jalan Kubor, they went their separate ways. Raseed took a short cut through a back lane towards Jubilee Restaurant but found it closed. He then went to Al Azhar coffee shop. As far as Raseed was concerned, they had parted company for the evening, but sometime later, he saw Aziz crossing the road towards the Al Azhar coffee shop. Aziz asked him if he wanted a ride to Bedok and Raseed agreed.
 36.Both of them then walked towards Jalan Kubor. Midway along Jalan Kledek, Aziz told him to wait and then disappeared round the corner. Shortly thereafter, Raseed went round to look for him and eventually saw him walking along a pathway near No 2 Jalan Kledek carrying a bag with him. Aziz gesticulated with his hand to move on and they walked to the taxi. Aziz then loaded the bag in the boot. They drove off for Bedok, but Aziz told Raseed to wait at the Al Azhar coffee shop because he wanted to tidy his taxi. Thereafter, events proceeded as described in his further statement (see [para ] 29 above) before they were arrested.
 37.Finally, Raseed made clarifications in his examination-in-chief concerning certain admissions he made on his knowledge of Aziz`s activities in his 18 August 1998 statement. First, he stated that he knew about Aziz`s cannabis trafficking activities only with the benefit of hindsight. Prior to the arrest, he only knew that Aziz dealt with `illegal things`. He used the word `cannabis` at ASP Reibeira`s suggestion because cannabis was subsequently seized from Aziz`s taxi. Second, Raseed clarified that when he first entered the taxi, he did not know what the contents of the red plastic bag in the driver`s side pouch were. He denied telling ASP Reibeira that he knew that the cannabis was meant for Aziz`s customers or that knew Aziz was selling cannabis to the Malay man named Ali. He only knew that Aziz had dealings with his friends and handed Ali a plastic package. Likewise for the transaction with the Indian male, Raseed denied knowledge at the time of the contents of the plastic bag handed to the Indian male. Third, Raseed denied telling ASP Reibeira that he waited downstairs at No 2 Jalan Kledek while Aziz went upstairs. Finally, Raseed similarly denied that Aziz informed him of his drug trafficking activities and that he recommended customers to Aziz for this purpose. Raseed explained that Aziz only asked him to recommend friends to buy `things` from him. In summary, Raseed sought to disassociate himself from any specific knowledge that Aziz was trafficking in cannabis.
 38.
 The decision below 
 
The court below found that Aziz was in possession of the cannabis and cannabis mixture (the drugs) seized. The undisputed evidence showed that Aziz was the registered lessee of the taxi and was the only driver of that vehicle at all material times. He was observed to be handling the drugs in the boot of his taxi. Finally, by his own admission, he knew the contents were cannabis and had removed some sachets from the large bag and kept them for his own consumption.
 39.The learned judicial commissioner rejected Aziz`s explanation that the drugs and related paraphernalia belonged to Raseed. He found Aziz to be an entirely unreliable witness on the basis of material contradictions with his previous statements and its incredibility.
 40.In respect of the case against Raseed, the court found that Raseed`s association with Aziz throughout the evening of 5 June 1998 was insufficient evidence of his guilt or a common intention to traffic. The scrutiny of the CNB officers` surveillance did not reveal any evidence of Raseed handling the cannabis at all. Secondly, the only direct evidence implicating Raseed was that of Aziz`s testimony. The court found him to be a self-serving witness and did not give any serious consideration to Aziz`s evidence. Third, although there were various untruths and inconsistencies in Raseed`s evidence, these did not have any connection with the direct and incriminating evidence against Raseed and were inadequate to establish his guilt. Finally, even if Raseed knew of Aziz`s drug trafficking activities when he joined him on 5 June 1998, this knowledge alone was insufficient to establish a common intention to traffic. Raseed`s conduct was equally consistent with an innocent accompaniment of Aziz and in the absence of any statutory presumptions operating against him, the prosecution had failed to establish its case against him beyond a reasonable doubt.
 41.
 The appeal 
 
The petition of appeal essentially raised three grounds of appeal. First, that the court below erred in convicting Aziz as the prosecution had not established that the drugs seized were in his possession. Secondly, that the prosecution had not established all the ingredients of the charge against the appellant. Finally, and in particular, the court below erred in accepting the evidence of Raseed and rejecting the evidence of Aziz in finding that the latter had failed to rebut the presumption under s 17 of the Act. Before us however, counsel for Aziz only proceeded on the last ground. We nevertheless propose to review the other two grounds of appeal.
 42.
 Possession 
 
The offence of trafficking in a controlled drug by having that drug in one`s possession for the purpose of trafficking is bolstered by the presumption in s 17 that `any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than ... (d) 15 grams of cannabis; (e) 30 grams of cannabis mixture ... shall be presumed to have had that drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose`. Section 18(2) further provides that any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. In 
Low Kok Wai v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 676
 , it was held at p 683 that: 
By omitting those two words [`or presumed`] in the later version, Parliament must have intended that the presumption of trafficking in s 17 was only to apply where a person was proved to be in possession of a controlled drug and not merely presumed to be in possession of a controlled drug ... In our judgment, Parliament, by deleting the words `or presumed`, has shown abundantly that it did not intend to create a situation of triple presumption, namely, linking ss 18(1), (2) and 17.
 43.This reasoning must also apply when the other presumptions in ss 18 to 21 are relied on. Accordingly, if the prosecution sought in this case to rely on s 17 to establish the requisite mens rea of possession for the purpose of trafficking, they could not utilise the presumption relating to the ownership or control for the time being of a vehicle when a controlled drug is found in such a vehicle (s 21 of the Act). Insofar as the court below and the respondent suggested that s 21 could be utilised to establish possession for the purposes of s 17, we considered that they were mistaken.
 44.Possession of the drugs by Aziz must therefore be established beyond a reasonable doubt. In 
Fun Seong Cheng v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 523
 , this court reiterated that possession comprised physical control over the drugs in question and knowledge of the existence of the `thing` itself and not its qualities, following 
Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner
 
[1969] 2 AC 256
. Aziz was the sole registered lessee of the taxi and only driver of the vehicle at all material times whilst under CNB surveillance. Apart from the operation of a s 21 presumption, these facts were nevertheless relevant in indicating that he had physical control over the contents of the vehicle and its boot. Secondly, two CNB officers observed him arranging items in the boot of the taxi that evening for some ten minutes. Most importantly, by his own admission and defence, Aziz knew that the blue bag contained cannabis. He went so far as to remove the contents of the bag and transfer them to various parts of the boot, the black bag and the side of his seat. Although Aziz claimed at trial that he did not suspect that the aluminium foil wrapped bundles also contained cannabis, he admitted earlier in his further statement that he suspected their contents. His knowledge of their existence, their juxtaposition with the transparent packets of cannabis and the fact that he attempted to hide all the bundles were more than sufficient knowledge for this purpose. In the circumstances, there could not be any reasonable doubt that Aziz had possession of the drugs in question.
 45.
 Ingredients of the charge 
 
Possession having been proved against Aziz, the presumptions under ss 17 and 18(2) then operate. There was also no challenge that the vegetable matter found in his possession were controlled drugs within the meaning of s 5(1) read with s 2 of the Act, namely, cannabis and cannabis mixture. Thus, subject to Aziz`s successful rebuttal of these presumptions, the prosecution had established all the elements of the offence in question.
 46.It will be remembered that Aziz and Raseed were jointly charged that pursuant to the common intention of them both they had committed the offence of trafficking in controlled drugs by being in possession of cannabis and cannabis mixture. At the end of the trial the learned trial judge found as a fact that Aziz alone was in possession of the cannabis and the cannabis mixture. Accordingly he acquitted Raseed of the joint charge as common intention had not been proved against him and proceeded to convict Aziz on the joint charge.
 47.We wondered whether the learned trial judge ought to have amended the charge before convicting Aziz of the charge of trafficking by being in possession of the cannabis and the cannabis mixture. Counsel for Aziz did not suggest any prejudice to Aziz by the learned trial judge not amending the joint charge before convicting Aziz. In fact our careful perusal of the record of proceedings revealed that the mode of trial and Aziz`s defence were not prejudiced by the joint charge not being amended. In the circumstances the conviction of Aziz on the joint charge was perfectly proper.
 48.
 Rebuttal of the presumption 
 
Based on counsel for Aziz`s submissions, the crux of the appeal resolved itself into the question whether Aziz rebutted the presumption under s 17 on a balance of probabilities. Counsel`s contention was that the court below erred in deciding that it was Aziz who was the trafficker rather than Raseed. The arguments in support were as follows.
 49.
 Inconsistencies in Raseed`s testimony 
 
First, there were material inconsistencies between Raseed`s oral testimony and his statement given to ASP Reibeira on 18 August 1998. His assertion that he owned a stall selling semi-precious stones at No 4 Jalan Pisang was retracted during examination-in-chief. Raseed explained that it was a mistake; what he meant was that he had a stall four doors away from Jubilee Restaurant at the junction of Jalan Pisang and North Bridge Road. The evidence of one Mohamed Osman bin Abdul Jabar, chief tenant of No 10 Jalan Pisang, was that his was the only shop along Jalan Pisang which sells semi-precious stones. He had never seen nor employed Raseed before.
 50.This inconsistency was connected to Raseed`s explanation for the sum of $4,589 found on him. Counsel for Aziz argued that Raseed had failed to adequately account for this sum, leading to the inference that this sum must have represented his gains from drug trafficking. Raseed testified that the amount was partly from his business of selling semi-precious stones and imitation watches and partly from his savings accumulated while he was working for the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) in prison. Further, he told the CNB on the day of his arrest that $3,000 of this sum was for the payment of the rental of his stall. From the foregoing, it is quite inaccurate for counsel to contend that Raseed failed to provide a plausible account for the sum in question. His evidence of his savings from previous employment was not contradicted. Further ASP Reibeira also confirmed that a search of Raseed`s home and person did not reveal any bank account books or ATM cards. It was thus entirely possible that Raseed was perfectly comfortable with carrying most of his money on his person. In addition, the assertion that the CNB search of his home did not recover any semi-precious stones or fake watches is not entirely accurate. None of the CNB officers who searched the house, including ASP Reibeira, were directly asked whether they had searched for such items. On the whole, even though Raseed`s evidence concerning his principal means of income was tenuous, it only supported the weak inference that the money may have been ill-gotten.
 51.Secondly, counsel for Aziz was correct to point out a change in Raseed`s account of their visit to No 2 Jalan Kledek. In his 18 August 1998 statement, he claimed that he waited downstairs while Raseed went upstairs to fetch the blue bag. In court, this was retracted on the basis that he did not say this to ASP Reibeira. Instead, his evidence was that he was told to wait along the back lane between Jalan Kledek and Jalan Kubor and thus did not see where Aziz actually went. On the whole, there were numerous reasons to question the credibility of Raseed and he was indeed an unreliable witness. During cross-examination, he admitted that his previous statements made on 10 and 17 June 1998 (not adduced) contained untruths. However, what proper inferences could be made from these inconsistencies and untruths? As the court below rightly pointed out, these did not relate to direct evidence implicating him. We considered that they suggested at most the inference that Raseed was far more knowledgeable of Aziz`s activities than he admitted and was anxious to disassociate himself from Aziz to a further extent than was properly the case. They did not of themselves suggest, in the absence of direct evidence, that Raseed had possession of the drugs and that it was for the purpose of trafficking. Even if there was a basis for this inference, it is a quantum leap to say that such possession was to the exclusion of Aziz`s complicity and that the latter was a mere stooge.
 52.
 Raseed`s association with Aziz 
 
Counsel for Aziz next argued that Raseed`s association throughout the evening with Aziz was incriminatory considering the fact that (a) Raseed`s objective was to get a lift to Jubilee Restaurant, which had closed by the time they got to Jalan Kubor and (b) Raseed`s presence would have been prejudicial to Aziz`s drug trafficking activities and exposed him to the possibility of blackmail. Be that as it may, these considerations must be weighed against the direct evidence implicating Aziz and his credibility as a witness.
 53.First, drug paraphernalia was found in Aziz`s possession in the taxi. Aziz admitted in cross-examination that these paraphernalia were in his possession, but sought to explain that they were given to him by Raseed in the black bag. Aziz alleged that Raseed passed him the bag containing the paraphernalia as a gift. He was simply content to leave it in his boot without asking what was in the bag or checking its contents. In contrast, the two cutters and the plastic sachets were all found within easy access from the driver`s seat while the rest were found in the boot. If the paraphernalia belonged to Raseed and Aziz had no use for them, why the need to keep them in the taxi in places that suggested that they were being used by Aziz? Further, by Aziz`s own evidence, he had only conveyed Raseed on three or four previous occasions in his taxi and these were only short trips. We found this explanation improbable and the learned judicial commissioner was fully entitled to reject it.
 54.Secondly, there was a conspicuous absence of any direct evidence of Raseed handling the drugs or paraphernalia, in spite of the constant surveillance of the CNB officers throughout the evening of 5 June 1998. Nothing incriminating was found in and around Raseed`s front passenger seat. In contrast, Aziz was the party who drove at all times, who was seen arranging the contents of the boot and who carried the blue bag from Jalan Kledek to the taxi. In his statement of 20 August 1998, Aziz claimed that Raseed had taken the package he passed to the Indian male from under his seat cover. However, his own evidence was that Raseed did not carry anything when he first boarded the taxi. Aziz failed to adequately account for how the package, if it came from Raseed, ended up underneath the seat cover of his taxi. Counsel for Aziz added that it was more likely that Raseed had passed the package to the Indian male since he was sitting diagonally in front of the Indian male, while Aziz was driving at the time. However, none of the CNB officers could see what happened while the Indian male was in the taxi. Raseed`s evidence that Aziz passed the package using his left hand was equally plausible. We found this evidence equivocal at most. It was also argued that Raseed`s knowledge of the weight of this package was incriminatory. However, Raseed`s testimony was that this was a mere estimation, and there was no independent evidence to affirm or disaffirm that this was indeed the weight of the package since it was never retrieved.
 55.Thirdly, several portions of Aziz`s evidence were also incredible. He testified that when asked to carry a bag for Raseed from No 2 Jalan Kledek, Raseed told him the bag was his but that he himself did not know the contents of the bag. Neither did Aziz bother to ask what was in the bag; he just carried it from No 2 Jalan Kledek to the taxi.
 56.In respect of Aziz`s alleged discovery of the cannabis in the boot, he claimed that he was momentarily shocked and afraid at the discovery and was well aware of the penalties involved in drug trafficking. Yet he was content to remove the entire contents from the blue bag, transfer some blocks to the smaller black bag and hide the rest in the boot, his main concern instead being to create space in the boot as the contents had `spilled` out of the bag. He did not bother to tell Raseed that he had rearranged the contents of the bag nor could he even recall asking Raseed about the nature of the contents. This was in spite of the fact that Aziz had a strong suspicion that the contents of the blocks were cannabis by reason of the pungent smell he detected in the boot. We found the above account was far more consistent with Aziz`s ownership of the drugs than Raseed`s.
 57.Fourthly, Aziz`s account was in complete contradiction to his earlier accounts given on arrest on 5 June 1998 and in his cautioned statement, where he alleged that the black bag and a plastic bag containing cannabis were left in the boot by a male Indian passenger. On the whole, the court below was fully justified in finding Aziz a wholly unreliable witness and rejecting his evidence completely. This finding was made with the benefit of hearing and seeing both accused give testimony and we were not minded to disturb it.
 58.Counsel further argued that, in spite of Raseed`s allegation that (a) he knew of Aziz`s drug trafficking activities and (b) had even tried to recommend his friends to buy drugs from Aziz, Raseed continued to follow Aziz around. This must also be indicative that Raseed was involved in the drug trafficking. In respect of the second admission, we considered that the learned judicial commissioner rightly excluded this on the ground that it was simply not relevant. The admission in respect of previous abetments of trafficking were too vague and dissimilar to be of any probative value in determining if Raseed was in possession of the drugs for the purposes of trafficking or had the requisite mens rea. In respect of the former, even if we were to accept that the statement was an accurate record, Raseed`s decision to accompany Aziz was equally consistent with a mere ambivalence to Aziz`s activities and did not go very far in establishing Raseed`s culpability to the exclusion of Aziz.
 59.
 Conclusion 
 
In summary, the thrust of the arguments mounted above missed the point. Even if Raseed was an unreliable witness who failed to account for money in his possession, he was not under the burden of discharging any presumption raised against him. The matters raised by the appellant did not found any proper basis for the inference that Raseed was the true mastermind of the operation to the exclusion of Aziz. At most, it only suggested his complicity in the events. The court below was however not satisfied that this was proven beyond a reasonable doubt in the absence of compelling direct evidence implicating Raseed. In contrast, the direct evidence and incredibility of Aziz`s testimony weighed heavily against him. Accordingly, he failed on a balance of probabilities to rebut the relevant presumption.
 60.In the result, the appeal failed and we dismissed it.",1999-05-06 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This was an appeal against the decision of a district judge where he held that composition under s 199 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) was not appropriate for the offences charged.
 2.
 The facts 
 
The first appellant Kee Leong Bee (`Kee`) was charged with one count of voluntarily causing hurt to her domestic maid (`the victim`), contrary to s 323 read with s 73(1)(a) and s 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224), for using her hands to slap and knock the victim on her head and left hand on 27 October 1998.
 3.The second appellant Toh Tian Choon (`Toh`), is Kee`s husband. He was charged with three counts of voluntarily causing hurt to the victim, contrary to s 323 read with s 73(1)(a) and s 73(2) of the Penal Code. The first count involved the squeezing of a bun into the victim`s mouth on 26 August 1998, the second count involved the squeezing of a chicken nugget into the victim`s mouth on 6 September 1998 and the third count involved the poking of his index finger against the victim`s forehead on 26 October 1998.
 4.The victim lodged a complaint after the above incidents occurred. On 5 November 1998, she agreed to withdraw the complaint on terms set out in a certificate of settlement (`the settlement`) witnessed by the Consul of the Philippines Embassy Mr Ernesto N Diano. The appellants complied with the terms of the settlement on the same day. The Philippines Embassy (`the Embassy`) subsequently wrote a letter dated 12 November 1998 to the police informing them that the victim and the appellants had reached an agreement to settle the case amicably and that the victim had agreed to drop her complaint. The letter stated that the Embassy had no objection to the settlement and requested the police to allow the case to be closed.
 5.On 31 December 1998, formal charges were brought against the appellants. On 12 February 1999, Sukumar & Teo, then the solicitors for the appellants, wrote to the Embassy seeking confirmation that the victim had in fact agreed to settlement. In a written reply dated 15 February 1999, the Embassy informed the solicitors that the victim would only accept the offer to settle if the appellants paid her an additional $3,500.
 6.The charges were heard before the district judge on 15 March 1999. Counsel for the appellants requested the court to endorse the terms of compensation set out in the settlement of 5 November 1998 and allow the charges to be compounded under s 199 of the CPC.
 7.
 Decision of the district judge 
 
The district judge held that there was inherent public interest involved in the case and withheld his consent to the composition.
 8.
 The appeal 
 
The appellants appealed against this decision of the district judge. They submitted firstly, that the consent of the court to composition is not required under s 199 of the CPC where the composition is made before any arrest or application for summons or warrant of arrest is made. Secondly, they argued that, even if the consent of the court is required, the court should have granted its consent in this instance.

 Preliminary objection of the respondents 
 
The Public Prosecutor raised a preliminary objection to the appeal. In a criminal matter, an appeal can only be lodged against a judgment, sentence or order of finality, that is, resulting in conviction, sentence or acquittal. This principle is equally true of appeals from the High Court to the Court of Appeal as well as from the Subordinate Court to the High Court; see 
Mohamed Razip v PP
 
[1987] SLR 142
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 84
 , 
Ang Cheng Hai & Ors v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 201
  and 
Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v PP
 (Unreported) . It was submitted by the Public Prosecutor that since the order of the district judge to withhold consent from the composition did not result in an acquittal or conviction, there was no order of finality against which an appeal could be lodged.
 10.In 
Provincial Govt, Central Provinces and Berar v Bipin Singh Choudhury
 
[1945] AIR 104
 it was held that an order giving consent to composition of an offence can be appealed against since the discharge on composition has the effect of an acquittal, although that decision was on the basis of s 417 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code (`Indian CPC`) which states that an appeal lies in a case of an acquittal and s 345(6) of the Indian CPC which states that the composition of an offence shall have the effect of an acquittal. Within the local context, the relevant decision is that of the High Court in 
PP v Norzian bin Bintat
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 462
 , where the Public Prosecutor brought an appeal against the decision of the district judge to consent to composition. In both these cases, consent for composition was granted by the court below and those orders were final as the acquittal brought a close to the proceedings. Where consent to composition is withheld however, such as in the present case, there is no acquittal and the trial continues. The question then is whether, in such a situation, the order to withhold consent to composition is an order of finality which can be appealed against.
 11.The definition of an `order of finality` was laid down by Wee Chong Jin CJ in 
 Mohamed Razip v PP 
 at 
[1987] SLR 142
, 144, 
[1988] 1 MLJ 84
, 85: 
... the jurisdiction of the [appellate court] is to hear appeals against orders of finality, ie those resulting in conviction and sentence, or acquittal.
 Mr Edwin Tay, counsel for the appellants, submitted that an order withholding consent from composition is an order of finality in that it could have effected an acquittal, bringing the proceedings to a close. In other words, the test of the finality of an order should be based not just on the operative effect of the order, but on its possible effect. Otherwise, there can be no appeal against an order to withhold consent to composition, when the effect of such an order, if wrong and reversed, is an acquittal. An argument along these lines was raised by counsel for the appellant in 
 Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v PP 
. The issue there was whether an order refusing a stay of proceedings was an order of finality which could be appealed against. The court rejected the appellant`s submission that the test of finality was the possible effect of the order. The operative effect of the order to refuse a stay of proceedings was to continue the hearing of the trial in the ordinary way by the court and the appellant was accordingly precluded from appealing against such an order at that stage of the proceedings.
 12.The difficulty of accepting the possible effect of an order as the test of finality can perhaps be most clearly seen from the example of an order that there is a case to answer. If the `possible effect` test was accepted, it would mean that every order that there is a case to answer could be appealed against, since such an order, if reversed, would mean that the proceedings would be brought to a close and the defendant acquitted on the basis that there was no case to answer. This would result in unfortunate consequences for the administration of criminal justice. Such orders are made everyday in all manner of criminal trials and the number of appeals which are bound to arise from such orders would effectively grind the criminal justice system to a halt.
 13.I was therefore of the view that the test of finality of an order, should be whether its operative effect is to result in a conviction, sentence or acquittal. On that basis, the district judge`s order to refuse composition was not an order of finality as its operative effect was to continue the trial, and was hence not appealable.
 14.Nevertheless, I found that this court had the power to deal with the matters raised by virtue of its power of revision conferred by s 268(1) of the CPC, which states that the High Court may in any case where the record of proceedings has come to its knowledge, in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by s 256 of the CPC.
 15.
 Whether consent is required 
 
The first submission of the appellants was that the consent of the court for composition is not required under s 199 of the CPC if the composition is made before any arrest or application for summons or warrant of arrest is made. Since the composition in the present case was made on 5 November 1998 and the formal charges made only on 31 December 1998, the district judge was wrong to have withheld his consent to the composition when his consent was not required.
 16.The appellant relied on a decision of this court in 
 PP v Norzian bin Bintat 
 where it was said in obiter at p 473 that: 
It is only when an arrest has been effected or when a summons or a warrant for arrest has been applied for that the consent of the court is required. It is possible to compound an offence before any arrest or application for a summons or warrant of arrest is made. In that case, no consent of the court is required. The composition is complete once agreement is arrived at, as was held in 
Dharichhan Singh v Emperor
 
[1939] AIR 141
. It would then be the duty of the magistrate to enter an acquittal, and there is no discretion in the matter at all. Nor may the victim withdraw consent to the composition.
 17.
Dharichhan Singh v Emperor
 
[1939] AIR 141
 was a decision of Manohar Lall J, who said at p 142 that: 
If the learned magistrate had known that in law a composition once arrived at between the parties is complete as soon as it is made, and that it has the effect of acquittal even though one of the parties later on resiles from the compromise, he would not have passed the order of 26 May. The case law on this point is reviewed in 33 CLJ 226, where the leading Calcutta and Madras cases on the point have been considered, and it was held in circumstances such as the present that the magistrate was in duty bound to order an acquittal on the filing of the compromise petition signed for both parties in court for an offence 
 for which no leave of the court was required
, and the complainant cannot by a subsequent withdrawal of the petition before any order is passed, insist upon the case being proceeded with. [Emphasis added.]
 Manohar Lall J`s statements were made in respect of what is now s 320(1) of the Indian CPC, which states: 
The offences punishable under the sections of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) specified in the first two columns of the Table next following may be compounded by the persons mentioned in the third column of that Table ...
 This is in contrast to s 320(2) of the Indian CPC, which specifies certain offences for which the permission of the court is essential and any agreement made between the parties before prosecution started is ineffective as a compromise: 
Kuchibhotla Venkatasubba Rao v Chandanmal & Anor
 
[1942] AIR 662
.
 18.The judgment in 
 Dharichhan Singh v Emperor 
 was based on a provision which is different from s 199(1) of the CPC, which states: 
The offences punishable under the Penal Code shown in the sixth column of Schedule A as being compoundable may be compounded by the person mentioned in that column provided that when an arrest has been effected or an application has been made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons the consent of a Magistrate or, if the offence is not triable by a Magistrate`s Court, of a District Judge, shall first be obtained.
 Unlike s 199 of the CPC, s 320 of the Indian CPC does not contain a proviso that the consent of the court is required when `an arrest has been effected or an application has been made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons`. The issue of consent in the Indian provision is not dealt with by reference to whether formal proceedings have been instituted. Instead, the distinction is between offences listed in s 320(1) for which no consent of court is required, and offences listed in s 320(2), for which consent is required. 
 Dharichhan Singh v Emperor 
 is therefore not relevant to the present issue of whether the consent of the court is required under s 199 of the CPC for a composition made before an arrest has been effected or an application made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons. The dicta in 
 PP v Norzian bin Bintat 
 that was made in reliance on 
 Dharichhan Singh v Emperor 
 should be regarded solely as obiter dictum.
 19.Section 199(1) of the CPC does not state that the consent of the court is not required if the composition is made before an arrest has been effected or an application made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons. Instead, on its proper construction, an offence listed in the sixth column of Schedule A is compoundable only with the consent of the court when an arrest has been effected or an application made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons. It does not matter that the composition was made before the arrest was effected. The point is that once an offence is considered grave enough for formal proceedings to be commenced, the offence can be compounded only if the court agrees to it.
 20.This reading of s 199(1) of the CPC is supported by the fact that offences such as causing grievous hurt by an act which endangers human life under s 338 of the Penal Code and assault or use of criminal force to a person with intent to outrage modesty under s 354 of the Penal Code are listed as compoundable under the sixth column of Schedule A. If the appellants` suggested reading of s 199(1) of the CPC is correct, it would mean that serious offences such as those under s 338 and s 354 of the Penal Code can be compounded without the consent of the court. Compositions are based on the public policy that, where the interests of the public are not vitally affected, such as in offences which are minor and largely private in nature, the injured party should be allowed to come to a settlement with the person against whom he complains. For offences such as those under s 338 or s 354 of the Penal Code which are potentially grave offences, it is difficult to conceive that Parliament would have regarded them as mere petty wrongs which do not affect the public interest and hence require no judicial sanction before composition is allowed. It is noteworthy that in India such offences are listed in s 320(2) of the Indian CPC. They are regarded as offences of greater gravity and are compoundable only with the consent of the court.
 21.
 Whether consent should have been given 
 
The next issue was whether the district judge erred in withholding his consent to the composition. Where an order involves a discretion of the court, the appellate court will not interfere with the exercise of the discretion unless it was exercised on demonstrably wrong principles or without any grounds, or if the judge had ignored some relevant provision of law; see 
Lim Seng Gin v R
 
[1956] MLJ 76
 and 
R v Lim Kian Soo
 
[1950] MLJ 181
 .
 22.The principles involved in the exercise of discretion for the granting of composition were discussed at length in 
 PP v Norzian bin Bintat 
 at pp 474-476. It was said that, where the public interest is involved, it is proper to withhold consent to composition. Where however the public interest does not figure strongly, and there is an absence of aggravating factors, the court should lean towards the granting of consent.
 23.In this case, the district judge withheld his discretionary consent to the composition on the basis that there was inherent public interest involved, having regard to the nature of the alleged offences, the circumstances under which they were committed and the relationship between the parties.
 24.The Public Prosecutor highlighted the May 1998 amendment to the Penal Code, whereby the maximum penalty for an offence under s 323 of the Penal Code committed by employers of domestic maids was enhanced to one and a half times the prescribed punishment by virtue of s 73(2) of the Penal Code. The amendment was the result of public concern over the increase in number of maid abuse cases reported to the police, from 105 in 1994 to 192 in 1997. It was recognised in Parliament that domestic maids are more vulnerable to abuse by employers and their immediate family members than any other categories of employees, and that abuse of foreign domestic maids can damage our international reputation and bilateral relations.
 25.The appellants acknowledged that there is a public interest in protecting domestic maids from their employers, but submitted that Parliament`s main concern in legislating for s 73(2) of the Penal Code was the prevention of bizarre and cruel acts of abuse, and not offences such as those of the present case which are allegedly minor. This narrow conception of the public concern over maid abuse is not borne out by the Parliamentary debates on the second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 1998. The mention of bizarre and cruel acts of abuse was made by Member of Parliament Mr Chng Hee Kok in reference to the type of abuses reported in the media. His point was that press reports of abuse of domestic maids had become fairly common over the years, and the type of abuses reported had become more bizarre and cruel with the abusers seemingly younger. Neither he nor any of the other Members of Parliament expressed the view that public concern was only over cases of bizarre and cruel acts of abuse.
 26.Indeed, it is clear from s 73(2) of the Penal Code that the concern is over maid abuse in general. The enhanced penalties apply to all situations of hurt, grievous hurt, wrongful confinement, assault or use of criminal force with intent to outrage modesty and insult of modesty. There is no qualification that the enhanced penalties only apply in situations of bizarre or cruel acts.
 27.In the circumstances, I was of the view that the district judge exercised his discretion correctly in deciding that his consent to composition should be withheld because of the public interest involved. There was therefore no basis for disturbing his decision.
 28.For the reasons given above, the appeal was dismissed.",1999-07-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
LP THEAN JA
 (delivering the judgment of the court):
 This is an appeal against the decision of a judge in chambers in which he allowed an appeal against the decision of the senior assistant registrar dismissing an application to strike out, inter alia, two paragraphs of the reply filed by the plaintiffs on the ground that they are irrelevant, frivolous and would prejudice or delay the fair trial of this action. The central issue in this appeal concerns the matters pleaded by the appellants in the reply in support of their plea of express malice alleged to have been entertained by the first three respondents.
 2.
 The events
The first, third, fourth and tenth appellants are advocates and solicitors practising in Singapore. The second appellant is a retired school principal. The fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth and eleventh appellants are education officers, and the seventh appellant is a computer operations officer. All the appellants were members of the organising committee of the 1995 Tamil Language Week that was held from 8 April to 15 April 1995.
 3.The third respondent is a political party in Singapore, the Workers` Party. The first and second respondents are members of the party. The party publishes anewsletter, 
 The Hammer 
, once every two months which is sold to the public. The second respondent is the editor and the fourth respondent the printer of 
 The Hammer 
 .
 4.In the issue of 
 The Hammer 
 published in August 1995, there appeared an article in Tamil about the 1995 Tamil Language Week (`the article`) which was written by the first respondent. The appellants complained that certain passages of the article were, in their ordinary and natural meaning, defamatory of them. On 26 December 1995, the appellants commenced the present action against all the respondents claiming damages for libel. They claim against the first respondent as the author, the second respondent as the editor, the third respondent as the publisher and the fourth respondent as the printer of the article, as all of them participated in the publication of the article.
 5.In their statement of claim (as subsequently amended), the appellants pleaded, inter alia, the allegedly defamatory passages of the article in Tamil and an English translation thereof, which is as follows:
In the midst of a gathering of vultures determined to ensure that the number of intellectuals do not increase, we are proud to see the sacrificial white doves of the 25 Tamil Organizations mingling in a national mainstream called the Tamil Language Week ...
 
Although this Tamil Language Week is a drama enacted for written judgment by the government ...
 
Forty years have passed since Tamil received official recognition according to the Constitution in 1954. Despite that why have the 25 organizations remained tight-lipped and silent instead of proposing a resolution to question as to why Tamil has not been offered as a subject of study in the National University of Singapore. Is this your service to Tamil? You are cheating the Tamils living in Singapore generation after generation. Is this just? The Tamil Language Week you organized also resulted like what Bharathiyar said, `You are a warrior at words (no action).` Besides you gathering and dispersing, what have you achieved? ...
 
The organisers have told us that many fear that the Tamil language would die in the future. For that, there is no necessity for us to obtain the assurance of ministers who are in power today and who would disappear tomorrow. We are creators of history for achievements! Let us realise and so act that so long as there is one Tamilian, Tamil will not die in Singapore.
 
We learn that faces which have not been seen amongst Tamilians so far have, with an intention to seek political gains, taken on responsibilities in the Tamil Language Week. If that were true, we ask them not to prostitute nakedly and wander for position, in the name of Tamil.
 6.The appellants averred that the above passages in the article referred to them and that in their ordinary and natural meaning were understood to mean that: a. the plaintiffs and each of them are stooges of the government in allowing themselves to be regarded as the sacrificial white doves;
 b. the plaintiffs organised the Tamil Language Week in order to obtain and curry favour with the government;
 c. the plaintiffs are incompetent, inactive and ineffective in promoting the Tamil language and they are cheats and liars in not fulfilling their duties in the specific cause of promoting the Tamil language;
 d. the plaintiffs are nakedly prostituting themselves in order to seek political gain/office rather than serve the cause of the Tamil language.
 Alternatively, the appellants pleaded that the words complained of in their context bore the above defamatory meanings by way of innuendo.
 7.The first, second and third respondents (`the three respondents`) filed a joint defence. They denied that the article or any part thereof referred to or were capable of referring to the appellants. They also denied that the article or any part thereof in the natural and ordinary meaning bore or was capable of bearing the meanings as alleged by the appellants. In the alternative, the respondents pleaded that the words complained of were a fair comment on a matter of public interest, and particulars of the fair comment were given.
 8.In response, the appellants filed a reply, in which they pleaded in para 3 that the three respondents were actuated by express malice when they published the article, and they (the appellants) set out a lengthy list of particulars, as they were required to do under O 78 r 3(3) of the Rules of Supreme Court then in force (now O 78 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court 1996). The appellants also pleaded in para 4 six sub-paragraphs of additional facts or matters in support of the claim for aggravated damages.
 9.Following this, the three respondents applied by Summons-in-Chamber No 1602 of 1996 to strike out the statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, and, failing that, to strike out paras 3 and 4 of the reply as being irrelevant, frivolous and tending to prejudice or delay a fair trial of the action. The application was heard before a senior assistant registrar, who dismissed it. The respondents appealed to a judge in chambers.
 10.The learned judge who heard the appeal refused the application to strike out the statement of claim; but he allowed the application to strike out paras 3 and 4 of the reply. The appellants requested for a hearing of further arguments, and accordingly further arguments were heard. During that hearing, the appellants conceded that para 4 was inept and ought to be sruck out; their further arguments were directed against the application to strike out para 3. The learned judge affirmed his earlier decision and subsequently gave his grounds of judgment (reported in 
[1997] 1 SLR 322
).
 11.The learned judge in [para ] 18 of the judgment concluded thus:
I reviewed the reply in the light of the rules of pleading and statements of law outlined above. I found para 3 to be an utterly confused mix of indiscriminatory allegations against all the defendants which will embarrass each of the defendants in one way or another and prejudice the conduct of the defence of each defendant. It sets out at great length allegations of defamatory statements as regards the government and People`s Action Party members of Parliament without relating them to the defamation alleged by the plaintiffs, who do not claim to be members of the government or the People`s Action Party. Further, matters set out do not say who was actuated by malice and the causal connection between the allegation and the defendant. The allegations are too sweeping and remote, rendering impossible a fair trial on the issue of malice. Counsel for plaintiffs during arguments was prepared to concede para 3(e) as being remote but in my view striking out that paragraph alone does not cure the other defects in the reply. Paragraph 3(f) is a mere re-affirmation of what had been stated in the statement of claim which is not a matter for reply. In the circumstances I strike out paras 3 and 4 of the reply on the ground that they are abhorrent to substantive as well as formal rules of pleading.
 Against the decision of the learned judge the appellants have now appealed.
 12.
 The appeal
One of the defences raised by the respondents is fair comment on a matter of public interest. This defence can be defeated by proof by the appellants - and the burden is on them - that in publishing the article the respondents were actuated by express or actual malice. Malice in the law of defamation is extremely broad. It is not confined to ill-will or spite entertained by the respondents against the appellants; it means also any improper motive on the part of the respondents in publishing the article.
 13.
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed) in para 765 contains the following summary:
`
 Indirect motive
.` Actual malice does not necessarily mean personal spite or ill will. `Malice in the actual sense may exist even though there be no spite or desire for vengeance in the ordinary sense.` `Any 
 indirect motive
 other than a sense of duty is what the law calls malice.` `Malice means making use of the occasion for some 
 indirect purpose
.` ...
 A similar passage is also found in 
 Duncan and Neill on Defamation 
(2nd Ed) in para 17.18:
Express malice includes any indirect or improper motive. Accordingly any evidence would be relevant on the issue of malice if it tended to show that the defendant made the publication not for the purpose for which the qualified privilege existed nor in the exercise of his right to comment on the matter of public interests but, for example, in order to injure the plaintiff or some third party.
 14.As stated in the passage just quoted, the term malice even includes a motive to injure a third party. 
 Gatley 
 explained the basis for such extended meaning in para 767 which is as follows:
 Injury to a third party
. However, since it is not the desire to injure, but the misuse of the occasion which takes away the privilege it is not essential that the defendant should be actuated by malice towards the plaintiff in the ordinary sense. If the defendant did not use the occasion for the purpose for which the privilege is granted, but to gratify his animosity against a 
 third
 person, and in so doing libelled the plaintiff, the defence of privilege will fail. So under a plea of fair comment, if the real object of the defendant was not to fulfil his duty as critic, but to gratify his spite or ill will against, eg the plaintiff`s father, the defence will fail.
 15.
 Gatley 
 cited the decision of the Victoria Supreme Court case of 
Stewart v McKinley
 
[1885] 11 VLR 802
 in support of the proposition. In that case, the plaintiff was a member of an expedition that was sent by a Melbourne newspaper, the Age, to explore the island of New Guinea. A rival newspaper, the 
 Melbourne Daily Telegraph 
, published an article giving a purported account of certain events which took place in the course of that expedition and also containing a critical commentary on that account. The plaintiff took the view that the article waslibellous of him and brought an action against the proprietors of the 
 Melbourne Daily Telegraph 
 newspaper for damages for libel. The defendants pleaded fair comment. At the trial, the judge gave a direction to the jury to the effect that though the writer appeared to have written the article to gratify his animosity against a third party, such malice would not affect his defence of fair comment inasmuch as the malice required to destroy the defence of fair comment must be one against the plaintiff and there was no evidence of such malice against the plaintiff.
 16.On appeal, it was held, inter alia, that this direction of the learned judge was erroneous. Giving the judgment of the Full Court, Williams J said at pp 807- 808 of the report:
The question we have to consider is whether the malice necessary to destroy the privilege is limited to actual malice against the person complaining (the plaintiff in the action), or whether, if the writer does not write for the purpose for which the privilege is granted to him, but to gratify his spleen against a third person, and in so doing drags in and libels the party complaining, the privilege any longer subsists for the protection of the writer. In the recent case of 
Clark v Molyneux
 
[1878] 3 QBD 237
 on appeal, Bramwell LJ, in discussing what is evidence of malice in actions where the defence of privileged occasion is set up, uses these words:
 
`The jury need not ascertain what the wrong motive was if they can say that there was a wrong motive; and if the defendant was actuated by some other motive than that which alone would excuse him, the jury may find for the plaintiff.`
 
And Brett, LJ, in the same case expresses himself upon the same point as follows:
 
`If the occasion is privileged it is so for some reason, and the defendant is only entitled to the protection of the privilege if he uses the occasion for that reason. He is not entitled to the protection if he uses the occasion for some indirect and wrong motive. If he uses the occasion to gratify his anger or his malice, he uses the occasion not for the reason which makes the occasion privileged, but for an indirect and wrong motive. If it be proved that, out of anger, or for some other wrong motive, the defendant has stated as true that which he does not know to be true; and he has stated it whether it is true or not, recklessly, by reason of his anger or other motive, the jury may infer that he used the occasion, not for the reason which justifies it, but for the gratification of his anger or other indirect motive.`
 
We think that this to be a clear, forcible, and satisfactory exposition of the law upon this point ...
 
If, then, the judgments which we have referred to in 
 Clark v Molyneux
 be a correct exposition of the law, it follows logically that if a writer writes an article upon a matter of public interest, not for the purpose of benefitting the public, but to gratify his personal malice against A.B., and, in the course of so writing, libels C.D., C.D. upon proof of that purpose would be entitled to maintain an action against the writer, who has lost the shelter of privilege, because he has used the occasion for a purpose to which there attaches no privilege.
 17.On the same point are two further authorities which are of assistance. The first is an old Australian decision that predates 
 Stewart v McKinley 
. It is a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 
 Phillpots and wife v Tyrell, Lord Bishop of Newcastle 
 (1875) 13 SCR (NSW) 229. Briefly, the relevant facts were these. The Bishop of Newcastle wrote a letter to one ReverendThackeray, accusing him of having had illicit sexual intercourse with a Mrs Phillpots of West Maitland. Reverend Thackeray showed the letter to Mr and Mrs Phillpots, who then brought an action for libel against the Bishop. The defence raised by the Bishop was one of qualified privilege. To defeat this defence, the Phillpots pleaded that the Bishop was actuated by express malice. In support of the plea of express malice, the Phillpots sought to admit in evidence some previous correspondence between the Bishop and Reverend Thackeray to show that the Bishop harboured malice towards Thackeray, when he published the libel of the plaintiffs. Counsel for the Bishop resisted the admission of this evidence on the ground that it was irrelevant to the question of whether the Bishop harboured malice against Mrs Phillpots. The judge at first instance admitted the evidence. On appeal his decision was upheld. Martin CJ said, at p 241:
It is further urged, however, that proof of malice against Mr Thackeray was no proof of malice against Mrs Phillpots. I am unable to take that view. It was the right to communicate with Mr Thackeray the charge against him, which made the occasion privileged so far as Mrs Phillpots was concerned, and if the charge so privileged was made from an improper motive, and therefore maliciously, the privilege is gone entirely, and the Bishop is at once deprived of its protection. For that reason I think, therefore, the evidence tending to show a wrong motive on the Bishop`s part as against Mr Thackeray was rightly admitted to prove express malice or wrong motive as against him, and that such malice or wrong motive was sufficient to support this action by Mrs Phillpots and her husband.
 This approach is similar to the one adopted in 
 Stewart v McKinley 
 in respect of the proof of express malice to defeat the defence of fair comment.
 18.The second authority is the Ontario Supreme Court decision in 
C v D
 
[1925] 1 DLR 734
. In that case, the plaintiff, C, was a young woman who brought an action against a doctor, D, for a slander alleged to have been published by D to C`s father and employer that C was suffering from a venereal disease. D published the slander on an occasion of qualified privilege. C alleged that D was actuated by express malice that destroyed the defence of qualified privilege. It was alleged, inter alia, that D bore ill-will and, hence, malice against C`s father when he published the slander of C, and some evidence was adduced to this effect. Riddell J on the evidence before him did not accept this allegation. In the course of his judgment, he said, at pp 739-740:
If the occasion be one of qualified privilege, the plaintiff must, in order to succeed, prove that the defendant was not using the occasion honestly for the purpose for which the law gave it to him, but was actuated by some indirect or ulterior motive, eg malice in the popular acceptance of the term ... It is not necessary that the malice proved should be malice against the plaintiff - if the publication be made to gratify the defendant`s malice against a third person, eg the father of the plaintiff, the defence of privilege fails: 
 Stewart v McKinley
 (1885) 11 Vict. LR 802 ...
 
What are relied upon to prove malice are: (1) want of examination of the plaintiff by the defendant to establish that she was infected with venereal disease; (2) conduct indicating ill-will against the father.
 
As to the latter, I do not believe the father`s evidence and do believe that of the defendant - there were no expressions of ill-will and there was in fact no ill-will by the defendant against B.C. There is and can be no pretence of ill-will against either the father or the plaintiff - she had been the defendant`s Sunday school scholar, and he had a regard for her - certainly no ill-will.
 19.A more recent authority on the same point is a pronouncement from Hunt J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia in 
Barbaro v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd
 
[1985] 1 NSWLR 30
. The facts in that case are not relevant for our purpose, but Hunt J in his judgment made the following observation obiter on express malice, at pp 50-51:
If the plaintiff shows 
 either
 that the defendant has used the occasion to publish the matter complained of for a purpose other than that for which the privilege is given (which is usually described as an indirect or an improper or a foreign motive) 
 or
 that the defendant did not have an honest belief in the truth of what he published, the defence of qualified privilege is defeated. Express malice is the term of art which is used to describe what the plaintiff must prove to defeat the defence of qualified privilege. In some of the older authorities, an absence of honest belief on the part of the defendant is treated merely as some evidence of an indirect motive which alone is said to constitute express malice, but the better view, in my opinion, is to treat the two as different kinds of malice. A belief in the truth of what was published will not be sufficient to save the defence of qualified privilege if the defendant nevertheless misused the occasion for a purpose other than that for which the privilege is given - 
 for example, if he has published the matter complained of in order to injure the plaintiff or some other person, or to vent his spite or ill-will towards him, or to obtain some private advantage unconnected with the privileged occasion upon which he made the publication
. That is the way in which the law has been expressed by the House of Lords in 
 Horrocks v Lowe
 (at 149-151). [Emphasis is ours.]
 20.On the authorities which we have considered, in a defamation action the plaintiff in meeting the defence of fair comment is entitled to adduce evidence to show that the defendant at the time of the publication of the alleged defamatory words was actuated by his desire or motive to gratify his animosity against a third party. The question is whether in this case, the matters pleaded in para 3 of the reply are relevant for this or other purpose connected with their averment of express malice on the part of the respondents.
 21.We now turn to examine the particulars in para 3 of the reply which are set out in seven sub-paras (a)-(g). We shall consider them seriatim. Sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) may conveniently be dealt with together, and they are as follows:
(a) The third defendants are an opposition political party who hold one seat in Parliament. The second defendant is the Secretary-General of the third defendants and the first defendant is a member of the third defendants. 
(b) The said article was a false and baseless attack on the present government`s policies relating to the Tamil language. 
(c) The first, second and third defendants have admitted that the said article was a false and baseless attack on various members of the present government. In an apology published in English and Tamil in The Straits Times and the Tamil Murasu on 23 November 1995, respectively, the first, second and third defendants unreservedly withdrew all the false and baseless allegations made in the said article.
 22.These three sub-paragraphs are intended by the appellants to demonstrate that the three respondents entertained malice against a third party or parties at the time the article was published. Sub-paragraph (a) describes the relationship between the three respondents themselves. The third respondent is an opposition political party having one seat in Parliament; the first respondent is a member and the second respondent, the secretary-general of the party. In the same vein, the articlealleged to be defamatory of the appellants was published in 
 The Hammer 
, which is the political organ of the third respondent and of which the third respondent is the publisher. These matters form the background against which the allegations in sub-paras (b) and (c) are made. These two sub-paragraphs allege that the article was `a false and baseless attack on the present government`s policies relating to the Tamil language` and that the three respondents had admitted that that was so in their apology and unreserved withdrawal of `all the false and baseless allegations` in the article. On the basis of these matters as pleaded the appellants would be entitled at the trial to ask the court to infer that in publishing the article the three respondents were motivated by a political agenda and that they intended to use the article to gratify their animosity towards the government or certain members of the government, and there was therefore express malice entertained by these respondents when they published the article.
 23.These sub-paragraphs are therefore directed towards showing that in publishing the article the respondents were motivated by a desire or motive to attack the government or various members of the government on the policy of Tamil language. On the authorities we have considered, if they succeed in doing so, the respondents` defence of fair comment will be defeated. Whether or not the appellants would succeed depends on the evidence adduced at the trial, and the burden rests on them. It may well be that these matters relied upon do not provide really a strong ground to support a finding of any improper motive on the part of the respondents as alleged. In particular, having regard to the fact that the respondents had, at an early stage, tendered an apology and withdrawn unreservedly the `false and baseless attack` against various members of the government, one would have thought the respondents would have probably disproved or negatived any indication of such improper motive. But that is a matter best left to the trial judge to decide. At this stage, the appellants are entitled to plead the matters set out in sub-paras (a), (b) and (c) on which they rely to establish an improper motive on the part of the respondents.
 24.Next, we turn to sub-para (d) which states:
(d) Notwithstanding the first, second and third defendants` admission that the said article was false and baseless, the first, second and third defendants refused to apologise to the plaintiffs even though the said article had viciously attacked the plaintiffs as alleged in paras 6 and 6A of the amended statement of claim;
 It is established law that a refusal to apologise per se cannot constitute evidence of express malice: 
Broadway Approvals Ltd v Odhams Press Ltd (No 2)
 
[1965] 1 WLR 805
 at pp 814, 824H; 
Horrocks v Lowe
 
[1975] AC 135
 at p 152. Counsel for the appellants, while accepting that this was clearly the law, argued that the respondents` refusal to apologise to the appellants, in the face of their apology to certain members of the government that the article contained allegations which were `false and baseless`, would constitute evidence of express malice; it is tantamount to evidence of the respondents` disregard of the truth when they published the article.
 25.We are not persuaded by this argument. First, if the respondents succeed in their defence of fair comment, their failure to apologise or retract the passages alleged to be defamatory of the appellants provides little indication of malice (per Sellers LJ in 
 Broadway Approvals Ltd v Odhams Press Ltd (No 2) 
 at p 814). Secondly, it is entirely unclear of what relevance the respondents` apology to a third party has to their refusal to apologise to the appellants. We thus find ourselves in agreement with the learned judge`s decision to strike out this sub-para (d).
 26.We now come to the lengthy sub-para (e) of the reply which is as follows:
(e) In the premises, the first, second and third defendants published or caused the said article to be published knowing it was false and/or recklessly not caring whether it was true or false for the purpose of putting the present government in a bad light and with a view of obtaining a political advantage. The plaintiffs will rely, inter alia, on the following facts and matters: 
i On or about 18 December 1976, at an election rally of the third defendants held at Fullerton Square, the second defendant gave a speech in which he inferred that the then Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Secretary-General of the PAP, procured the grant of favours to Messrs Lee & Lee (of which his wife was a senior partner) and to members of his family and that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had been guilty of nepotism and corruption. 
ii On or about 26 August 1988, at an election rally of the third defendants at the Bedok Town Centre carpark, the second defendant gave a speech in which he made reference to the suicide of Mr Teh Cheang Wan, the then Minister for National Development. The third defendant also implied that Mr Lee Kuan Yew was unfit for the office of Prime Minister because he had advised Mr Teh Cheang Wan to commit suicide in order to avoid investigations into his conduct. The third defendant further implied that Mr Lee Kuan Yew was guilty of criminal misconduct because he had abetted Mr Teh Cheang Wan`s suicide; 
iii In the No 1 of 1994 issue of 
 The Hammer 
, the first defendant wrote an article in Tamil in which he suggested that the PAP and the Tamil ministers and members of Parliament had not done anything to advance the Tamil language in Singapore; and 
iv In the No 1 of 1994 issue of 
 The Hammer 
, the first defendant wrote an article in the Tamil language which was headed `Pay Rise For The Ministers Is Unjust` in which he implied that the ministers in Singapore did not deserve a pay rise.
 27.Looking at the entire sub-paragraph, we find that it is quite self-evident that the particulars pleaded there are wholly irrelevant to the issue of whether the respondents were actuated by express malice at the time when they published the allegedly libellous passages concerning the appellants. The learned judge said that counsel for the appellants was prepared to concede that the particulars pleaded at sub-para (e)(i) and (ii) were too remote to be possibly relevant. We are therefore somewhat surprised that before us counsel should seek to re-argue a point which he had earlier conceded. Be that as it may, in our view, the incidents pleaded at sub-para (e)(i) and (ii) do not appear to have any connection or relevance with the present alleged libel of the appellants. The incidents, by themselves, cannot possibly be evidence that the respondents were actuated by express malice when they published the alleged libel.
 28.The same considerations would apply to sub-para (e)(iii) and (iv). The fact that the first respondent had, in the past, criticised the government and its policies can have no bearing on the present defamation suit. These particulars are far tooremote to be relevant to the question of whether the respondents were actuated by express malice in relation to the alleged libel of the appellants. The learned judge was right to strike out the whole of this lengthy sub-paragraph.
 29.The final two sub-paragraphs may be conveniently dealt with together. They state:
(f) The words complained of also constituted a gravely defamatory and highly damaging attack on the integrity and competence of the plaintiffs; and 
(g) The plaintiffs will rely on the tone and prominence given to the article.
 The learned judge pointed out that sub-para (f) was merely a repetition of what had already been pleaded in the amended statement of claim. It was clearly not a matter for the reply and was quite irrelevant to the issue of express malice. However, counsel for the appellants argued that what is meant by sub-para (f) is that the words alleged to be defamatory are themselves evidence of express malice. This is because the court is entitled to look at the defamatory article itself and examine the type and kind of language used to determine whether the respondents were actuated by express malice. It is therefore submitted that the appellants are entitled to rely on the actual words constituting the libel as evidence of the respondents` express malice.
 30.We think that there is some merit in this submission. There is support for this in 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed, 1981) at para 1339 which states:
But malice is not only provable by extrinsic evidence: it may be intrinsic, that is, to be `inferred from the terms of the alleged libel itself.` `It may be that the language used in a libel, though under other circumstances justifiable, may be too violent for the occasion and circumstances ... as to form strong evidence of malice, ... and that an inference of actual malice may be drawn from its use.` The plaintiff has the right to require that the libel itself shall be submitted to the jury that they may judge whether there is malice on the face of it ...
 31.We would therefore allow sub-para (f) to stand. Similarly, sub-para (g) may stand in support of express malice, although it repeats in a different form what is said in sub-para (f). As pointed out by counsel for the appellants, sub-para (g) is a standard averment in replies alleging express malice of a defendant raising fair comment or qualified privilege as a defence: see 
 Bullen and Leake and Jacob`s Precedents of Pleadings 
(13th Ed, 1990) Form 1331 at pp 1481-1482.
 32.Before we conclude, we should clarify a point of law raised by the learned judge. In the course of his judgment, the learned judge referred to para 789 of 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed, 1981) which is as follows:
 Malice and joint tortfeasors: fair comment
. Where a defence of fair comment is relied on and malice in the maker of the comment is proved, a person who has participated in the publication but has not himself composed the comment and is not himself malicious is probably not entitled to rely on the defence. `If a publication has been held not to be a fair comment, then all concerned in publishing it have published an unfair comment and no questions of individual malice or bona fides can arise.` Per Davies LJ in 
Egger v Chelmsford
 
[1965] 1 QB 248
 at p 269. If the malice is the malice of a servant or agent employed to compose the comment, the innocent principal will, of course, be liable on the ordinary principles of 
 respondeat superior
.
 The learned judge then said at [para ] 15 and 16:
The use of the word `probably` means that the law is not settled for Lord Denning MR in 
Egger v Chelmsford
 
[1965] 1 QB 248
 at p 265: `If the plaintiff seeks to rely on malice to aggravate damages, or to rebut a defence of qualified privilege, or to cause a comment, otherwise fair, to become unfair, then he must prove malice against each person whom he charges with it. A defendant is only affected by express malice if he himself was actuated by it: or if his servant or agent concerned in the publication was actuated by malice in the course of his employment.` Hopefully it will be argued and settled in this case. At least as a tentative proposition the law is that where fair comment is raised as a defence it is necessary for the plaintiffs to allege whether the 
 maker
 of the comment was actuated by malice. As the adverse state of mind of the maker, that is the writer, of the comment is what constitutes malice it is malice on his part that is material and not the publishers.
 
... In any event in a case where the publisher of the libel does not understand the contents of the comment, because he does not understand the language in which it is written, it is farfetched to contend that an improper motive could be imputed to him.
 32.We find, with respect, that the first sentence of 
 Gatley 
 in para 789 is not correct. In our opinion, where two or more persons have participated in the publication of a defamatory article and all of them are sued and they rely on the defence of fair comment or qualified privilege, the plaintiff, in order to defeat the defence and succeed in his claim against 
 each and every 
 defendant must prove express malice on the part of 
 each 
 of the defendants. If he fails to show that any one of them was actuated by express malice, then the defence of 
 that defendant 
 will succeed and he will not be liable; as for the other defendants, if the plaintiff succeeds in showing express malice on their part, then in the absence of any other defence succeeding, they will be liable. Hence, it is not correct to say that the plaintiff must prove that 
 all 
 the defendants were actuated by express malice before he can succeed in his claim 
 against any one of them 
. That would be tantamount to saying that all the defendants will escape liability if any one of them is innocent of express malice.
 33.What we have said above has been decided in 
Egger v Viscount Chelmsford & Ors
 
[1965] 1 QB 248
. In that case, the plaintiff brought an action against the assistant-secretary and ten members of a sub-committee of a kennel club for libel contained in a letter written by the secretary on the instructions of the sub-committee to certain person who had an interest to receive it. The defendants pleaded the defence of qualified privilege. The plaintiff by her reply alleged express malice on the part of the defendants as ousting the privilege. At the trial, the jury disagreed and on a re-trial the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff but found that the secretary and three of the committee members were not actuated by malice in publishing the letter. The Court of Appeal held that the secretary and the three committee members who were not actuated by malice were not liable to the plaintiff. Lord Denning MR in his judgment said, at pp 264-265:
I cannot help but think the root of all the trouble is the tacit assumption that if one of the persons concerned in a joint publication is a tortfeasor, then all are joint tortfeasors. They must therefore stand or fall together. So much so that the defence of one is the defence of all: and the malice of one is the malice of all. I think this assumption rests on a fallacy. In point of law, no tortfeasors can truly be described as 
 joint
 tortfeasors. They are always 
 several
 tortfeasors as well. In any joint tort, the party injured has his choiceof whom to sue. He can sue all of them together or any or more of them separately. This has been the law for centuries. It is well stated in Serjeant Williams` celebrated notes to Saunders` Reports (1845 Ed) of 
 Cabell v Vaughan
: `If several persons jointly commit a tort, the plaintiff has his election to sue all of any number of the parties; because a 
 tort
 is in its nature the separate act of each individual.` Therein lies the gist of the matter. Even in a joint tort, the tort is the separate act of each individual. Each is severally answerable for it: and, being severally answerable, each is severally entitled to his own defence. If he is himself innocent of malice, he is entitled to the benefit of it. He is not to be dragged down with the guilty. ... It is a mistake to suppose that, on a joint publication, the malice of one defendant infects his co-defendant. Each defendant is answerable severally, as well as jointly for the joint publication: and each is entitled to his several defence, whether he be sued jointly or separately from the others. If the plaintiff seeks to rely on malice to aggravate damages, or to rebut a defence of qualified privilege, or to cause a comment, otherwise fair, to become unfair, then he must prove malice against each person whom he charges with it. A defendant is only affected by express malice if he himself was actuated by it: or if his servant or agent concerned in the publication was actuated by malice in the course of employment.

Lee Kuan Yew v Derek Gwyn Davies & Ors
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 390
  at p 415; 
[1989] SLR 1063
 at p 1107.
 34.We now revert to the judgment below. The learned judge in that part of the judgment just quoted seemed to suggest that where fair comment is a defence in a defamation action, it is necessary for the plaintiff to allege whether the maker, ie the writer, of the comment was actuated by malice on the ground that it is the writer`s state of mind `is what constitutes malice` and `it is malice on his part that is material`. That, with respect, is not quite correct. Where the writer, editor and publisher of an article are sued for defamation in respect of that article and the defence of fair comment is raised by all three of them, as in the instant case, the plaintiff in order to defeat the defence of each of them must allege and prove that each of them was actuated by express malice. If the plaintiff fails to do so as against any one of them, say the publisher, then the latter`s defence succeeds and only the writer and editor are liable. In our view, it is not correct to say that the writer of the libel must be shown to have acted with express malice before the plaintiff can succeed against the other defendants, as in this case, the editor and publisher. If no express malice on the part of the writer is proved, then his defence succeeds and he would not be liable, and judgment may be entered against the rest of the defendants who have been proved to have been actuated by malice.
 35.The plaintiffs here in this case have pleaded that all the three defendants were actuated by express malice and they seek to rely on the matters stated in sub-paras (a) to (g) of para 3 of the reply. In our judgment, they are entitled to plead the matters in sub-paras (a), (b), (c), (f) and (g) in support of their plea of express malice on the part of the respondents; but sub-paras (d) and (e) are wholly irrelevant and, as the learned judge held, ought to be struck out.
 36.
 Conclusion
For the reasons we have given, this appeal is allowed in part. We vary the order below by reinstating sub-paras (a), (b), (c), (f) and (g) of para 3 of the reply. The appellants have succeeded partially in this appeal. In the circumstances, a fair order as to costs will be that the respondents pay half the costs of the appeal. Weso order. The order below as to costs remain undisturbed. The deposit in court as security for costs is to be refunded to the appellants.",1997-05-15 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

This was an application by Shamm bin Sulong for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus. He is presently being detained pursuant to the minister`s order under s 30 of the Criminal Law (Temporary) Provisions Act (Cap 67) (the Act).
It was not disputed that the applicant was arrested by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) on 14 March 1996 at 10.30pm. He was taken to the CNB headquarters at Outram Road. A detention report under s 44 of the Act was put up. The first part of this report was signed by one Chew Woon Hock stating that the applicant was arrested at 1230 hours on 15 March 1996 along Outram Road and the reasons for his arrest were that he was believed to have been `associating with activities of a criminal (drug trafficking) nature and that he was a heroin trafficker operating in the vicinity of Eunos Crescent`. The second part of the report was signed by ASP Teo Cheow Beng and dated 15 March 1996, at 1601 hours. ASP Teo authorised the detention of the applicant for a period of 48 hours expiring on 17 March 1996 at 1230 hours. The third part of the report was signed by Lim Kwang Meng, the Assistant Director, Specialised Crime Division of the Criminal Investigation Department and was also dated 15 March 1996 at 1607 hours. His report stated, `I am satisfied that the necessary enquiries cannot be completed within a period of 48 hours, and I hereby authorise the detention of the said Shamm bin Sulong for a further period of 14 days expiring at 1230 hours on 31 March 1996`.
On 30 March 1996 the Minister for Home Affairs directed that the applicant be detained for a period of 12 months from that date. The order was made pursuant to s 30 of the Act. Section 30 provides as follows: 
 
Whenever the Minister is satisfied with respect to any person, whether the person is at large or in custody, that the person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, the Minister may with the consent of the Public Prosecutor -
 
 
 
(a) if he is satisfied that it is necessary that the person be detained in the interests of public safety, peace and good order, by order under his hand direct that the person be detained for any period not exceeding one year from the date of the order; or
 
 
 
(b) if he is satisfied that it is necessary that the person be subject to the supervision of the police, by order direct that the person be subject to the supervision of the police for any period not exceeding 3 years from the date of the order.
 
 
 
Mr Raman, counsel for the applicant, does not challenge the order of the minister, but submitted that a writ of habeas corpus ought to issue on the grounds that the arrest of the applicant on 14 March 1996 was not in compliance with the provisions of the Act, and that there were no reasonable grounds for his arrest.
First, he argued that the arrest and detention were illegal because s 44 of the Act was not complied with. Section 44 states that:
 
 
(1) Any police officer may without warrant arrest and detain pending enquiries any person in respect of whom he has reason to believe there are grounds which would justify the detention of the person under section 30. 
 
(2) No person shall be detained under this section for a period exceeding 24 hours except with the authority of a police officer of or above the rank of assistant superintendent or for a period of 48 hours in all: 
 
Provided that if an officer of or above the rank of superintendent of police is satisfied that the necessary enquiries cannot be completed within the period of 48 hours he may authorise the further detention of the person for an additional period not exceeding 14 days and shall on giving such authorisation forthwith report the circumstances to the Commissioner of Police. 
 
(3) Any person detained under the powers conferred by this section shall be deemed to be in lawful custody and may be detained in any prison, or in any police station or in any other similar place authorised generally or specially by the Minister.
  
 
 
He argued that s 44 provides a staged extension of a detainee`s custody under the Act. A person may be detained for up to 24 hours and then up to 48 hours if authorisation is obtained from an officer of no less than the rank of assistant superintendent of police. If investigations cannot be completed within those 48 hours a superintendent of police may authorise the detention for a further period of 14 days. In this case, Mr Raman argued that the 48 hours and 14 days extensions were signed on 15 March 1996 even before the expiration of 24 hours. This was, in his submission, a breach of the procedure laid down in s 44. The main thrust of his argument was, however, that the person signing the authorisation for the 14-day further detention was signed by a person who was not of the rank of superintendent. That person, Mr Lim Kwang Meng, held the appointment of Assistant Director Specialised Crime, CID but was of the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police.
Mr Raman further argued that for some 16 days from the time of his arrest he was not informed of the grounds of his arrest. He submitted that this was a breach of art 9(3) of the Constitution which provides that a person arrested shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest. This particular argument should perhaps be considered with the applicant`s own affidavit at para 2(f) where he stated that: 
 
At the CNB HQ, I was taken to a room where I was questioned at length about my friends 
 and whether I was a drug pusher in the Eunos area
`. (My emphasis.)
 
 
 
Hence, even from his own affidavit it appears that he knew the reason for his arrest and detention. I make this observation in passing because an allegation of a breach of the fundamental liberties conferred by the Constitution should not be ignored. However, for reasons set out below it is unnecessary and inappropriate for me to make any findings of fact in the present proceedings.
Counsel relied on 
 Koh Yoke Koon v Minister for Home Affairs, Malaysia 
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 45
  in support of his argument that the prior illegality vitiated the current detention order. In that case, the applicant Koh Yoke Koon was arrested and detained under s 3(3) of the Malaysian Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance and subsequently under an order by the minister under s 4 of that Ordinance. The applicant challenged the validity of the detention order of the minister. The maximum period of detention under s 3(3) was 60 days but the applicant was detained for more than 60 days prior to the minister`s order.
The issue was, whether the minister exceeded his powers in ordering the continued detention of the applicant in the light of the illegality of the prior detention.
Edgar Joseph Jr J held that (at p 49): 
 
In the particular circumstances of the present case and, for the reasons stated, I am satisfied that the detention of the applicant under s 4(1) was not procured by steps `all of which were entirely regular` nor was I satisfied that `every step in the process which led to such detention was followed with extreme regularity` and therefore the court should not allow the imprisonment to continue.
 
 
 
The learned judge then went on to say, 
 
I would add that to hold to the contrary would, in effect, mean that the minister has the power to continue the detention of one who is being illegally detained. I cannot conceive that Parliament could have intended to confer upon the minister such a draconian power in the absence of explicit statutory provision.
 
 
 
He continued: 
 
It is true that a perusal of s 4(1) shows that the Minister is empowered to detain any person for a period not exceeding two years if he is satisfied as to the conditions precedent laid down therein. Whilst the words `any person` are not defined in the 
 o
rdinance I am inclined to hold that they include one who is being detained pending enquiries in accordance with the provision of s 3(1) or one who is at large; they cannot however, be given an extended meaning to include one who is being illegally detained for otherwise it would amount to the eclipse of a fundamental right guaranteed under art 5(1) of the Constitution, the disproportionate accumulation of power in one sphere and a negation of justice.
 
 
 
Section 4(1) of the Malaysian Ordinance is worded differently from our s 30 but the purpose of that provision is similar to that of s 30. Section 4(1) of the Malaysian Ordinance reads: 
 
If the Minister is satisfied that with a view to preventing any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the public order it is necessary that that person should be detained, or that it is necessary for the suppression of violence or the prevention of crimes involving violence that that person should be detained, the Minister shall make an order (hereinafter referred to as a detention order) directing that that person be detained for any period not exceeding two years.
 
 
 
With respect, I do not agree that an illegality in the detention orders made under s 44 of our Act renders the detention order under s 30 equally unlawful. Detention under s 44 is for the purpose of investigation. During this period there may be no satisfactory proof that the detainee had indulged in criminal activities. There may only be a mere suspicion. Hence, investigation is required and the section provides for an extended period of a further 14 days for investigation.
However, when the Minister makes an order under s 30 he must do so on the basis that he is satisfied that the detainee had indulged in criminal activities. A s 30 order is, therefore, independent of the orders under s 44. Any illegality in the former does not vitiate the Minister`s order (which the applicant in this case did not challenge). Furthermore, it does not make sense to say that the Minster may make a valid detention order if the applicant was at large or under lawful custody but not if the applicant was under unlawful custody. There is no reason to make such an exception as Mr Raman suggests. There is no difference, for the purposes of s 30, between a person at large and a person in unlawful custody. Indeed, the reasonable interpretation of the phrase `at large or in custody` must be that the minister may make a detention order wherever the detainee may be. I, therefore, respectfully disagree with the view held by Edgar Joseph Jr J in the 
 Koh Yoke Koon 
case. In any event, I make no finding of fact in respect of the complaints of the applicant in respect of his detention under s 44 and he is at liberty to pursue whatever redress available to him for the alleged wrongful arrest and detention during that period. The present detention is not to be disturbed. I, therefore, dismissed the application and fixed costs at $1,500.

Whether applicant was 'refugee'
 
This is an application for a writ of habeas corpus by one John Muhia Kangu, a Kenyan citizen, in respect of whom the government of Kenya had applied for extradition from Singapore.
From the facts presented to the court, it appears that the applicant, a police officer from Kenya, fled Nairobi on or about 12 November 1994 for Norway after being involved in an incident in which he and his colleague, another police officer, had reportedly opened fire and killed two unarmed persons owing to some confusion over their identities. After spending nearly nine months in Norway and after withdrawing his application to the Norwegian authorities for political asylum, he left Norway and arrived in Singapore on 4 August 1995, using his nephew`s passport, apparently, with a view to approaching the New Zealand High Commission in Singapore for political asylum. Upon his arrival, he was granted a 14-day social visit pass by the Singapore immigration department. The immigration officer at the entry point was admittedly unaware of the false nature of his travel documents.
On 11 August 1995, after being notified by the New Zealand High Commission that he was causing trouble whilst seeking asylum, officers from the Tanglin Police Division arrived at the High Commission to question the accused. He was later placed under arrest and referred to the Field Immigration Unit for being in possession and having used another person`s passport to travel to Singapore. Subsequently he was detained at Abingdon Prison from 15 August 1995 by order of the Controller of Immigration under the provisions of s 34(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) pending repatriation. He was, however, not charged in court since his identity could not be verified at the time of his arrest.
The authorities subsequently learnt that he was wanted by Interpol Nairobi for two counts of murder allegedly committed by him together with another person on 9 November 1994 and that a warrant had been issued for his arrest in Kenya on 17 December 1994. The applicant was as a result transferred to Changi Prison for safe custody.
On 16 September 1995, a superintendent of the Kenyan police arrived in Singapore to escort the applicant back to Kenya, but the applicant refused to return. On 10 November 1995, the Minister for Law (the minister) received a requisition from the government of Kenya through the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the applicant`s arrest and surrender. On 5 December 1995, the Ministry of Law received the extradition papers and supporting documents. The minister, having considered the depositions and the overseas warrant and after addressing his mind to the relevant provisions of the Extradition Act (Cap 103) (the Act), particularly ss 20 and 21 thereof and the restrictions contained therein (see the affidavit of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Law filed on 10 April 1996), exercised his discretion and issued a notice under s 22(1)(a) of the Act, authorizing a district judge in Singapore to issue the requisite warrant for the apprehension of the applicant provided that the provisions of the Act relating to the issue of such a warrant had, in the opinion of the district judge, been complied with.
The Permanent Secretary in his affidavit averred that the minister had no grounds to believe that the request by the Kenyan Government for the applicant`s surrender was politically motivated or that it was not made in good faith.
The extradition hearing which commenced on 15 January 1996 concluded on 19 January 1996 when the learned district judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to justify the extradition of the applicant to Kenya and that he be remanded pending the warrant of the minister for his surrender. The learned district judge also, as was required of him under s 26 of the Act, advised the applicant of his right to challenge the decision of the district judge by way of an application for a writ of habeas corpus to the High Court.
On 26 January 1996, the minister received from the district judge a certificate pursuant to s 24(8) of the Act, the warrant of commitment dated 19 January 1996, a certified true copy of the notes of evidence and all other court exhibits tendered during the commitment proceedings.
In the result, an application for a writ of habeas corpus was filed by the applicant through his former solicitors on 3 February 1996. Though there was some procedural non-compliance in relation to the said application, in the light of the fact the applicant appeared in person, I heard this application over three days. The applicant in challenging the commitment order issued by the court below, questioned its legality. In para 12 of his affidavit, the applicant said, inter alia: 
 
... The following are the points (sic) am raising in opposing the legality of the decision of the committal court in extraditing me to Kenya. As well as the legality of the committal warrant:
 
 
 
(i) The learned district judge of the subordinate court exceeded his jurisdictional powers by hearing and determining on a question I had raised in the committal court to the effect that the Kenya Government had in fact filed diplomatic extradition proceedings in Norway and thereby made a ruling on an issue of international kaw on matters involving two sovereign countries in regard to whether an extradition treaty exists between Kenya and Norway.
 
 
 
 
... I do wish to state further here that there is no dispute that the offence of murder is an internationally recognized extraditable offence and that no country in this world would give sanctuary or immunity against prosecution even in the guise of Geneva Convention also given the fact that most countries are now members of the International Police (INTERPOL) fraternity. The articles of the Geneva Convention are clear on the issue of giving or granting asylum to persons known to have committed crimes against humanity and, therefore, the issue of my application of political asylum should not have been construed as immunity against prosecution. 
 
(ii) The learned district judge failed to determine whether the issue I had raised in the committal court in that by the police officers of Tanglin Police Division effecting an arrest in the premises of the New Zealand Embassy in Singapore could be construed to (sic) a violation of my rights as a political asylum seeker as enshrined in the Geneva Convention of which Singapore is a signatory and thus a contracting state and by this action has in fact brought into conflict the two International Charters, viz (1) The Commonwealth Extradition Act, (2) The Geneva Convention. 
 
(iii) The Singapore authorities contravened the Commonwealth Extradition Act which is very clear and also stipulates the procedure to be followed in an extradition proceedings (sic) in regard to the action to be taken in the event of receiving provisional documents from the requesting designated commonwealth country. The authorities failed to produce me in court to answer the charge of extradition though the Kenyan Government had sent documents which could have warranted my production in court by remanding me for a period of and in excess of three months since the documents were first sent to Singapore. 
 
... 
 
[(iv) No sub-para iv] 
 
(v) The requisition made by the Kenyan Government to the Singapore authorities for my surrender to face trial for two counts of murder allegedly committed within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Kenya was not made in good faith and in the interest of justice because as in the case here have an element of a political flavour. 
 
... 
 
(vi) I am raising the point that whether the court would examine the sufficiency of the evidence as contained in the depositions submitted by the Government of Kenya to the learned district judge of the subordinate court, Mr Tan Puay Boon, if such evidence was sufficient to justify the conclusion to which the learned judge came. 
 
...
  
 
 
It is appropriate at this stage to refer briefly to the evidence contained in the depositions placed before the learned district judge during the proceedings below. It can be summarized as follows.
On 9 November 1994 at about 8.30pm, Mr Samuel Gachiengo Munyua and Mr Selesio Gakinda John were passengers in a Nissan Sunny bearing registration number KAC 492P driven by one Philip James Mwangi Munyua along Outering Road in Nairobi city. The applicant who was a police reservist attached to Nairobi Area CID was on patrol in a police car with another reservist, one Mohamed Raza. The applicant and his partner had, as a result of some confusion over the model and registration number of the vehicle involved in a robbery, mistakenly chased after the vehicle, believing that it was the vehicle of persons involved in the robbery. The driver of the vehicle KAC 492P, Philip James Mwangi Munyua, not knowing why he was being chased, drove the vehicle into a petrol station along Outering Road, thinking that it was a safe area. The applicant and his partner intercepted the vehicle at the petrol station and then opened fire at the two passengers whilst they were still in their vehicle, killing both of them on the spot. It appeared that more than 20 rounds of ammunition were fired at the vehicle. The evidence further showed that both the deceased persons were not warned to surrender; nor was there any evidence that they were in possession of any weapons.
There were altogether 14 authenticated depositions by the Kenyan Government placed before the learned district judge. Amongst them were the following:
 
 
(a) the depositions of Corporal Geoffrey Waruru Kinyua Waruru and Police Constable Francis Kiraguri Sunda which state that they saw the applicant and another policeman shooting at the vehicle when the two deceased persons were still inside it. They also saw the applicant and his partner removing the dead bodies from the car and placing them on the ground. 
 
(b) The deposition of Philip James Mwangi Munyua, the son of one of the deceased, which states that the two deceased persons were unarmed prior to the shootout. 
 
(c) The deposition of Bethuel Waweru Oburu which lists the circumstances under which the use of firearm is lawful under the provisions of s 28, (Cap 84) of the Laws of Kenya. The said section reads:
  
 
 
Section 28: 
 Power to use arms
.
 
 
 
A police officer may use arms against -
 
 
 
(a) any person in lawful custody and charged with or convicted of a felony, when such person is escaping or attempting to escape;
(b) any person who by force rescues or attempts to rescue another from lawful custody; 
(c) any person who by force prevents or attempts to prevent the lawful arrest of himself or any other person;
 
 
 
Provided that arms shall not be used -
 
 
 
(i) as authorized in paragraph (a), unless the officer has reasonable ground to believe that he cannot otherwise prevent the escape, and unless he gives warning to such person that he is about to use arms against him and the warning is unheeded;
(ii) as authorized in paragraph (b) or paragraph (c), unless the officer has reasonable ground to believe that he or any other person is in danger of grievous bodily harm or that he cannot otherwise prevent the rescue or, as the case may be, effect the arrest. 
(d) The deposition of Superintendent of Police Edward Muchori which states that in this case, 
 the applicant did not use his firearm lawfully as he had opened fire at the deceased persons without first ascertaining if they were armed and/or without giving them an opportunity to surrender. There was no evidence that the deceased persons were attempting to escape from custody at the relevant time. 
 (Emphasis is mine.) 
(e) The deposition of Police Inspector Benjamin Kioko which states that the applicant had admitted to him that he had shot at the two deceased persons. 
(f) The pathologist`s report reveals that both deceased persons had died of multiple injuries due to multiple bullet wounds. 
(g) The deposition of Corporal Caesar Gichovi Mbogo which states that the applicant was issued with a Browning service pistol 275989 KG with 26 rounds of ammunition. The ballistics report by Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police Benison G Nduguga, shows that three spent cartridges recovered from the vehicle in which the deceased persons were travelling, were fired from the applicant`s weapon.
 
 
 
The main contention of the applicant as appears from his affidavit as well as from his submissions is that the charges brought against him are not made in good faith, that they contain an element of political flavour (see para 12(v) of his affidavit) and further that he had been framed. In amplification, he suggested that the said political motivation was evident from the admission of one of the deponents, namely, Philip James Mwangi Munyua, in which it was stated that after the incident he and a few others went to a Kenyan Minister`s house to relate the events of 9 November 1994.
The applicant also argued that the documents placed before the committing district judge were irregular and invalid. He mentioned amongst other things the following: (a) that his middle name was wrongly spelt in the warrant of commitment issued by the district judge as being `Mulhia` instead of `Muhia`; (b) that some of the seals or rubber stamps appearing in the depositions and exhibits were doubtful; (c) that the charge sheet states that he was under arrest whereas he was in fact in custody; and (d) that some of the documents appear not to be duly authenticated.
The matters which should weigh in the mind of the court to which an application has been made for a writ of habeas corpus are tabulated under s 25 of the Act which provides that: 
 
... If a Magistrate before whom a person is brought in pursuance of section 24, or a court to which the person has applied for a writ of habeas corpus, is satisfied that, by reason of -
 
 
 
(a) the trivial nature of the offence that the person is alleged to have committed or has committed;
 
 
 
 
(b) the accusation against the person not having been made in good faith or in the interests of justice; or 
 
(c) the passage of time since the offence is alleged to have been committed or was committed,
  
 
 
and having regard to the circumstances under which the offence is alleged to have been committed or was committed, it would be unjust, oppressive or too severe a punishment to surrender the person to a declared Commonwealth country, or to surrender him before the expiration of a particular period, the Magistrate or court may -
 
 
 
(i) order that the person be released;
(ii) ... 
(iii) make such other order as he or it thinks just.
 
 
 
Besides the foregoing, there is a restriction under s 20(1) of the Act in relation to the surrender of persons connected with offences of a political character. Section 20(1) provides as follows: 
 
... A person shall not be liable to be surrendered to a declared Commonwealth country if the offence to which the requisition for his surrender relates is, or is by reason of the circumstances in which it is alleged to have been committed or was committed, an offence of a political character.
 
 
 
The nature of habeas corpus proceedings in extradition matters and the role of the court in dealing with such an application, had been dealt with in a number of House of Lords decisions. In 
 Schtraks v Government of Israel 
 
[1964] AC 556
, Viscount Radcliffe in his speech at p 585 commented: 
 
I think it clear that in habeas corpus proceedings which arise out of a committal order under the Extradition Act 1870, the court does not rehear the case that was before the magistrate, nor does it hear an appeal from his order. Its function, apart from considering any issue raised as to the offence charged being a political one, is to see that the prisoner is lawfully detained by his gaoler. I think that the distinction was accurately drawn by Lord Russell of Killowen CJ in 
 Re Galwey
, when he said:
 
 
 
`The prisoner then, having been taken into custody under the warrant of the chief magistrate, was brought before him, and we should, after the order of committal, be entitled to review the magistrate`s decision, not in the sense of entertaining an appeal from it, but in the sense of determining whether there was evidence enough to give him jurisdiction to make the order of committal. ... It seems to me that the only ground on which this habeas corpus can be successfully maintained is that the committal order was made without jurisdiction and was illegal.`
 
 
 
Later, in 
 Union of India v Manohar Lal Narang & Anor 
 [1977] 2 All ER 348 (HL), Viscount Dilhorne in dealing with the construction of s 8(3) of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1967 (UK) (equivalent to our s 25) observed at p 362e-f: 
 
... For it to order the discharge of a person, it must appear to the court that, for a reason stated in s 8(3), it would be unjust or oppressive to return him. This involves consideration by the court of the facts placed before it and the forming of an opinion as to the inferences to be drawn therefrom; in the present case it means considering all the materials before the court and then deciding whether or not the inference is to be drawn that it would be unjust or oppressive to return him. The court has, in my opinion, to decide a question of fact, not of law or of mixed law and fact. On an appeal the question whether or not there were materials before the court on which it could come to its conclusion will, of course, be a question of law. ...
 
 
 
In 
 Cheng v Governor of Pentonville Prison 
 
[1973] AC 931
, Lord Diplock (citing s 3(1) of the Extradition Act 1870 which is similar to s 20(1) of our Act) said at pp 944-945: 
 
The restriction which governs the instant appeal is that contained in s 3(1) of the Act:
 
 
 
`A fugitive criminal shall not be surrendered if the offence in respect of which his surrender is demanded is one of a political character, or if he proves to the satisfaction of the police magistrate or the court before whom he is brought on habeas corpus, or to the Secretary of State, that the requisition for his surrender has in fact been made with a view to try or punish him for an offence of a political character:`
 
 
 
The list of `extradition crimes` contained in Sch 1 to the Act in respect of which alone surrender may be demanded is to be construed according to the law existing in England. It comprises ordinary serious crimes in English law but like the earlier treaties includes none which on the face of it is of a political character as respects the requisitioning state, such as treason or sedition. It is evident, therefore, that the draftsman contemplated that there might be circumstances in which an ordinary crime, such as murder or attempted murder, might be `an offence of a political character.` From the second part of the restriction it is also evident, to put it bluntly, that the draftsman contemplated that a foreign government in its eagerness to revenge itself upon a political opponent might attempt to misuse an extradition treaty for this purpose.
 
 
 
My Lords, the noun that is qualified by the adjectival phrase `of a political character,` is `offence.` 
 One must, therefore, consider what are the juristic elements in an offence, particularly one which is an extradition crime, to which the epithet `political` can apply. I would accept that it applies to the mental element: the state of mind of the accused when he did the act which constitutes the physical element in the offence with which he is charged.
 I would accept, too, that the relevant state of mind is not restricted to the intent necessary to constitute the offence with which he is charged, for in the case of none of the extradition crimes can this properly be described as being political. The relevant mental element must involve some less immediate object which the accused sought to achieve by doing the physical act. It is unnecessary for the purposes of the present appeal, and would, in my view, be unwise, to attempt to define how remote that object might be. If the accused had robbed a bank in order to obtain funds to support a political party, the object would, in my view, clearly be too remote to constitute a political offence. But if the accused had killed a dictator in the hope of changing the government of the country, his object would be sufficiently immediate to justify the epithet `political.` For politics are about government. `Political` as descriptive of an object to be achieved must, in my view, be confined to the object of overthrowing or changing the government of a state or inducing it to change its policy or escaping from its territory the better so to do. No doubt any act done with any of these objects would be a `political act,` whether or not it was done within the territory of the government against whom it was aimed. But the question is not simply whether it is political qua `act` but whether it is political qua `offence.`
 
 
 
... This prima facie view of the meaning of the expression of `offence of a political character` derived from a consideration of the juristic nature of a criminal offence is, in my view, confirmed by a consideration of the purpose for which Parliament in 1870 imposed this restriction upon the surrender of fugitive criminals. 
 Ex hypothesi
the restriction only applies to an offender against whom a prima facie case has been proved that he has committed an act in a foreign state which would have been a serious crime if it had been committed in the United Kingdom. If committed in the United Kingdom, the offender would have been convicted and punished for it irrespective of any political motive directed against the government of any foreign state which inspired the offender to do it. It therefore cannot be supposed that the purpose of Parliament in imposing the restriction was to provide complete immunity for offences committed for political motives directed against the government of a foreign state wherever those offences happened to be committed. The immunity intended to be provided was at most a qualified immunity depending on where the offence was committed.
 
 
 
... [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In 
 T v Secretary of State 
 
 for the Home Department 
 [1995] 2 All ER 1042, Glidewell LJ in adopting Lord Diplock`s reasoning in 
 Cheng 
 (
 supra 
), said (at p 1054d) that a crime committed with the object of overthrowing or changing the government of a state or inducing it to change its policy, is to be regarded as a political crime, provided that the commission of a crime is not too remote from the objective and those were the essential principles established by English case law to apply in the closely analogous field of extradition law.
It is clear from the foregoing pronouncements that the court hearing a habeas corpus application does not rehear the case that was before the magistrate or district court. Its function, as stated by Viscount Radcliffe in 
 Schtraks 
(
 supra 
 ) is to consider whether the applicant was lawfully detained, besides hearing any issue as to whether the offence charged is political in nature. In my opinion, the principal contention of the applicant that the charges preferred against him possessed a political flavour, is outlandish and without any substance. The offences reportedly committed were not in pursuance of any political objective and the feature that a relative of one of the victims called at the residence of a Kenyan Minister soon after the incident to relate the event, does not transform the offences referred to as being political by any yardstick, nor does it render the charges suspect or lacking in good faith.
The applicant also referred the court to the Geneva Convention, apparently to the Convention Relating To The Status of Refugees signed at Geneva on 28 July 1951. Apart from the fact that Singapore is not a signatory to the said Convention, there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the applicant`s refusal to return to Kenya was due to his fear of being persecuted for reasons of religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or any political opinion so as to bring him within the description of `refugee` within art 1(A) therein. At any rate art 1F(b) of the Convention expressly excludes from its ambit persons such as the applicant, who are alleged to have committed serious non-political crimes outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee.
The applicant contended (para 12(i) of his affidavit) that the Kenyan Government by its earlier commencement of diplomatic extradition proceedings in Norway, is now precluded from instituting extradition proceedings in Singapore. This contention, however, is misconceived. Mr Edward Muchori, a Superintendent of Police from Kenya attached to Nairobi Area CID Headquarters, testified before the learned district judge that the Kenyan Government did not file any extradition application in Norway and that Kenya does not have any extradition treaties with Norway. In the light of the foregoing averments which I accepted, it appeared to me that the applicant was mixing up a request by the Kenyan Government to Norway, for their assistance in repatriating him with that of extradition proceedings.
The applicant also contended that some of the documents placed before the learned district judge were not valid. He even went to the extent of attacking a spelling error in his middle name appearing in the warrant of commitment. During the course of his submissions, the applicant insisted on testifying and testified that he was subject to some ill-treatment at the Changi Prison. I found all those allegations to be of no substance and that they did not, in any way, impugn the order made by the district judge. I also found his other allegation that the Singapore authorities had contravened the provisions of the Commonwealth Extradition Act (sic), to be equally unmeritorious since Singapore has its own provisions.
It is an established principle of law that when all the evidence has been presented, the magistrate`s duty is simply to enquire whether a 
 prima facie 
case has been made out against the accused by credible evidence (see 
 Chua Han Mow v Superintendent of Pudu Prison 
 
 
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 70
  adopting the principles enunciated by Bellamy J in 
 Re Osman Bin Abdullah 
 
 
 
[1954] MLJ 237
  at p 238). In my opinion, the depositions placed before the learned district judge amply justified his issuing the warrant of commitment; he had in no way exceeded his jurisdiction nor had he applied the wrong principles in arriving at the conclusion as he did.
Having considered all the arguments advanced by the applicant and the issues raised by him, I held that the decision of the learned district judge was beyond criticism. As a result, I dismissed this application as there was very little before me to conclude that it would be unjust or oppressive or too severe a punishment to return the applicant to face trial in the country where he is alleged to have committed the offences which in my opinion do not have any political hue.

Whether court had power to order suspended sentence
 
The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawful possession of 30.58g of opium, an offence contrary to s 8(a) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap185) (the Act). The appellant was convicted on the plea and sentenced by the district judge to two years` imprisonment. I dismissed her appeal. I now give my reasons.
The circumstances leading to the appellant`s arrest, subsequent charge and conviction for the offence is not material. I will not recite them. I propose only to deal with the mitigating circumstances.
The appellant is a 72-year-old woman. She is illiterate. She has been a chronic opium addict since she was about 31 years old. According to the mitigation, she was first given opium pellets by her parents-in-law to stop her severe post-natal bleeding. This was not disputed by the prosecution. She soon became an addict.
Due to her age, the appellant is suffering from a number of maladies. She is weak and suffers from respiratory ailments. In addition, she has scoliosis of her lumbar spine. This is also because of her age.
In 1980, the appellant was convicted for possession of prepared opium and utensils for the purpose of consuming drugs. On that occasion, she was fined $400 for each offence. She was not sent to the drug rehabilitation centre as persons above 55 years old are considered to be unsuitable for detoxification according to reg 6(1) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations promulgated under the Act. She therefore did not benefit from any treatment or rehabilitation.
Nevertheless, the 1980 conviction made the appellant`s conviction in the present case her second one for unlawful possession of drugs. Unfortunately for the appellant, s 33 and the Second Schedule of the Act provides a minimum sentence of two years` imprisonment for a second or subsequent conviction for an offence under s 8(a). There is therefore no discretion given to the court to impose any lighter sentence, no matter how exceptional the mitigating circumstances are. Counsel for the appellant conceded that the court does not have the power to grant the appellant a conditional or absolute discharge. Nor does it have the power to sentence the appellant to probation.
However, counsel submitted that s 212(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) allows the court to suspend a sentence of imprisonment. Section 212(3) provides: 
 
In the case of trials in any criminal court, if it appears to the court expedient, the court instead of pronouncing judgment may direct that the accused shall be released on his entering into a bond with or without sureties, and during such period as the court directs to appear and receive judgment, if and when called upon, and in the meantime to keep the peace and be of good character.
 
 
 
I was unable to accept this argument. A suspended sentence is a statutory creation. In the United Kingdom, the courts are given powers to suspend a sentence of imprisonment by ss 22 to 26 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973. Before that, they had this power under ss 39, 40 and 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967.
These sections contain detailed provisions as to when a suspended sentence may be given, how long the period of suspension can be and how the discretion may be exercised. They also lay down the procedure to be followed when giving such a sentence as well as provisions dealing with what is to be done when the accused commits an offence within the period of suspension. There is no such provision in Singapore.
In 
 Chan Kim Hoe v PP 
 [1954] MLJ xxvii, which is only reported in the notes section of the 
 Malayan Law Journal 
 , the President of the Sessions Court sentenced the accused to six months` imprisonment on each of three charges. He ordered that the sentences be suspended and that the accused be bound over to be of good behaviour if he made restitution. Abbott J held that the court has no such power: 
 
There is no provision known to the law in this country which permits of suspended sentences - although there is much to be said in favour of the system which I believe is American in derivation.
 
 
 
I agreed with Abbott J`s observation. Section 212(3) does not give the court any power to suspend a sentence indefinitely. Likewise, it does not allow the court to suspend the sentence for a limited time, nor does such a suspension serve any useful purpose, for there is no provision to cause the sentence to expire or otherwise disappear.
I was of the view that s 212(3) is merely a procedural section. It allows a court to reserve judgment and to release the accused on bond until the court is ready to give judgment. It is merely supplementary to s 212(1). Similarly, there is no power to suspend the giving of judgment permanently. In this respect, s 180(n)(ii) is also relevant. At the end of the trial, if the court finds the accused guilty or it has recorded a guilty plea, it must record a conviction and pass sentence. In the context, `pass sentence` includes the making of a probation order, or an order for conditional or absolute discharge.
Counsel referred to ss 173A and 294 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code (FMS Cap 6). He also referred to 
 PP v Idris 
 
 
 
[1955] MLJ 234
 . I did not find these references useful at all. Sections 173A and 294 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code are similar to ss 5 and 8 of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252). They are of no assistance in the present case.
I was therefore of the view that the court has no choice but to sentence the appellant to two years` imprisonment. That is the minimum sentence laid down by Parliament, and Parliament has not seen fit to give the court any power or discretion to suspend the sentence. Only the Public Prosecutor retains the prosecutorial discretion whether or not to prosecute, or to intervene and discontinue a prosecution in a particular case.
This was not an easy decision to make, but in arriving at it, I could only be comforted by the learned deputy public prosecutor`s assurance that drug addicts sentenced to imprisonment are treated and rehabilitated for their drug addiction by professional medical officers. These doctors are experienced in the treatment of drug addicts. To some extent, this would be preferable to letting the appellant remain in her present state of addiction.
In the present case, I could only direct the learned deputy public prosecutor to draw the prison authorities` attention to the special circumstances of this case and the appellant`s need for medical treatment. Apart from that, I was bound to dismiss the appeal.

 The relevant legislation 
Section 136 of the Copyright Act, in so far as relevant, provides: 
(1) A person who at a time when copyright subsists in a work -
 
(a) makes for sale or hire; 
(b) sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade offers or exposes for sale or hire; 
(c) by way of trade exhibits in public; or 
(d) imports into Singapore, otherwise than for private and domestic use,
 
any article which he knows, or ought reasonably to know, to be an infringing copy of the work shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for the article or for each article in respect of which the offence was committed or $100,000, whichever is the lower, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
 
(2) A person who at a time when copyright subsists in a work has in his possession any article which he knows, or ought reasonably to know, to be an infringing copy of the work for the purpose of -
 
(a) selling, letting for hire, or by way of trade offering or exposing for sale or hire, the article; 
(b) distributing the article for the purpose of trade, or for any other purpose to an extent that will affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright in the work; or 
(c) by way of trade exhibiting the article in public,
 
shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for the article or for each article in respect of which the offence was committed or $100,000, whichever is the lower, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
 
(3) Any person who, at a time when copyright subsists in a work, distributes, either -
 
(a) for purposes of trade; or 
(b) for other purposes, but to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright,
 
articles which he knows, or ought reasonably to know, to be infringing copies of the work, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.
 
...
(9) if information is given upon oath to a Magistrate that there is reasonable cause for suspecting that there are in any house, premises, vessel or other place any infringing copies of a work or other subject-matter in which copyright subsists (or any plate or contrivance used or intended to be used for making such infringing copies) by means of or in relation to which any offence under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4) has been committed, he may issue a warrant under his hand by virtue of which any police officer named or referred to in the warrant may enter the house, premises, vessel or other place and search for and seize any such copy, plate or contrivance; and if a copy, plate or contrivance is seized under this subsection in connection with an offence and -
 
(a) in proceedings brought under this section in connection with the offence no order is made under subsection (8) as to the copy, plate or contrivance; or 
(b) no such proceedings are instituted within 6 months of the seizure,
 
the copy, plate or contrivance shall be returned to the person in whose possession it was when it was seized or, if it is not reasonably practicable to return it to that person, shall be disposed of in accordance with the law regulating the disposal of lost or unclaimed property in the hands of police authorities.
 The decision below 
At the trial below, the court found at the close of the prosecution case that there was prima facie evidence of the subsistence of the copyright in the said three software programs. There was also prima facie evidence of the respondent`s knowledge or constructive knowledge that the copies of the software found in its premises pursuant to the search warrants were infringing copies.
However, the trial judge held that the appellant had failed to adduce evidence to support the elements of `
 sale 
 `, `
 possession for the purposes of sale 
`, `
 distribution for purpose of trade 
` and `
 make for the purpose of sale 
` in the corresponding 12 charges respectively. For convenience, these four different elements will henceforth be referred to as the `sale` or `distribution` element. Consequently, there was no case to answer. Accordingly, he acquitted the respondent of all the charges.
 Issues in this appeal 
The crux of this appeal concerned whether there was a case to answer. The only issue to consider was whether in the light of the totality of evidence presented, there was sufficient evidence for a prima facie case against the respondent. Bearing in mind that the appellant was unable to provide any direct evidence to prove that there was a sale or distribution of the software by the respondent to Haltech, the questions in this appeal were three-fold.
First, whether on the totality of evidence, it was reasonable to draw an inference of sale or distribution to satisfy the abovesaid elements of the charges. Second, in the event that such an inference could not be drawn, whether the presumption of sale under s 136(7) of the Act could be invoked in the circumstances. Third, whether the trial judge had correctly refused the application by the appellant for a summons to produce under s 58 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to turn up evidence of any sale or distribution.
 The appeal 
Reasonable inference
Section 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) provides: 
[if] the court finds that no case against the accused has been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction, the court shall record an order of acquittal.
The test to apply in deciding whether there is a case to answer is set out in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 . At the close of the prosecution case, what remains to be decided is a question of law only.
The court must act on the presumptions: (a) that all such evidence of primary facts is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inference as to further facts or state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of further explanation.
I recalled that in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 , Lord Diplock had added that the application of the test was similar to the English position of a trial by judge and jury. In this regard, Lord Lane referring to a jury trial, had stated in 
 R v Galbraith 
(1981) 73 Cr App R 124, at p 127, as follows: 
How then should the judge approach a submission of `no case`? (1) If there is no evidence that the crime alleged has been committed by the defendant, there is no difficulty. The judge will of course stop the case. (2) The difficulty arises where there is some evidence but it is of a tenuous character, for example because of inherent weakness or vagueness or because it is inconsistent with other evidence. (a) Where the judge comes to the conclusion that the prosecution evidence, taken at its highest, is such that a jury properly directed could not properly convict upon it, it is his duty, upon a submission being made, to stop the case. (b) Where however, the prosecution evidence is such that the strength or weakness depends on the view to be taken of a witness` reliability, or other matters which are generally speaking within the province of the jury and where on one possible view of the facts there is evidence upon which a jury could properly come to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty, the judge should allow the matter to be tried by jury. ... There will of course, as always in this branch of the law, be borderline cases. They can safely be left to the discretion of the judge.
In the case at hand, the evidence concerning a sale or distribution to Haltech was all circumstantial. The treatment of such circumstantial evidence was dealt with in 
Tan Siew Chay v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
  whereby LP Thean J stated, at p 38, the following: 
In considering whether the prosecution has made out a case against the accused, we have to adopt the approach as laid down by Lord Diplock, which we have set out earlier. We assume (a) that the evidence on the primary facts is true, unless the evidence is inherently incredible, and (b) that there will be nothing to displace the inference as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of further explanation. 
 The application of limb (b) necessarily involves the court drawing inferences from primary facts, and, in drawing such inferences, the court looks at the totality of the evidence and considers what inference, if any, that can reasonably be drawn therefrom. But, in considering any inference to be drawn, the court at this stage does not apply the test whether the evidence looked at in its totality would inevitably and inexorably lead to only one inference or inferences for establishing the essential elements of the charge.
 [Emphasis added.]
All that is required at this stage of the proceedings is a minimum evaluation of the evidence as a whole (also see 
Ng Theng Shuang v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 36
  ). The totality of the prosecution evidence must be considered. This requirement did not entail picking out all the plums and leaving the duff behind. If the evidence of the witness upon which the prosecution case depended on was self contradictory and out of all common sense or reason, the court is entitled to reach the conclusion that there is no evidence to support an essential ingredient in the charge; alternatively, the evidence may be said to be so inherently weak that it is inherently incredible or manifestly unreliable.
Of course, this will be a question of degree. But what this means is that if there are parts of the evidence which go towards supporting the charge, then that in itself does not assure that there is a case to answer. The state of the rest of the evidence must also be taken into account. To this may be added that at this stage of the proceedings, the assessment of credibility is usually not in issue, unless it had been so shaken that the prosecution is left with nothing. If the credibility is merely shaken, there remains a case to answer.
Briefly, the appellant`s case was that he had found infringing copies of his software in the respondent`s premises. Programs suspiciously similar to his copyrighted work were also alleged to be found in Harris. Since Rahmonic never sold any programs to Harris, the appellant contended that the respondent had sold or distributed the programs to their agent Haltech which in turn sold them to Harris.
Accordingly, the `sale` or `distribution` element in the charges was made out, the evidence being the inference that could reasonably be drawn in the circumstances. Of course, the other view was that the respondent might be in possession of the software programs, but it did not necessarily mean that they had sold or distributed them to Haltech. Therefore, it was unreasonable to draw such an inference. This latter view was adopted by the trial judge.
What then were the primary facts of this case? The following could be gleaned from the appellant`s submissions. It was undisputed that when Rahmonic collaborated with the respondent on the NSC Penang project in March 1991 to November 1991, Rahmonic had the Mark and Lead Software but the respondent did not.
It then transpired that one Dr Boey was allegedly working on the Mark and Lead Software in Rahmonic prior to joining the respondent. Kerwin Ang of the respondent company then allegedly obtained Dr Boey`s hard disk, which he knew contained source codes from Dr Boey`s previous place of employment (ie Rahmonic). The hard disk was subsequently given to Christopher Tan (PW5), an ex-employee of the respondent who now works for Rahmonic.
Apparently, PW5 had told Kerwin Ang that some of the programs in the hard disk were unlicensed copies. It was also alleged that Dr Boey must have known that as well. According to PW5, Khaw Chin Guan who replaced him on the vision system project at the respondent company was not capable of writing any of the software in issue, nor did he write any. Therefore the software found in the respondent`s premises must be PW2`s copyrighted work.
PW2 testified that the seized computer (exh P13) at the respondent`s premises contained copies of software identical to Rahmonic`s software, in particular the tGraph, TM/TC Driver and Mark and Lead`s inspection program. In his opinion, the `look and feel` of the program were similar to his copyrighted software. It was alleged that there was a sale of two vision systems by the respondent, either directly or through Haltech, which found their way to Harris.
Robin Kam (PW 3) testified that he saw the vision system of the respondent being exhibited in Haltech`s booth in Malaysia during an exhibition, after the raid at the respondent`s premises. He also stated that Haltech was a distribution company in Malaysia. Thus, in the normal course of human conduct, the sale had been made through Haltech.
PW2 and his counsel, Gilbert Leong (PW1), both claimed that when they were at Harris` premises, they had seen purchase orders between Harris and Haltech; the trial judge found that the contents of these documents were hearsay and inadmissible. Further, PW2 said that one Mr KH Tan of Harris had informed him that the two vision systems were purchased from Haltech. PW5 also claimed that Kerwin Ang had informed him that Haltech was dealing with the respondent`s products in Malaysia.
Both these alleged statements of KH Tan and Kerwin Ang were also held by the trial judge to be hearsay. PW5 went on to testify that he trained Haltech`s employees to maintain the vision systems in Malaysia. Apparently, he had even helped pack and crate two vision machines which were delivered by the respondent to Harris. He claimed to have gone to Harris` office in Kuala Lumpur on two occasions to repair these vision machines and was convinced that the software in Harris were infringing copies of Rahmonic`s software.
In this regard, PW2 also said that he had inspected the systems at Harris. After comparing them to the software in the respondent`s computer (exh P13), he claimed to be convinced that the software at Harris were infringing copies, despite admitting that he could not be certain that the software at Harris were his copyrighted work because he did not examine the source codes of the programs.
The appellant contended that in the circumstances, there was sufficient evidence of a sale by the respondent of the infringing copies of the software. In any case, it was argued that the presumption of sale under s 136(7) of the Copyright Act remained unrebutted. The appellant submitted that the evidence pointed solely to the fact that the respondent had made the infringing copies for sale. There was no doubt that the respondent had in their possession the infringing copies. The seizure was not challenged. They therefore had the infringing copies in their possession for the purpose of selling. Given the sale of the two vision systems, and given the trade of the respondent, they must also have been distributing the infringing software for the purpose of trade.
I considered the first three sets of charges under ss 136(1)(b), 136(2) and 136(3) of the Act together. Dealing specifically with the element of `sale` or `distribution` to Haltech as required under the charges, I noted that there was only circumstantial evidence to support either of these element.
To begin with, the alleged date of the offences was `on or about 17 September 1992`. However, all the evidence produced in court were in relation to items seized at the respondent`s premises on 19 May 1993. Therefore, there was no direct evidence that the items seized in 1993 were even similar to those allegedly sold or distributed to Haltech in 1992.
Touching on the oral statements allegedly made by KH Tan and Kerwin Ang, both of whom were not called upon to testify, I agreed with the trial judge that they were tendered for the truth of its content. Consequently, they were clearly inadmissible hearsay statements.
As regards the alleged purchase orders that were seen at Harris` premises, it was not open to the appellant to rely on s 63 read together with s 65(e) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) so as to render admissible the truth of the contents of such orders. The operation of ss 63 and 65, which provide for the adduction of secondary evidence, allows evidence to be tendered as to the content of a document that was seen, but not for the purpose of showing the content contained therein was true.
However, even if the contents of the purchase orders were tendered merely to show that Haltech had dealings with Harris, which would have been admissible, I did not see how this had any probative value to the charges at hand. There was still no evidence to link the respondent to the sale of such infringing works to Haltech.
PW3, who testified that he saw a Haltech booth that displayed the respondent`s vision systems on 10 August 1993 (after the raid at the respondent`s premises) at an exhibition in Malaysia, suggested that Haltech is a distributor of the respondent`s products in Malaysia. Therefore, the appellant argued that the respondent must have sold the infringing works to Haltech which in turn sold it to a third party, Harris.
In this respect, I noted that there was no evidence that Haltech or any of its officers had purchased any infringing copies of the respective software from the respondent. Further, none of the purported infringing copies which were sold to Haltech were produced in court. None of Haltech`s officers testified. It was thus pure conjecture that a sale or distribution had taken place.
During the raid at the respondent`s premises, PW2 then claimed to have seen a packaging box marked with the address and name `Harris`. In my view, this merely showed that the respondent had dealings with Harris, but did not mean that they were dealing with the particular software in question. Besides, this was irrelevant to the alleged sale and distribution to Haltech. The packaging box was, in any case, never opened to reveal its contents. The appellant did not produce it in court nor was any evidence led in respect of the delivery schedules. On the totality of the evidence, I found that it was too tenuous to infer that there had been a sale of the specific software programs in question to Haltech.
PW2 also argued that the trial judge had given undue weight to the fact that the search at the respondent`s premises did not turn up any evidence such as invoices or documents of sale linking the respondent with Haltech. He relied on the case of 
Lance Court Furnishing Pte Ltd v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 969
  whereby Kan Ting Chiu JC stated, at p 977, as follows: 
Section 136(9) [Copyright Act] empowers a magistrate to order seizure of infringing copies of any matter in which copyright subsists and the plates and contrivances used or intended to be used in the making of such infringing copies but not documents. Documents may be seized if they are in themselves the copyright infringement, eg pirated copies of literary works. Documents evidencing infringement without forming part of the infringement, eg production, sale or stock records, do not come under the ambit of s 136(9) and should not be seizable under a warrant issued under the provision.
Therefore, the appellant contended that, in the first place, they were not entitled to seize invoices of sale and their failure to produce the same at the trial should not be given any weight by the judge. I accepted the appellant`s argument that no weight should be given to such a failure; however, the fact that there was still insufficient evidence to suggest a sale or distribution remained unaltered.
The appellant was strenuously urging this court to draw an inference based on very weak circumstantial evidence. It seemed to me that there was insufficient basis for the court to reasonably draw the inference of a sale or distribution to Haltech. To hold otherwise would, in my opinion, create too low a threshold for the
 Haw Tua Tau 
 test. In effect, the appellant was contending that so long as a mere suspicion existed for such an inference to be drawn, then there must be a case to answer. In this case, a sale to Haltech was a conjecture. The appellant had only made a bare allegation that both Harris and the respondent possessed the infringing software, therefore it was argued that the inference of sale or distribution to Haltech ought reasonably to be drawn.
I was of the view that, in the absence of direct evidence, more circumstantial evidence was required to satisfy the 
 Haw Tua Tau 
test. The operation of the test as regards circumstantial evidence was well illustrated in 
PP v Oh Laye Koh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 385
  whereby the court was urged to draw an inference that the accused had murdered the victim. In that case, there were several strands of evidence coming together which allowed the court to draw the various inferences that collectively pointed towards a prima facie case.
Hence in my opinion, a reasonable inference has to point to a distinct and reasonable possibility: not just a suspicion. Mere possession of the infringing works per se did not prove that they were for the purposes of sale or distribution. Inferences amounting to conjecture and speculation are clearly not within the contemplation of the
 Haw Tua Tau 
test. The appellant`s case rested on mere speculation. Even if all the facts presented by the appellant were assumed to be true and were unrebutted, it still would not have warranted a conviction.
Relying on the evidence of PW5, the appellant subsequently seemed to contend that there was a direct sale of the vision machines by the respondent to Harris. I did not see how PW5`s testimony was relevant to the charges at hand, bearing in mind that the alleged sale and distribution of the infringing software programs were to Haltech. Moreover, the charges had stated that these alleged sales and distributions took place `on or about 17 September 1992` whereas PW5 had testified that the sales to Harris, if any, were in late November and early December 1992. In any event, the appellant did not produce any infringing software from the Harris machine. No officers of Harris came forth to testify.
Furthermore, the respondent pointed out that PW 5 was on the vision project for only about two months, having been taken off the vision project on 3 June 1992 upon replacement by Khaw Chin Guan who therefrom worked on the program. Thus, PW5 was testifying to the events in September 1992 relating to the vision project, although he no longer had any first hand knowledge of the software. PW5 also admitted during cross-examination that he did not know the exact contents of the Mark and Lead inspection software which he claimed was delivered to Harris. In the circumstances, I did not think that it was appropriate for this court to exercise its discretion in amending the charges.
Finally, in respect of the fourth set of charges under s 136(1)(a) of the Act, I took the view that even if copies were indeed made of the infringing works, there was still no evidence that the copies were made for purposes of sale. The position was of course different if the presumption of sale could be invoked.
However, I concluded that the presumption was inapplicable for reasons which I shall explain shortly. Hence, on the totality of the evidence presented before this court, I was satisfied that there was clearly insufficient evidence to support each and every ingredient in the charges.
 Presumption - section 136(7) Copyright Act 
Section 136(7) Copyright Act allows the presumption of sale to be invoked in certain circumstances. The subsection provides: 
For the purpose of this section, any person who has in his possession 5 or more infringing copies of any work or other subject-matter shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed -
 
(a) to be in possession of such copies otherwise than for private and domestic use; or
 
(b) to be in possession of such copies for the purpose of sale.
The appellant contended that the presumption of sale could be invoked since five copies of the infringing software were found in one of the computers of the respondents. However, the rationale of the presumption is obvious. It seemed to me to apply only when the various copies can easily be made available independently. This is because possession of the sheer number of independent copies, this being legislated at five copies, will imply that they are for sale.
Counsel for the respondent used the analogy of an audio tape. If a song were taped five times into five separate tapes, the presumption could operate because this suggested that the tapes were made for sale. But if the same song were taped five times into the same tape, then this was really no different from having one song in the tape. The possession of a single tape as such did not give rise to a presumption of sale.
The same logic also applied to a computer. In the instant case, PW2 and Lau Soo Leng (PW6), the latter being the appellant`s expert witness, both testified that there were more than ten copies of each of the three programs found in a single computer. It was obvious that, if there were only a single copy of the infringing software program, the presumption would be inoperative. Similarly, where all the software programs were in one computer, I did not see how this was any different from having one copy. There was no possibility of making quick and independent sales in this case. Thus, the presumption was inapplicable.
Moreover, if the hard disk in the computer system were to `crash`, all the copies and data would be lost. Such a method of saving the programs seemed inconsistent with using them for sale or distribution. I was therefore of the view that the trial judge had rightly held that the presumption could not be invoked.
The respondent went on to argue that in any event, even if the presumption were invoked, it would have already been rebutted by the appellant`s own evidence. Reliance was placed on the case of 
 Chee Chiew Heong v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 287
  whereby Chan J held, at p 288-289, as follows: 
In this case, the presumption had been rebutted by the cautioned statement. A presumption can be rebutted from the evidence adduced by the prosecution; see
 Soo Seng Huat v PP
 
 
 
[1968] 1 MLJ 80
  where Chang Min Tat J said:
 
`(It) does not mean to say of course that (a) presumption cannot be rebutted merely from the prosecution evidence. It can.`
 
The defence ought not to have been called at the close of the prosecution`s case. The presumption had been rebutted. All that had been proved by the prosecution at that stage was that she was in possession of a parcel. Because there was no longer any presumption there is therefore no evidence to show that the accused knew that the parcel contained heroin and morphine.
I agreed in principle that, where a presumption is properly triggered, it can still be rebutted by the prosecution`s own evidence. However, I must qualify that such a finding should, in most cases, be left till the end of the trial since this will usually involve weighing the evidence and making a finding of fact; a task not suitable for the court to undertake at this stage of the proceedings. Notwithstanding this, there remain exceptional instances whereby the presumption is so obviously rebutted by the prosecution`s own evidence that there ought not be a case to answer. This is again a question of degree.
Such an approach is entirely consistent with the 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 `s test. The words `if unrebutted` in s 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code oblige the court to ask itself a hypothetical question, `If I were to accept the prosecution`s evidence as accurate would it establish the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt?` The undoubted position is that, where the prosecution evidence has been so discredited or is so manifestly unreliable that no reasonable tribunal could safely convict on it, the court is entitled not to call the defence.
Likewise, where the presumption is already so obviously rebutted, it will effectively mean that there is no evidence at all to support an essential element of the charge. The prosecution`s case will have no leg to stand on. If there is no other evidence to support the element in the charge, the defence should not be called.
Returning to the instant case, the very fact that all the copies were found in the same computer clearly proved that the software programs were not for sale. This point was already canvassed earlier. Secondly, the computer seized was indisputably an employee`s computer; it could not have been for sale.
Thirdly, there was no evidence of any backup for the software program in question in other storage mediums such as disks or tapes. This suggested that the program was not valuable because if the system were to `crash`, all the data would simply be lost. Hence, the inference must be that the respondent`s possession of the program was not for the purpose of sale because the program was not regarded as valuable.
Fourthly, only the source codes for the Mark and Lead program were found in the computer. The appellant`s evidence showed that when one makes a sale, source codes are not provided. As PW2 himself stated during examination-in-chief: 
In my business when I sell a computer program, we supply only executable codes. We do not supply source codes because they are the rice bowls of our company.
Therefore, the presence of the source code contradicted the presumption of sale.
Taken together, all these evidence adduced by the prosecution pointed to only one obvious conclusion: the infringing copies could not have been in the respondent`s possession for the purpose of sale. The presumption was rebutted. An essential ingredient of the charge had not been made out at the close of the prosecution case; there was no case to answer.
 Section 58 Criminal Procedure Code 
The appellant contended that the trial judge was wrong in refusing to compel Marvis Wong, a director of the respondent company, to produce incriminating documents evidencing a sale or distribution to Harris, pursuant to s 58 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Section 58, as far as relevant, provides: 
(1) Whenever any court or police officer considers that the production of any document or other thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code by or before that court or officer, such court may issue a summons or such officer a written order to the person in whose possession or power the document or thing is believed to be requiring him to attend and produce it or to produce it at the time and place stated in the summons or order: ...
There was no question that if such incriminating documents did in fact exist, they would certainly have been relevant. Consequently, their production was `necessary` or `desirable` as required under s 58(1) for the purpose of the trial.
However, I took the view that the application was rightly refused. The power conferred under s 58 is specific. In
 PP v Teoh Choon Teck 
 
 
[1963] MLJ 34
 , Hepworth J stated, at p 36, as follows: 
These provisions are as applicable to documents in the possession of the prosecution as they are to those in the possession of any party to the proceedings.
 
The necessity for calling on parties to produce documents arises in criminal as in civil cases, because where documents are in the possession of the adverse party, before secondary evidence of their contents can be given the party offering it must prove that sufficient and timely notice to produce the documents has been given to the other party or his solicitor in those cases in which notice is necessary. The reason why notice to produce is required is not therefore to give the opposite party notice that the document will be used so that he may be enabled to prepare evidence to explain or confirm it, but merely to exclude the argument that the party desirous of proving the documents has not taken all reasonable means to procure the original (
 Sohoni`s Code of Criminal Procedure
 (15th Ed) Vol I, p 241).
 The document or thing must be clearly specified, that is, it must indicate the document to be produced and should be given at such time as to afford the party a reasonable opportunity for producing the document at the trial. A general direction to produce all papers relating to the subject in dispute will not be enforced. It must be directed at a specific document. [Emphasis added.] 
Therefore, an applicant must be precise as to the documents which he wishes the other party to produce. Similarly, a general demand for unspecified documents is inadequate. To allow otherwise, in the present case, was clearly unfair to the respondent since this would have practically permitted the applicant (the appellant) to initiate criminal proceedings against the respondent without having first amassed sufficient evidence to make a case.
The summons sought by the appellant was worded as follows: 
All IC Automation (S) Pte Ltd`s documents including but not limited to letters, brochures, invoices, quotation and marketing communication pertaining to the sale, hire or lease or offer of sale, hire or lease of computer controlled or computer interfaceable semiconductor inspection mechanism in the year 1992. In particular:
 
(a) quotation, invoices and delivery orders or notes addressed to or by Haltech (M) Sdn Bhd and
 
(b) all documentation including but not limited to letters, invoices and receipts concerning the sale of semiconductor inspection apparatuses.
 
The source codes of IC Automation (S) Pte Ltd`s SOIC system as at September 1992.
It appeared to me that the scope of the summons was too wide and amounted to a `fishing expedition` because the appellant could not even identify the documents that he specifically wanted. He had only made a blanket reference to any documentation relating to a sale, hire or lease in the summons. What he was asking for amounted to no more than the production of any incriminating documents, if they in fact did exist, so that effectively the respondent would be furnishing the alleged direct evidence of sale or distribution which was so lacking in the appellant`s own case in the first place. Thus, I agreed with the trial judge that the application should be refused.
 Conclusion 
In conclusion, I was not persuaded that the appellant had adduced sufficient evidence for a case to be answered. For the reasons stated above, I accordingly dismissed the appeal.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was charged with two offences under s 4(2) of the Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 338) (the Act) by having in his possession publications which were prohibited under s 3(1) of the Act vide Gazette Notification No 123 dated 14 January 1972 (Order 123) and Gazette Notification No 405 dated 4 February 1994 (Order 405).
These Gazette Notifications prohibited the importation, sale and circulation of all materials published or printed by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (WTBTS) and the International Bible Student`s Association (IBSA). In the district court the appellant was convicted and for each offence fined $1,000 and in default one week`s imprisonment. The appellant declined to pay his fine and in default served his prison term.
The facts were not in dispute. On 4 May 1995 the appellant, driving car registration number SBZ 1165R with five other passengers, was stopped at the Inward Car Bay of the Woodlands checkpoint. A search was conducted and books, pamphlets and compact discs, all of which formed the subject matter of the first charge were recovered from the boot of the car. The next day, the police raided the appellant`s house at Block 523 Bukit Batok Street 52, #12-703 and seized a list of items which formed the subject matter of the second charge.
It was not disputed that all the publications and materials were published by WTBTS or IBSA. Moreover the appellant had voluntarily given two statements to the police. He admitted that he had collected the materials (which formed the first charge) from Johor Bahru, placed them in the car and drove into Singapore. He intended to introduce the materials to his friends here. He also admitted that the exhibits seized from his home during the raid on 5 May 1995 belonged to him and were for his personal use.
The appellant belonged to a sect known as the Jehovah`s Witnesses. One of the fundamental doctrines of the sect is their belief that Satan is the God of the world. As such they maintain a complete separation from governments and regard world powers and political parties as the unwitting allies of Satan. Thus, they refuse to salute the flag of any nation or perform any form of national service or participate in public elections.
This resulted in the sect, the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah`s Witnesses, being deregistered on 14 January 1972 by the Singapore Government. Their activities also prompted the Minister for Information and the Arts (MITA) (then the Minister for Culture) to ban all publications by WTBTS and IBSA via Orders 123 and 405.
At the close of the prosecution case in the trial below, the defence made an application under s 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) for the following constitutional questions to be referred to the High Court: 
 
(1) whether individual Jehovah`s Witnesses professing and practising their beliefs as Jehovah`s Witnesses have the right to such publications which are religious in nature and are necessary for the practice of their religion as granted under art 15(1) of the Constitution;
 
 
 
 
(2) whether Gazette Notifications Nos 123 dated 14 January 1972 and 405 dated 4 February 1994 apply to such religious publications as are required by individual persons professing the religion of Jehovah`s Witnesses in accordance with art 15(1) of the Constitution; 
 
(3) whether the `act` in the context of religious publications of the religion of Jehovah`s Witnesses is to be determined by reference to the contents of such religious publications before such religious publications come within the exception of `any general law relating to public order` under art 15(4) of the Constitution and therefore the adherents of such a religion do not have a constitutional right to possess such publications; 
 
(4) whether the acts of the publisher must be ascertained where all the publications of the particular publisher are prohibited to determine violations of any general law relating to public order; and 
 
(5) if the refusal of eligible male Jehovah`s Witnesses to do military service on the basis of this religion of Jehovah`s Witnesses is the basis for invoking art 15(4) of the Constitution to prohibit all religious publications by the publishers WTBTS and IBSA then whether the contents of such publications must be examined in relation to such reference to military service before the said publication comes within the exception under art 15(4) of the Constitution.
  
 
 
Suffice to say, the trial judge dismissed the appellant`s application. In addition the trial judge found that the elements of the offences which the appellant was charged with had been proven beyond reasonable doubt and the appellant was convicted and sentenced accordingly. The appellant being dissatisfied with the conviction appealed.
In gist the appellant claimed that the trial judge had erred in not referring the Constitutional questions raised before him to the High Court pursuant to s 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321). In particular, counsel for the appellant contended that Orders 123 and 405 should be void in so far as they prohibited the publications of religious materials necessary for the practice of the Jehovah Witnesses` faith as it was contrary to art 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.
At the outset I should stress that it is in the discretion of the trial judge whether to stay proceedings to allow constitutional questions to be referred to the High Court. As I had earlier stated in 
Chan Hiang Leng Colin & Ors v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 662
  , the purpose of the discretion is to prevent unnecessary stays of proceedings each time a party purports to raise a constitutional issue. The merits of the case can then be considered by the trial judge before deciding whether such a reference ought to be made to the High Court.
In the present case, the questions raised by the appellant, albeit phrased differently, had already been dealt with in earlier cases decided by both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. As such there was no reason for the trial judge to have stayed the proceedings to allow these questions to be referred to the High Court.
In dealing with the questions which the appellant had sought to refer to the High Court, the starting point is art 15(1) of the Constitution, which provides that every person shall have the right to profess, practise and propagate his religion. It is clear that this fundamental right is constitutionally enshrined and has not been removed: see 
Chan Hiang Liang & Ors v Minister for Information and the Arts
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 609
 
However, art 15(1) must be read in the light of art 15(4) which states that `this article does not authorise any act contrary to any general law relating to public order, public health or morality`. Article 15(4) clearly envisages that the right to freedom of religion is subject to inherent limitations and is thus not an absolute and unqualified right. The scope of art 15 was succinctly explained by the Court of Appeal in 
 Chan Hiang Liang & Ors v Minister for Information and the Arts 
at p 615B-C: 
 
There is no provision in either the Societies Act or the Undesirable Publications Act which prohibits the holding of a religious belief. It is therefore not illegal to profess the beliefs of Jehovah`s Witnesses 
 per se
, nor is it an offence to be a Jehovah`s Witness. A citizen`s right to profess, practise or propagate his religious belief, even as a Jehovah`s Witness, has not been taken away. 
 It is the manner of carrying out these activities that is circumscribed by the relevant orders
. The relevant orders provide, that in pursuing these activities, Jehovah`s Witnesses may not be a member of the SCJW or any other unregistered society and they may not have access to the prohibited publications. [Emphasis mine.]
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant however, submitted that both Orders 123 and 405 were ultra vires as they sought to ban all publications regardless of whether they were religious publications or not; or whether the contents were in any way prejudicial or detrimental to the security of this nation. As such these Orders deprived the appellant and other Jehovah`s Witnesses of access to such publications which were necessary to the practice of their religion and thus constituted an infringement of art 15(1).
It has been conclusively decided both by the Court of Appeal in 
 Chan Hiang Leng & Ors v Minister for Information and the Arts 
as well as by the High Court in 
 Chan Hiang Leng v PP 
that Orders 123 and 405 were not ultra vires or unconstitutional nor were they inconsistent with art 15.
As I stated in 
Chan Hiang Leng v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 662
  at p 684 E-G: 
 
... religious beliefs ought to have proper protection, but actions undertaken or flowing from such beliefs must conform with the general law relating to public order and social protection. The right of freedom of religion must be reconciled with `the right of the State to employ the sovereign power to ensure peace, security and orderly living without which constitutional guarantee of civil liberty would be a mockery` (
 Commissioner, HRE v LT Swamiar
AIR 1954 SC 282)
 .
 The sovereignty, integrity and unity of Singapore are undoubtedly the paramount mandate of the Constitution and anything, including religious beliefs and practices which tend to run counter to these objectives must be restrained.
 
 
 
Moreover, at p 686F-H, I stressed that: 
 
... the court cannot interfere by substituting its own judgment for that of the minister. Section 3(1) clearly confers a discretion on the minister to order the prohibition of a publication if he is of the opinion that the importation, sale or circulation of that publication would be contrary to public interest. The court can only interfere with this opinion to the extent of ensuring that the minister exercises his discretionary powers according to the statutory limitations. The minister`s reasons for the ban emanated from considerations of national security and that the continued existence of the Jehovah`s Witnesses `would be prejudicial to public welfare and good order in Singapore`. Such considerations are clearly related to the public interest, and there could therefore be no objection that the prohibition order was made on an irrelevant ground. At the same time, I am of the view that it was a necessary corollary to the dissolution of the Jehovah`s Witnesses that their publications be prohibited. In essence, Order 123 reinforced the ban on the movement proper.
 
 
 
Thus it is clear that both Orders, which sought to ban 
 all 
 publications published by the WTBTS and the IBSA regardless of the contents of the publications, were not unconstitutional. As such, my reply to the first question raised by the appellant was an emphatic `no`. Individual Jehovah`s Witnesses professing and practising their beliefs as Jehovah`s Witnesses have no right to such publications which are religious in nature and are necessary for the practice of their religion as granted under art 15(1) of the Constitution so long as these publications are banned and prohibited under Orders 123 and 405.
As to the second question, counsel for the appellant again challenged the validity of Orders 123 and 405 as being too wide, ambiguous and disproportionate since they applied to all publications that are religious and necessary for 
 individual 
 Jehovah`s Witnesses to practice their religion.
For the same reasons given above, I was unable to accept the appellant`s contention. I could find no ambiguity in the wordings of Orders 123 and 405. It was crystal clear that the Orders were meant to restrict the rights of individuals as well as groups of persons to access of all publications by the WTBTS and the IBSA whether they were religious publications or not.
Moreover, under s 4(2) of the Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 338), the offence to possess without any reasonable excuse any prohibited publications, does not make a distinction between possession by an individual and possession by a group or society.
As for the question of proportionality, this had been conclusively disposed of under the rubric of irrationality by the Court of Appeal in 
 Chan Hiang Leng & Ors v Minister for Information and the Arts 
, where Karthigesu JA held: 
 
Hence, this leaves the appellants with only the ground of irrationality. At this initial stage of application for leave, we are prepared to accept that Order 405 of 1994 covers innocuous publications printed or published by IBSA such as the King James` version of the Bible. We also accept that Order 405 of 1994 deprives Jehovah`s Witnesses who are women or senior citizens, and who are not required to do National Service, of literature which are necessary for the profession, practice and propagation of their religious belief. We are even prepared to accept that there could well be other less restrictive methods which the minister could conceivably adopt. In particular, we accept that conscientious objectors are already dealt with under the Enlistment Act. In the picturesque words of counsel, we will even assume at this stage that the minister may have used a sledge-hammer to crack a nut when he issued Order 405 of 1994.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
In the present case , we are not prepared to say, even accepting all that Mr How had said, that Order 405 of 1994 is one which no reasonable minister would issue. There is no reason why the Minister may not consider it necessary to prohibit the King James` version of the Bible printed by IBSA, as part of a broader order banning publications by IBSA, in view of the fact that the same version printed by other sources is readily available. Similarly, the minister may consider that although there are women and other members of the Jehovah`s Witnesses faith who do not have to do National Service, they may have some influence on male members who do have to do National Service or even on male citizens who are not members of the faith. Such considerations are thrown up by simple common sense. In other words, the appellants` case, put at its highest, was insufficient to show what might turn out to be an arguable case that the minister had acted irrationally when he issued Order 405 of 1994.
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal decided that the appellants did not have `even the very minimal requirement that they have something which might turn out to be an arguable case for judicial review` of Order 405. In the light of this ruling, I did not see any reason to refer the appellant`s second question to the High Court.
I shall deal with the third and fourth questions together as they dealt essentially with the same issues. In essence, they raised the question of whether the Orders were too wide and whether the nature of the publications and the act of the publisher should be ascertained in order for the publications to fall within art 15(4). Again, these two questions had been dealt with in previous cases and did not need to be referred to the High Court for determination.
In 
Chan Hiang Leng Colin v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 662
  , counsel for the accused argued that Order 123 was unexpected, indiscriminating, excessive and sweeping. It was contended that such power to prohibit all publications of a specified publisher should only be exercised when the publisher habitually published materials contrary to the public interest. However, many of the publications could not have been regarded as contrary to the public interest.
Counsel for the accused illustrated this contention by stating that in effect the ban would extend to the King James Version of the Bible as well, as long as it was printed and published by WTBTS, which was wholly unreasonable as the this was widely circulated in Singapore. To that argument and to the arguments before me in this case, I reiterate my stand: 
 
I do not see the merit of this contention. The fact that one publication is unobjectionable as to its contents, be it the King James Version or `Alice in Wonderland` does not make the ban unreasonable per se. Instead, it was not unreasonable, in my view, for the minister to prohibit all publications by WTBTS. The minister`s actions were clearly to stop the dissemination and propagation of beliefs of the Jehovah`s Witnesses and this would of necessity include every publication by WTBTS. Any order other than a total blanket order would have been impossible to monitor administratively.
 
 
 
The same issues which had been raised by these two questions had been decisively determined by previous decisions. It there was anything indisputable, it was that the ban on the publications was total and not with reference to their contents but by reference to the publisher. As I had already explained, any order other than a total blanket order would be administratively inconvenient. It would be absurd to expect every published material to be vetted. Hence a total blanket order was the only possible administrative solution. Moreover, since the validity of Orders 123 and 405 was not in doubt, the appellant`s claim would not succeed.
With regard to the fifth and last question, I would repeat the same points discussed above. The prohibition orders were total blanket orders, regardless of the contents of the publications. There is no requirement in the Orders that sufficient nexus had to be found in the contents of the publications with reference to military service before the publications came within the exception under art 15(4).
It was evident that the appellant was repeating the same arguments in a different form, although they had been thoroughly considered and rejected. I agreed with the trial judge below that there was no need and indeed no justification for a reference to the High Court under s 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321).
It was clear that Orders 123 and 405 were made to protect the public interest and the objective was evidently for the preservation of national security. The courts have time and again recognised that the Jehovah`s Witnesses were engaging in conduct which was prejudicial to the nation`s security. The ban in toto was clearly to stop the dissemination and propagation of their beliefs as a whole and this would of necessity include every publication by WTBTS and IBSA. It was their own actions that had brought about these consequences and they can blame no one but themselves.
In the present case, the trial judge had exercised his discretion correctly and refused to refer the questions to the High Court under s 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321). Finally, I should stress the following point again. The freedom of religion guaranteed under art 15(1) is not absolute but qualified by controls necessary to serve the public interest and to protect national security. This was explicitly provided for under art 15(4).
The High Court of Australia has also endorsed this position in the case of 
 Adelaide Company of Jehovah`s Witnesses Inc v The Commonwealth 
(1943) 67 CLR 116 in which the provision as to religion in the Australian Constitution was in issue. To quote the words of Latham CJ at p 131: 
 
... liberty did not mean the licence of individuals to do just what they pleased, because such liberty would mean the absence of law and of order, and ultimately the destruction of liberty ... . It is consistent with the maintenance of religious liberty for the State to restrain actions and courses of conduct which are inconsistent with the maintenance of civil government or prejudicial to the continued existence of the community.

This is an appeal and cross-appeal from the decision of Goh Joon Seng J in Suits No 279 of 1991 and 1704 of 1992. The actions were consolidated. In Suit No 279 of 1991, R Esmerian, Inc (RE Inc) claimed against Ghassan Fakhreddin (Fakhreddin), Diamond Centre Pte Ltd (Diamond Centre) and Zhang Qing Ying @ Peter Teo (Teo) for conversion. RE Inc sought, inter alia, the return of certain pieces of jewellery, damages, a declaration that they are the rightful owners of the jewellery and a declaration that Teo and Diamond Centre were constructive trustees of other pieces of jewellery allegedly received by them. In Suit No 1704 of 1992, Corvina Securities Inc (Corvina) claimed against Teo, also for conversion. Corvina sought, inter alia, the return of certain pieces of jewellery and damages. The facts of the case are set out below.
 The parties 
RE Inc is a company incorporated in the State of New York with a reputation for fine jewellery. Its chief operating officer is Ralph Oliver Esmerian (Esmerian). Corvina is a company incorporated in Panama. Its sole shareholder is Emmanuel Guillaume (Guillaume).
Wolfers Trading AG (Wolfers) is an old Swiss company dealing in jewellery. At the relevant time, it had just been recently acquired and was controlled by the Descamps brothers, one of whom is Patrick Descamps.
Fakhreddin is an Iraqi national. At the time of the trial, he was serving a sentence of imprisonment in Switzerland for offences arising out of jewellery entrusted to him on consignment, including those claimed by the plaintiffs in these two actions. He was named as a defendant, but was not served with the writ. Although described as having the aliases Elias Samir Edouard or Samir Edouard, it appeared that this was a name he used on a fake passport. It was mentioned below that Samir Edouard is actually a respected person in Dubai.
Diamond Centre is a company incorporated in Singapore dealing with jewellery. Teo is a director of Diamond Centre. According to the records in the Registry of Companies and Businesses, he is a minority shareholder in Diamond Centre. However, he claims to be entitled to 50% of its profits. Teo and Diamond Centre will be collectively referred to as the defendants and RE Inc and Corvina as the plaintiffs.
 The plaintiffs` evidence 
The consignment
Sometime towards the middle of 1989, the Descamps brothers approached Guillaume in Paris. The Descamps brothers informed Guillaume that a royal marriage was about to take place in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Descamps brothers were looking for jewellery to sell in connection with this wedding and asked Guillaume to source for high quality jewellery. Guillaume approached Esmerian in New York and conveyed to him what the Descamps brothers had told him. Guillaume requested for a consignment of jewellery in the name of Corvina. It was understood that Corvina would, in turn, consign the jewellery to Wolfers after a mark-up. Esmerian was familiar with Wolfers as his family had dealings with Wolfers stretching over three generations. Esmerian and Guillaume selected jewellery that they thought would be suitable.
The first consignment to Corvina was handed over on 7 and 8 September 1989. The jewellery were consigned on RE Inc`s standard terms of consignment in a memorandum. This stated, inter alia: 
 
The merchandise described on the other side is received ... upon the express condition that all such merchandise shall remain the property of R Esmerian, Inc and shall be returned on demand ... . Consignee acquires no right or authority to sell, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the merchandise, or any part thereof ... . A sale of all or any portion of the merchandise shall occur only if and when consignee shall have received from R Esmerian, Inc a separate invoice covering specific merchandise on the memorandum ... .
 
 
 
Guillaume took delivery of this consignment and proceeded to Geneva. There, at Geneva Airport, on behalf of Corvina, he consigned the jewellery to Patrick Descamps, who was representing Wolfers. Wolfers in turn consigned the jewellery to Fakhreddin. Fakhreddin selected the jewellery in the presence of Guillaume, Patrick Descamps and one Horriyat.
Patrick Descamps had consulted Guillaume on the terms of the consignment memorandum between Wolfers and Fakhreddin. Guillaume was not present when the agreement was signed. The memorandum was signed when part of the consignment was handed to Fakhreddin by Patrick Descamps. Youssel Alain Edery (Edery), who gave evidence for the plaintiffs, was present when Fakhreddin signed the memorandum on 22 September 1989 and took delivery of the items. Edery was a partner of Fakhreddin.
By art 1 of Wolfers` memorandum, which was in French, the jewellery were handed to Fakhreddin to enable him to do a special presentation to his customers in the UAE. They might not leave the UAE for any destination except Geneva. By art 2, the jewellery were entrusted to Fakhreddin for 15 days only and had to be returned to Geneva unless an extension was obtained from Wolfers. By art 7, any item sold was to be paid for immediately and any item not paid for and not returned remained the property of Wolfers. By art 10, it was agreed that the Wolfers memorandum was to be interpreted according to Swiss law and both parties agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the Swiss courts.
Guillaume handed the rest of the jewellery in the first consignment to Fakhreddin on 27 September 1989. On this occasion, Guillaume also delivered to Fakhreddin a second consignment of jewellery. Except for a 30.31 carat sapphire ring (the Wolfers sapphire ring) which was Wolfers`, these belonged to another jeweller, Horovitz & Totah. The items in the second consignment do not form part of the subject matter of these proceedings, though the Wolfers sapphire ring was part of the evidence. A third consignment consisting of two items was delivered by Guillaume, for Wolfers, to Fakhreddin on 7 October 1989. These are also not the subject matter of the proceedings.
Guillaume then returned to New York. He obtained a second consignment of jewellery from Esmerian on 25 October 1989. These were subject to a memorandum between RE Inc and Corvina, which was similar to the first one. This consignment, together with a pair of pear-shaped emerald and diamond earrings from Rima Investors Corporation (Rima) (the earrings will be referred to as `the Rima emerald earrings`), was handed over to Fakhreddin on behalf of Wolfers by Guillaume on 27 October 1989.
 The failure by Fakhreddin to return the jewels 
Fakhreddin was supposed to return the consignments by 11 November 1989. He failed to do so or to pay for the goods. Between 11 November 1989 and 5 December 1989, Guillaume kept in constant touch with Patrick Descamps. According to Guillaume, Patrick Descamps told him that Wolfers had finally told Fakhreddin (via a telex exhibited in evidence) that he must return all the jewels by 5 December 1989 and pay for whatever was not returned. Patrick Decamps faxed to Guillaume a file of correspondence between Wolfers and Fakhreddin.
Following that telex, Guillaume and Patrick Descamps met Fakhreddin at Geneva Airport on 5 December 1989. Fakhreddin returned some of the jewels. They then proceeded to the premises of Horovitz & Totah. There, they were joined by Totah of Horovitz & Totah, and one Ador who was Paul Descamps` lawyer. Ador was there to represent Wolfers.
Fakhreddin was asked why he had not returned the jewels. Fakhreddin said that they were in the hands of some sheikhs in the UAE. Fakhreddin listed the names of these sheikhs. Guillaume later called up the private secretary to one of the sheikhs mentioned and was told that Fakhreddin had never shown the sheikh the jewels. Fakhreddin signed an undertaking to return the remaining jewels by 19 December 1989 and to procure a letter of credit for the jewels by way of security. The jewellery were not returned by 19 December 1989 and no letter of credit was opened.
In 1990, Guillaume went to Dubai on three occasions to attempt to recover the jewellery. On his first trip in January 1990, Fakhreddin returned a few items. The second trip was fruitless. On the third trip, Fakhreddin returned a few more items of little value.
 What Fakhreddin had been doing in the mean time 
Evidence relating to this was given by Edery. Edery had known Fakhreddin for some ten years. They had started a clothing company in 1983, which was wound up in 1986. Edery lost touch with Fakhreddin until 1988, when Fakhreddin invited Edery to join him in the jewellery business, which Edery did in 1989. They started off with a couple of consignments from a jeweller named de Becker.
In the same year, Edery contacted a jeweller by the name of Alexandre Reza (Reza). Reza initially let them have some jewellery on consignment but insisted that they be accompanied by his employee, one Fournet. Edery and Fakhreddin signed for these consignments jointly. After two consignments, Reza agreed that Fournet need not accompany them. However, Reza insisted that he arrange for the insurance himself.
Edery`s agreement with Fakhreddin was that each party could still do their own private business. In September 1989, Edery accompanied Fakhreddin to Geneva, where Fakhreddin signed a consignment agreement and took delivery of some jewels. Edery was asked to go along to help Fakhreddin read the French agreement. They met Patrick Descamps at Geneva Airport, where the transactions took place. Edery explained the contract to Fakhreddin before Fakhreddin signed it. Edery left for Paris after this.
It was Fakhreddin`s idea to come to Singapore. They brought along the Reza consignments as they could not be sold in Dubai. They arrived in Singapore on 14 January 1990 together with a friend, Zurita, who was a boxing promoter. In Singapore, they met one Dr Tay of the Hour Glass, a company selling expensive watches. Fakhreddin had left some carpets there and he wanted to show the Reza consignments to Dr Tay. Dr Tay was not in, so they went to Orchard Road. Edery had wanted to have some shirts made. They stopped at Lucky Plaza. They encountered a jewellery shop called Diamond Centre. They asked to see the manager. An appointment was made for the afternoon.
Fakhreddin and Edery returned to Diamond Centre in the afternoon. Fakhreddin brought along two sapphires he had with him. Edery was not certain whether they were loose stones or rings. There they met Teo. Teo agreed to meet them again in the evening to view the consignments. They introduced themselves as representatives of Reza and showed Teo the consignment notes. The next day, they went to Teo`s office again as Fakhreddin wanted to sell the two sapphires.
Teo requested that the stones be left with him so that he could study them. Fakhreddin proposed that Teo give him a cashier`s cheque for US$600,000 as security. It was agreed that Fakhreddin will undertake not to cash it for a few days. They then went with Teo to the Republic National Bank of New York. The agreement was drafted by the vice-president, Yap Lip Leong (Yap). Yap talked about Teo in glowing terms, saying that Teo was an important businessman with business in Brunei.
Fakhreddin persuaded Edery to allow Teo to bring the Reza consignments to Brunei. Edery was initially reluctant as they were not supposed to part with the consignments. Edery required Fakhreddin to sign a memorandum whereby Fakhreddin took full responsibility for the goods entrusted to Teo. Teo also signed a consignment note. These were destroyed when Teo returned the consignment on 18 January 1990.
Edery went back to Dubai and returned to Singapore. Fakhreddin told him that he had sold the sapphire to Teo for US$200,000 (then S$375,000). This turned out to be the Wolfers sapphire ring.
On their second trip to Singapore, they consigned to Teo a second Reza consignment. On the third trip in March 1990, Fakhreddin showed Teo a number of jewels for sale. These were for his own account. When they left on 22 March 1990, Teo gave Fakhreddin a small consignment of jewellery for sale in Dubai. There was a fourth trip to Singapore in April 1990 but it appeared to Edery that no business was transacted.
On 15 May 1990, Reza summoned Edery to his house. Fakhreddin had told Edery that he (Fakhreddin) had collected a consignment of jewellery from Reza on 30 March 1990. Fakhreddin told him that the consignment was with Teo. Reza wanted Edery to sign the consignment note. This Edery did on 18 May 1990 after indicating that it was signed on that day. Immediately thereafter, Edery was served by a process server with papers calling for the return of the consignment. Reza ordered Edery to go to Singapore and collect the consignment. Reza was given the impression that they were in a bank vault in Singapore. Edery asked Fakhreddin to call Teo.
Edery arrived in Singapore on 22 May 1990, but Teo was overseas. Edery called Reza and lied to him that he had the jewels, but would return to Paris after two or three days. He told Reza he had to see some clients. The next day, Edery went to Yap`s office. Yap suggested that Edery speak to Fakhreddin to find out more about what transpired between Fakhreddin and Teo. Fakhreddin told Edery not to worry and that he would call Teo. Teo never contacted Edery.
Edery managed to reach Teo between 25 to 27 May 1990. Teo refused to return the jewellery. He said that he had consigned goods to Fakhreddin for Dubai and that Fakhreddin owed him money. The Reza consignment was security. Edery told Teo that as the consignment was not returned `some people were getting worried.` Edery suggested to Teo that he should not keep items that did not belong to him. He told Teo that he should settle the private account with Fakhreddin, as once Reza was involved `it would become a phenomenal problem.` According to Edery, Reza apparently had a fearsome reputation. Teo refused.
Edery had no choice but to tell Reza everything. Reza came to Singapore. They met Poon, the other shareholder and director of Diamond Centre. Teo was out of the country again. Poon confirmed that Diamond Centre had the jewellery. Poon refused to return them before Reza had spoken to Teo. They went to Yap`s office. Yap declined to disclose anything, on grounds of confidentiality, until Reza called someone on the phone, who in turn spoke to Yap. Apparently it was someone from the bank`s head office. Yap disclosed that Teo had signed a guarantee for Fakhreddin for US$1.2m towards the end of February 1990.
Fakhreddin arrived from Paris and joined them. Teo finally called Reza. Reza asked Teo to return part of the consignment as it was valued at US$17.5m, against the debt of US$1.2m. Teo agreed. Reza collected four items out of the eight that were in the consignment. We should mention that there was some confusion in Edery`s evidence as to the number of items involved. Eventually the matter was settled by Reza taking over Fakhreddin`s debt to Teo, which included US$300,000 for part of Teo`s consignment, which had not been returned, in return for jewellery and four carpets left by Fakhreddin with Teo.
According to Edery, in Proceedings No 1880/90 in the Tribunal de Grandi Instante in Paris, Reza admitted that he received the precious stones from Teo. That was an action by Reza against Fakhreddin and Edery. Edery said that Reza lost the action against him both at first instance and on appeal. However, the records of proceedings in the Paris proceedings are not admissible as evidence here.
 The recovery of jewellery in Singapore 
In the meantime, Esmerian was trying to track down the Esmerian jewellery. Colour photocopies of photographs with full descriptions of the Esmerian jewellery were sent to dealers, auction houses and retailers all over the world. In late January 1991, he received information from a friend that some of the Esmerian jewellery had been seen in Singapore. Esmerian contacted Guillaume and they both came to Singapore. After visiting a few jewellery shops, they came across Diamond Centre.
On display in the shop window was a ruby ring belonging to RE Inc (the Esmerian ruby ring). This was priced by Diamond Centre at S$620,000 to S$630,000. They inquired whether there were other outstanding pieces of jewellery available. They were shown the Wolfers sapphire ring. The next day, they were shown the Rima earrings.
Esmerian and Guillaume consulted their lawyers, Messrs Rodyk & Davidson. A police report was lodged on 4 February 1991. RE Inc commenced proceedings. An Anton Piller order was obtained on 7 February 1991. The police then raided the premises of Diamond Centre. This was immediately followed by the execution of the Anton Piller order.
The Wolfers sapphire ring and Esmerian ruby ring were seized. The Rima earrings could not be found. They had been consigned to the Hour Glass and were handed to the police by Teo. Two loose sapphires belonging to RE Inc (the Esmerian sapphires) were also found, as were six coloured diamonds and 107 round pink diamonds which were part of a pair of earrings from RE Inc. The earrings were described as fancy blue and canary diamond earrings (the Esmerian blue and canary diamond earrings). No document relating to these items were found in Diamond Centre`s files during the execution of the Anton Piller order.
 The jewellery recovered 
The jewellery recovered were, firstly, the Wolfers sapphire ring. This is a 30.31 carat sapphire ring which belonged to Wolfers. It was priced by Wolfers at US$850,000.
Secondly, there were the Rima emerald earrings. These are a pair of pear-shaped emerald and diamond earrings from Rima Investors Corporation. The two emeralds weighed 25.48 carats. They were set with 48 diamonds weighing 28.5 carats. They were consigned by Rima to Corvina at US$625,000, by Corvina to Wolfers at US$630,000 and by Wolfers to Fakhreddin at US$770,000. Guillaume claimed that Corvina bought these from Rima, as Rima had demanded that Guillaume pay for them when they were not returned. Guillaume paid Rima US$600,000. Guillaume testified that Rima told him that they paid US$196,735 in November 1985 for them.
Third, there was the Esmerian ruby ring. This consists of a 6.28 carat Burma ruby mounted in a ring with round and pear-shaped diamonds. The Burma ruby was purchased by Esmerian in 1980 as a 6.64 carat stone for US$365,200. It was re-cut and mounted for Esmerian. It was consigned by RE Inc to Corvina at US$625,000, by Corvina to Wolfers at US$650,000 and by Wolfers to Fakhreddin at US$950,000.
Next, parts of the Esmerian blue and canary diamond earrings were found. The earrings consisted of a blue VVS2 marquise-shaped diamond of 3.11 carats, a blue I1 pear-shaped diamond of 3.07 carats, a greyish-blue IF round diamond of 1.47 carats, an intense yellow IF marquise-shaped diamond of 3.25 carats, an intense yellow VS1 pear-shaped diamond of 3.37 carats, an intense yellow VVS2 round diamond of 1.51 carats and 108 round pink diamonds totalling 4.88 carats.
The six stones and 107 pink diamonds were seized from Diamond Centre. They were in loose form. The invoices produced by Esmerian showed that RE Inc paid a total of US$334,505 for the six stones alone over a period of time starting from 1980. Esmerian designed the earrings and had them made. The earrings were consigned by Esmerian to Corvina at US$1.4m, by Corvina to Wolfers at US$1.45m and by Wolfers to Fakhreddin at US$1.65m.
Lastly, there were the Esmerian sapphires. The two sapphires came from a sapphire and diamond necklace and pendent set. The two sapphires respectively weighed 23.41 carats and 39.74 carats. The first was from the necklace. The second was from the pendent. The bigger sapphire cost Esmerian US$160,000 in 1976. The necklace and pendent set was priced by RE Inc at US$2.5m.
 The defence`s evidence 
How the jewels were purchased from Fakhreddin
The main defence witness was Teo. According to Teo, sometime in January 1990, Poon informed him that one William Foo (Foo) who worked for Ong Beng Seng, a well-known hotelier and property developer, had brought Fakhreddin to see him. Ong Beng Seng was a personal friend of Teo`s for ten years, or so said Teo. Fakhreddin came with Edery and a body guard. Fakhreddin introduced himself as the president of Fakhreddin Brothers and an associate of Reza, whom Teo had heard of.
Fakhreddin showed Teo two rings and told him that he knew a Dr Tay of the Hour Glass and Ong Beng Seng. Fakhreddin said that he had entrusted carpets to the Hour Glass. Teo called up Robert Sia at the Hour Glass and confirmed that Fakhreddin had consigned carpets to them. According to Sia, this was all Teo asked. Fakhreddin asked for US$600,000 for the Wolfers sapphire ring. Teo had it consigned to him for a few days in return for a US$600,000 cashier`s cheque as security. He brought Fakhreddin to see Yap at the Republic Bank of New York. Teo brought the ring to Brunei and offered it for S$1.5m, but was unable to sell it.
Teo returned the Wolfers sapphire ring when he came back to Singapore and took back the cashier`s cheque. On 21 January 1990, Fakhreddin offered it to Teo for S$600,000. Teo asked Abishai Masih (Masih) for a second opinion and was told it was not worth more than S$350,000. Teo eventually bought it for S$375,000. Teo paid Fakhreddin by way of a cheque drawn in favour of Ghassan Abdul Hadi. He accompanied Fakhreddin to cash it. The purchase was for Diamond Centre`s account. The invoice, referred to as `C3`, was sent to him by courier a few days later. It read:

The original certificate was never mailed to Teo. According to Teo, this was not important. Certificates do not tell the value of the jewels. People in the jewellery trade depend on their own experience. Furthermore, if the stone is set, one cannot tell its weight and colour without removing the stone from its setting.
On Fakhreddin`s second trip in February, he brought along a Reza consignment. Fakhreddin consigned it to Teo for three weeks, during which Teo brought them to Brunei. No item was sold because of the high price. According to Teo, he was only insured for S$300,000 even though he said that the Reza consignment was worth US$7m.
Fakhreddin asked Teo to buy something from him, saying that he had spent a lot of money in Singapore. The Rima earrings was the cheapest item at S$850,000. Teo bargained it down to S$450,000. Masih had told him not to pay more than S$370,000. Teo paid in cash, in $10,000 notes. He bought the Rima earrings on his own account as Poon thought they were too expensive. The invoice for this was produced in evidence and is referred to as `C2`. This stated:

Fakhreddin came back to Singapore again in March 1990. Fakhreddin showed Teo a few items but was not prepared to consign them to Teo. Teo bought the Esmerian ruby ring and the Esmerian blue and canary diamond earrings. He paid S$250,000 for the ring and S$450,000 for the earrings. Masih told him that the ruby was only worth S$180,000. Again, the items were bought by Teo for himself as Poon thought they were too expensive. Teo paid in cash.

In every instance, there was correction fluid over the spaces in front of `S$`. The correction fluid covered the letter `U`.
Teo did not think that the invoices had insufficient details even though they were not dated and two of them did not have invoice numbers. He did not notice that Fakhreddin`s name was spelt wrongly on two occasions. The correction fluid marks did not worry him. According to Teo, it was more important whom he was dealing with. On this occasion, Teo also consigned Diamond Centre`s goods to Fakhreddin. Teo did not ask for security.
Around the end of March or early April 1990, Fakhreddin was back in Singapore. He left a big collection of jewellery from Reza on consignment with Teo. Fakhreddin also showed him some sapphires. Teo bought two for S$220,000. There was no invoice for the two sapphires because of the police seizure. Fakhreddin needed a loan for US$1.2m. Teo stood as guarantor for Fakhreddin`s loan from the Republic Bank of New York. If Fakhreddin had defaulted on the loan, Teo would retain the consignment of Reza jewellery left by Fakhreddin. Teo claimed he had to show Fakhreddin the money to gain his confidence. Edery did not come on this trip.
In May 1990, Edery came to collect the consignment of Reza jewellery. Teo told Edery that only Fakhreddin could do so. He told Edery to inform Fakhreddin that if he wanted the goods back, he needed to repay the loan guaranteed by Teo. Teo did not hear from Edery again.
When Teo was in Paris in June 1990, he called Diamond Centre, as was his usual practice. He was informed that Reza, Edery and Fakhreddin had been to Diamond Centre in the morning. The next day, he spoke to Fakhreddin over the phone. Fakhreddin said that US$300,000 worth of Diamond Centre`s goods were sold. Fakhreddin asked Teo to return the Reza consignment to Reza. Teo asked about his guarantee and was told that Reza would take over the guarantee and the money for the sold goods. Reza confirmed this over the phone. Teo told Poon to release two sets of jewellery to Reza. Reza told Teo that, in future, he would deal directly with Teo. The guarantee was transferred in July and Teo returned the goods received from Fakhreddin to Reza.
On or about 7 February 1991, Teo was informed about the police search of Diamond Centre`s premises and the Anton Piller order. According to him, he retrieved the three invoices from the office. Two invoices were in his personal file, which was in the drawer. The third was in Diamond Centre`s file, which was in the cabinet. He went to see his solicitors.
Foo gave evidence in support of Teo`s defence. Foo is a real estate broker. He claimed to be Ong Beng Seng`s `in-house broker`. He also said that he ran errands for Ong Beng Seng. However, he has his own firm. His evidence was that Ong Beng Seng called him to his (Ong Beng Seng`s) office and asked Foo to introduce Fakhreddin to Teo. Foo brought Fakhreddin to Diamond Centre.
In addition, Masih, a diamond and gem merchant, gave evidence that he was approached by Teo for a second opinion on the items Teo bought. Masih`s valuation was lower than what Teo eventually paid. David Tan, the vice president of the Singapore Diamond Exchange, was called by the defence to give expert evidence about the jewellery trade in Singapore.
 The proceedings 
The reliefs sought by RE Inc and Corvina are already stated above. Originally, RE Inc included in its statement of claim a claim for the Wolfers sapphire ring and the Rima emerald earrings. The statement of claim was amended as these items did not belong to RE Inc. After Corvina bought over the rights and interest in the Rima emerald earrings from Rima, Corvina commenced proceedings for them. The two suits were consolidated.
 Swiss law 
The defendants mounted an alternative defence that under Swiss law, property in the jewellery had passed to Fakhreddin. An expert witness on Swiss law was called by each side. The witness for the plaintiffs, Robert Philip Briner, gave evidence that the Wolfers memorandum was a `commission contract`. This is a contract under which the commissionaire undertakes to arrange the sale of movable property in the commissionaire`s own name, but for the account of the principal, to a third party buyer for a commission. Since the commissionaire acts for the account of the principal, he acquires no title.
The expert for the defendants, Michel Amaudruz (Amaudruz), testified that the Wolfers memorandum was a `consignment contract`. This is a contract whereby the consignor undertakes to transfer the goods at a fixed price to the consignee for the consignee to sell to a third party in the consignee`s own name and for the consignee`s own account.
In the case of a consignment contract, the consignment is always for a fixed period of time. In the present case, the deadline was for 15 days. At the end of this period, Fakhreddin had to decide whether to hand back the jewels or pay for them. If he paid for them, he becomes the owner. A problem arises where the consignee makes no choice at the end of the period. This gives rise to a `blocking` situation. It is necessary to terminate the agreement before the consignor can assert an ownership claim against the consignee. Until then, the consignor only has a claim in contract for the price of the goods. In any event, it is not clear whether an action for ownership is possible.
According to Amaudruz, there is a theory by Professor Paul Piotet designed to avoid a blocking situation in 
 Le contrat estimatoire, Ed Stampfli, 
Bern 1967. According to this theory, the consignment contract is a conditional sale which is executed whenever the consignee acquires the property, sells the property to a third party or disposes of the property in violation of his obligations. If one of these events occur, the property passes to the consignee and the consignor can only claim the price.
 The decision below 
The learned judge, after referring to 45 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 1422, was of the view that the present case concerned a branch of conversion involving dealing with someone else`s goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner`s rights. In displaying the jewellery for sale as owners, Teo and Diamond Centre were asserting a right inconsistent with RE Inc and Corvina`s rights. The defence was that Teo had bought the goods in good faith from Fakhreddin. This was of no avail unless the defendants could rely on the Factors Act or the Sale of Goods Act.
The learned judge held that s 9 of the Factors Act and s 25(1) of the Sale of Goods Act did not apply as the goods were consigned to Fakhreddin. He had not bought or agreed to buy them. The goods were only consigned for 15 days. The learned judge relied on 
 Percy Edwards (Ltd) v Vaughan 
 (1910) 26 TLR 545.
As for s 2(1) of the Factors Act, Fakhreddin was a mercantile agent who was in possession with the consent of the owner at the time of the disposition of the jewellery. Even though the consent had lapsed, the disposition would still be valid if the person taking under the disposition had no notice of this, provided he acted in good faith. The burden was on Teo and Diamond Centre to show that they purchased in good faith.
The learned judge was not persuaded that the burden had been discharged. There was no acceptable evidence as to Teo`s source of funds. According to Teo`s account, he would have misappropriated S$1.15m, from a `float fund` for his Brunei principal, to pay for the jewels. There were no accounts kept for the float fund. Teo maintained that his buyers paid attention only to the design of the jewellery and the person they were dealing with. They paid no attention to the size of the stones.
In the learned judge`s view, the invoices were suspicious, especially C1 and C2. The invoices appeared to have been altered. Their contents did not describe adequately the items and in the case of C2, the caratage was wrong. The purchases were at a gross undervalue. No original certificate from a laboratory was handed over. In the learned judge`s view, these would have put any buyer in the trade on notice. More importantly, the learned judge found that Teo was not at all a credible witness. The s 2(1) defence therefore failed.
The learned judge also considered the defendants` Swiss law argument. However, he did not appear to make a finding that Swiss law applied. It appears that he accepted that the lex situs rule does not apply where the person claiming title has not acted bona fide, though it was not clear whether he was referring to Singapore law or Swiss law as the lex situs. The learned judge was of the view that there was no blocking situation as Fakhreddin had in fact elected to return the jewellery by 19 December 1989. Thus Fakhreddin could acquire no title under Swiss law and hence could not confer title on the defendants.
As for the claim for an order that the defendants account, as constructive trustee, for the missing Esmerian jewellery allegedly delivered to Reza, the learned judge was of the view that the description of the items was not adequate to identify them as part of the missing Esmerian jewellery. This claim therefore failed.
 Civil Appeal No 20 of 1996 
In this appeal, Teo and Diamond Centre appealed against the decision below. Although several grounds of appeal were raised in the appellants` case, Mr Elias in his submission informed us that there were really only two live issues. The first is the learned judge`s rejection of the Factors Act defence that the defendants bought the jewellery in good faith from a mercantile agent. This was purely a question of fact. The second ground was that the defendants obtained good title because of the operation of Swiss law.
 Swiss law 
We shall deal with the issue of Swiss law first as this ground can be disposed of easily. Mr Elias submitted that the learned judge was right in accepting Amaudruz`s evidence that the transaction was a consignment contract. His contention was that the learned judge ought not to have accepted that Fakhreddin had elected to return the jewellery by 19 December 1989.
We do not think that Swiss law is applicable at all. The inescapable fact was that the jewellery were in Singapore when Fakhreddin sold them to Teo. It seems to us clear beyond argument that the lex situs was Singapore law. We need only refer to 
 Cammell v Sewell 
 (1860) 5 H & N 728; 
 Janesich v George Attenborough & Son 
 (1910) 26 TLR 278 and 
 Winkworth v Christie Manson and Woods Ltd & Anor 
 (1980) 1 Ch 496.
 Janesich v George Attenborough 
 is directly in point. In that case, the plaintiff, a Parisian jeweller, entrusted a diamond necklace to G for sale in England. The entrustment was subject to French law. In breach of the terms of the entrustment, G pledged the necklace to the defendants in London. The plaintiff sued the defendants for conversion. The plaintiff argued that under French law, the defendants did not get title. It was held that though the contract between the plaintiff and G was governed by French law, the validity of the transaction when G delivered the necklace to the defendants must be governed by English law as it took place in England.
Swiss law is only relevant if it was shown that under Swiss law, Fakhreddin had acquired title to the goods in Switzerland, before he purported to sell them in Singapore to Teo. According to Professor Piotet`s theory, which was advanced by the defendants` expert witness, a consignee acquires the property to the consigned goods in a blocking situation when he either acquires the goods, sells them to a third party, or otherwise disposes of them in breach of his obligation. Fakhreddin did none of these acts while he was in Switzerland. It was only when the seized jewellery were in Singapore that he sold them to Teo. By which time, the lex situs was Singapore law.
Indeed, it was the unanimous opinion of both experts that Singapore law governed the sales to Teo. Amaudruz made no claim in court that property passed to Fakhreddin while the goods were in Switzerland.
We are therefore of the view that this ground of appeal is bound to fail. Hence, it is not necessary for us to decide whether Fakhreddin had elected to return the goods by 19 December 1989.
 The Factors Act defence 
We turn next to the second ground of appeal. Firstly, Mr Elias contended that the jewellery were not purchased at an undervalue. The prices fixed by RE Inc, Corvina and Wolfers were aimed at royalty in the UAE. There was no market price for precious stones, apart from diamonds. The same was true of fancy coloured diamonds. The prices which Teo paid were wholesale prices. By comparing prices charged by Wolfers on consignment with the prices paid by Teo, the learned judge was not comparing like with like.
Secondly, Mr Elias argued that the learned judge did not give any weight to the defence evidence that Fakhreddin was introduced by Foo following a meeting with Ong Beng Seng. The jewellery business is based on trust. This much was accepted by the plaintiffs` witnesses. Teo trusted Fakhreddin.
Next, it was argued that the absence of original certificates was not unusual as that was the custom and practice of the jewellery trade in Singapore. No certificate changes hand when goods are consigned. In fact, it is not controversial that jewellery may be on-sold without the consignee having sight of them. Lastly, it is contended that there was nothing unusual about the invoices.
Before we deal with these points, we have first to consider Mr Low`s argument that there was no credible evidence that Teo bought the jewellery at all. He was thus not a purchaser, much less a bona fide purchaser in good faith.
Mr Low pointed to the very unsatisfactory manner in which Teo gave evidence as to his source of funds. Initially, Teo said that the money came from Citibank in Brunei. When pressed, he revealed that his principal in Brunei left him in charge of a fund of some S$2m for use when the principal comes to Singapore. He added that he kept no accounts as the principal trusted him. According to Teo, he used the money in this fund. He then topped it up from money he obtained when he went to Brunei. When confronted with his passport, which showed that he did not go to Brunei during the relevant time, he admitted that he did not top up the money. He immediately changed tack and said that the money was a loan from his Brunei principal. In re-examination, he shifted his ground once more and said that they had been set off against purchases from him.
In the circumstances, Mr Low submitted that the trial judge made no finding that Teo bought the jewellery. We do not agree with this submission. It seems to us that the learned judge had impliedly accepted, or was prepared to accept, that Teo did pay for the jewellery. Had it been otherwise, he would not have dealt with the issue of bona fide. If there was no finding that Teo bought the jewellery, that would have been the end of the matter. The defendants would not have discharged the burden of proving that they were purchasers.
The learned judge was, however, not satisfied with the evidence given by Teo as to his source of funds. That evidently contributed to how he assessed Teo`s credibility. This is an altogether different matter with which we shall deal with later. In the event, we are not prepared to say that the defendants have not satisfied the trial judge that the jewellery were purchased by them. We will deal with the appeal on the basis that they did purchase the jewellery from Fakhreddin.
The first issue is the prices paid for the items. While it is true that there can be a wide spread between retail and trade prices for the seized jewellery, the evidence showed that the prices paid by Teo for the jewellery, except for the Wolfers sapphire ring and the Rima emerald earrings, were lower even than what Esmerian paid for the stones alone several years before.
The Burma ruby in the Esmerian ruby ring was purchased by Esmerian in 1980 for US$365,000. Teo claimed to have bought it in 1990 for S$250,000, which was approximately US$132,275 at 1990 rates. Granted, Esmerian had the stone recut so that the size was slightly reduced, but it was still a very low price.
The six blue and canary diamonds alone cost Esmerian US$334,505 when purchased over a period of years from 1980. Teo bought the whole pair of earrings for S$450,000, which was roughly US$238,100. Very tellingly, when David Tan, the defendant`s own expert witness, was shown the invoice for this, he thought that Teo had bought 14 stones. The price suggested to him that the stones were about one carat each. A bigger stone is worth more per carat. In the present case, the smallest diamond was a 1.47 carat flawless blue diamond. Four of the six were larger than three carats each. The undervalue is evident.
The larger of the Esmerian sapphires cost US$160,000 in 1976. Teo bought this, together with the smaller one, for S$220,000 (approximately US$116,500). As for the Wolfers sapphire ring, Teo himself offered it for S$1.5m and provided security for it at US$600,000.
There is only hearsay from Guillaume as to how much the Rima emerald earrings cost Rima. Nevertheless, the figure of US$196,735 was accepted by Mr Elias, no doubt because it did not suggest substantial undervalue. Teo bought them for S$450,000, which was roughly US$238,095. However, we are of the view that this purchase must be viewed in the light of all the other transactions. The overall picture was one of substantial undervalue.
We could not accept the argument that Teo bought at these prices because the market for such high-priced goods are limited in Singapore. Fakhreddin was a foreigner. That he brought such goods to a place where there is a limited market for them, to sell at a lower price than what he could have got elsewhere, would have put any prudent businessman on notice. It is inconceivable that Teo, being in the jewellery trade, and according to him, doing substantial business, would not have known that the prices commanded by such items in other more established markets would be much higher than what he paid for them.
On the contrary, common business sense would suggest that he knew that the jewels were offered to him at a low price. That was why, despite there being a limited market for such goods, he purchased them, either on his own or on behalf of Diamond Centre. This is also consistent with his admission that he rarely bought precious stones for his business. In purchasing the jewellery, he was at best taking a calculated business risk. The fact that he could not sell the jewellery for about a year was neither here nor there, as there was a limited market in Singapore.
We now turn to the invoices. There were no doubts irregularities in them. The jewellery in some of them were not described properly. The Esmerian blue and canary diamond earrings were described in a manner which suggested that they were loose stones, when it was Teo`s evidence that they were bought as a pair of earrings, which Teo dismantled. There was no mention of the 108 pink diamonds. The size of the diamonds in the Esmerian ruby ring was stated wrongly. The same was true of the Esmerian emerald earrings. Apart from this, Fakhreddin`s name was twice spelt wrongly. The invoices were undated and two of them had no invoice numbers. The letter `U` before the prices was covered by correction fluid.
Nevertheless, we are not persuaded that these irregularities by themselves would necessarily have put a purchaser on notice. The description of the jewellery in the invoices as compared with those in the jewellery trade appears generally to be brief. With respect to the learned judge, we do not agree that they can be compared to the detailed descriptions found in a Sotheby`s auction catalogue. The two serve wholly different purposes. Neither was it suspicious that Fakhreddin`s name was spelt wrongly. The evidence showed that Fakhreddin was in the habit of spelling his name in slightly different manners. This could well be because of his difficulty with written English and French. We note however that there was no explanation why there was no invoice for the Esmerian sapphires.
The errors in the description of the sizes of some of the stones would, of course, not have put Teo on notice. The stones were mounted. Unless they are weighed, the exact size would not be known. This, however, suggests the importance of laboratory certificates, which we shall now deal with.
We accept that when jewellery are consigned, laboratory certificates are not necessary. However, the expert evidence from both sides was that when jewellery of this quality are sold to retail customers, it is expected that they will ask for these certificates. Hence, retail sellers would usually ask for certificates. In the present case, Teo was not a consignee of the jewellery. He was a purchaser, and he bought them with a view to selling to retail customers. There was no reason not to ask for a certificate. At the very least, it would have saved the purchaser the cost of having it re-certificated, as well as the freight and insurance involved in sending the jewel to the laboratory. It is a reasonable inference that certificates were not important because the jewellery were offered at a very low price.
There is yet another reason why laboratory certificates are necessary. This is the advent of man-made and enhanced gems. The prices for these are significantly below the price of natural ones. The evidence was that it is not always the case that the two can be distinguished even by the trained eye. Laboratory certificates are therefore indispensable, especially for such high priced stones which are set.
Even if we do not go into this, it was accepted at a rather basic level that the difference in prices between a flawless stone and one with very small incisions, such as a VVS1, is quite substantial. However, the difference can often not be seen even by the trained eye, especially when the stone is mounted. This is an additional reason for laboratory certificates. We note that two of the coloured diamonds, including a 3.25 carat yellow diamond, are internally flawless. It only serves to illustrate the importance of certificates, unless prices are very low.
Furthermore, Teo was supplied with a copy of the laboratory certificate when he purchased the Wolfers sapphire ring. The evidence was that where a copy of the laboratory certificate is shown to a potential buyer, it is expected that the original is delivered upon purchase. According to Teo, he asked for the original certificate. We are of the view that the failure by Fakhreddin to deliver the original certificate to Teo ought to have put Teo on notice. At the very least, it would have a significant impact on the question of trust, which was one of the cornerstones of the defendants` case.
Turning to the question of trust itself, we are of the view that there was little merit in the argument that Teo trusted Fakhreddin. Even if we accept the defence`s version of how Teo met Fakhreddin (the learned judge apparently did not), we cannot see how this could be the basis of a trusting relationship to the extent contended by Teo. Assuming that Fakhreddin was referred to Teo by Ong Beng Seng, the basis for the introduction was simply that Fakhreddin had offered to sell Ong Beng Seng some jewellery and Ong Beng Seng referred him to Teo because he (Ong Beng Seng) did not wish to buy any. Likewise, the so-called reference from the Hour Glass was simply that Fakhreddin had consigned carpets and jewellery to them, but that they had never transacted any business with him. The Hour Glass did not even bother to show the jewellery to any one.
Even David Tan had to concede that trust in the jewellery business was built up over a period of years. The transactions in which the defendants bought the jewellery took place within a matter of months from the time Fakhreddin met Teo. The first purchase, of the Wolfers sapphire ring, was within days. If the defendant`s version of how they met Fakhreddin is rejected, there is even less ground on which to say that Teo trusted Fakhreddin. Fakhreddin was just a foreigner who had walked into Diamond Centre`s shop.
Lastly, we deal with the most difficult obstacle for the defendants to overcome, and that is the finding of fact by the learned judge that Teo was not a credible witness. The principles followed by an appellate court when dealing with a trial judge`s finding of facts were reiterated recently by this court in 
 Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 305
. There is no need to repeat them here.
Having gone through the transcript of evidence carefully, we are of the view that the learned judge was entitled to come to the conclusion that Teo was not a credible witness. Teo`s testimony was full of contradictions and he shifted his ground often. We have already mentioned how he changed his evidence about his source of funds. We recite a few more instances in which his evidence was less than satisfactory.
In relation to his profit margin, which had a material bearing on the question of undervalue, he first said that his margin was sometimes more than 50%, sometimes less, and sometimes at a loss. Shortly after saying this, he claimed that jewellers have margins of 200% to 500%, with a minimum of 200%.
On the one hand, he claimed or tried to convey the impression that Poon, who holds 97.5% of Diamond Centre`s shares, as someone who merely looks after the shop, opens the doors in the morning and locks them at night. On the other hand, his evidence was that he had to defer to Poon`s view when Poon thought that some of the jewellery were too expensive.
Teo was prepared to furnish security for the Wolfers sapphire ring for US$600,000. He offered it to his principal client for S$1.5m. Yet, he testified that it was worth no more than S$375,000. His answer was simply that he would only get a second opinion on the value of an item if he was buying it.
Lastly, according to Teo, Diamond Centre`s turnover for the previous year was over S$40m. His own private business was `much larger`. Yet, his income for 1993 was only S$980,000, which must be quite remarkable considering the margins he claimed to enjoy. For 1990, his personal turnover was around S$30m. His income tax was only S$200,000, and that was from Diamond Centre`s profits. Teo said that his business was done overseas out of Hong Kong. However, he does not pay tax in Hong Kong. Strangely enough, he does not issue invoices for sale of jewellery, but Diamond Centre issues them when it sells gold items.
Mr Elias was forced to concede that Teo`s testimony was `cavalier`. The learned judge evidently thought that it went beyond that. We are not in a position to disagree with the learned judge. On the contrary, we agree with his findings.
The defence of bona fide purchase from a mercantile agent under s 2(1) of the Factors Act was based entirely on Teo`s evidence. This evidence was found not to be credible. This by itself, would have been fatal to the defendants` case. We agree with the learned judge that the defendants have not discharged the burden of proving that they are bona fide purchasers of the items of jewellery seized by the police and belonging to the plaintiffs.
 Civil Appeal No 25 of 1996 
In the cross-appeal by RE Inc, Mr Low argued that the learned judge ought to have found that there was a constructive trust in favour of RE Inc over part of the jewellery delivered to Reza. The argument was that since there were only four items of jewellery from the Reza consignment in the hands of Teo when Teo purported to hand over 11 items of jewellery, it follows that seven of these items must be part of the Esmerian jewellery. The argument was premised on the basis that Fakhreddin did not have any other source of jewellery.
We cannot accept this argument. There was no credible evidence that jewellery in Fakhreddin`s hands must come either from Reza or RE Inc. Mr Low relied solely on Edery`s evidence that the last Reza consignment was the only consignment taken by Fakhreddin without his knowledge. However, this was a bare allegation. Edery could not know. Guillaume gave evidence that some consignments came from Wolfers, as well as Horovitz & Totah, though the latter is hearsay. Nevertheless, it is not hearsay that not all the jewellery handed to Fakhreddin by Wolfers were from RE Inc. Guillaume knew which jewellery he handed to Fakhreddin on Wolfers` behalf were from RE Inc.
On the evidence before us, it is impossible to hold, even if any adverse inference is drawn against Teo for not calling Poon or Yap, that the jewellery handed over to Reza must be part of the Esmerian jewellery. It remains to be said that, in any event, we are not persuaded that such an adverse inference ought to be drawn.
We therefore agree with the learned judge that there was inadequate identification of the subject matter of the alleged constructive trust. Accordingly, we dismiss RE Inc`s appeal.
 Conclusion 
In the event, both Civil Appeal No 20 of 1996 and Civil Appeal No 25 of 1996 are dismissed with costs. We direct that the appeal deposit in Civil Appeal No 20 of 1996 be paid out to the respondents in that appeal or to their solicitors to account of the respondents` costs and that the appeal deposit in Civil Appeal No 25 of 1996 be paid out to the appellants or their solicitors.

The appellant was charged as follows :
 
You, Teo Geok Fong (NRIC No. 1290541/F) of 39 Victoria Park Road,Singapore, are charged that on the 12th day of June 1995 at or about 10.40 amat Leonie Hill, #16-03, Horizon Tower West, Singapore, you did voluntarilycause hurt to Lim Eng Hock (NRIC No. 0004578/J) of 29 Leonie Hill, #16-03,Horizon Tower West, Singapore, by slapping him on his left cheek, and you havethereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code,Cap 225 (1985 Rev. Ed.)
 
 
 
In the court below, the appellant was found guilty, convicted andfined$300, in default of payment, one week`s imprisonment. The appellant paidthe fine and appealed against her conviction. At the end of the hearing, I wasof the view that although the appellant was guilty of the offence,nevertheless I would allow the appeal and set aside the conviction for thefollowing reasons.
 Background facts 
This matter arose in the wake of a matrimonial dispute betweenthe twoparties, who are husband and wife. As such, I saw it fit to relate thebackground facts to this matter in order to give a more complete account tothe whole story.
The parties were married with two children, a daughter Lim HweeLi agedfour, and a son Lim Wee Kiat aged two. Subsequently the marriage turned sourand led to a series of events culminating in this incident. On 26 April 1995the respondent (who was the complainant in this case) obtained an ex parteorder for the sole custody, care and control of the children. To date, thismatter continues to be hotly contested.
Whilst the matrimonial dispute was pending, the appellant allegedthatthe respondent had assaulted her. The appellant then obtained a medical reportof the injuries sustained by her from the assault and based on this, wasgranted an expedited personal protection order on 9 May 1995 by thesubordinate courts. Apparently, on 22 May 1995, the police were called as theappellant required assistance to prevent another assault against her, thistime by her mother-in-law. Presently, the appellant is living with hersister.
On 1 June 1995, the High Court granted both parties joint custodyof thechildren in the interim. Meanwhile, a number of private summonses andcross-summonses had been taken out by the parties against each other in thesubordinate courts. This incident of voluntarily causing hurt was thesubject-matter of one of the private summonses taken out by the respondentalleging that the appellant had slapped him on his left cheek. I shall nowturn to the events as they were narrated by the parties.
 The respondent`s version ofevents 
The respondent gave evidence that on 12 June 1995, at about 10.10am,his wife, the appellant, returned to the matrimonial home at 29 Leonie Hill,#16-03, Horizon Tower West with her nephew, Low Leong Cheng (Low). Therespondent did not know the reason for her return to the flat.
Without taking off their shoes or greeting the respondent as theyentered the flat, the appellant and Low proceeded towards therespondent`s mother`s room. Using a ladder which was obtained fromthe family area, and upon the appellant`s instructions, Low retrievedcertain items from the cupboards in the room. Meanwhile the respondent broughtin his camera and started taking photographs of the activities of theappellant and Low.
At the same time the respondent told Low that if anything wentmissing,he would report Low to the police. At this juncture the appellant interjected,saying `Don`t worry, he can`t touch me, I would put him injail`. The respondent thought that the appellant was referring to thepersonal protection order which she had obtained. The respondent`smother was in the room and she heard the appellant utter `rotten man,rotten woman` in Hokkien.
The appellant and Low then proceeded to the study room, themasterbedroom and the children`s room to retrieve more things. As they weremoving from the study room to the master bedroom, the appellant paused tospeak to the children. Low started to gather the things which he and theappellant had retrieved and brought them to the lift lobby.
Whilst the appellant was passing by the family area towards theliftlobby, she paused for a moment to hug her son. All this while, the respondenthad been following her around, taking snapshots of her activities in the flat.The appellant then moved towards the lift lobby to wait for the lift. Therespondent was standing in the family area, about six to seven feet away fromthe appellant and wanted to take a picture of the items that were taken out tothe lift lobby. At the same time, the respondent was holding on to hisdaughter.
Suddenly, the appellant lunged forward, swung her right hand attherespondent and slapped him on his left cheek. The respondent turned away butcould not avoid the slap. He lost his balance and dropped the camera, butfortunately he did not drop his daughter as she had clung on tightly to him.The appellant was allegedly heard to say `You dare not even touch me. Iwill put you in jail. I don`t even have to go to court to put you injail`.
After this, the appellant went back to the lift lobby and whenthe liftarrived, her nephew loaded the things into the lift and they left. Accordingto the respondent, he managed to take a picture of the appellant coming at himjust before the slap was executed. This photograph was tendered and admittedin the court below as an exhibit.
The slapping incident was also witnessed by therespondent`smother, Thng Goon See, and the maid. According to the respondent`smother, she was standing in the family area behind the respondent but facingin the direction of the lift. She saw the appellant slap the respondent on hisleft cheek and, after the assault, saw the camera flung towards herdirection.
The maid further testified that she was standing in the familyarea withthe respondent`s son beside her, when the incident occurred. Shewitnessed the appellant slapping the respondent on his left cheek and therewas a flash of light from the camera before the slap was given. At the sametime, the respondent was holding on to his daughter. She also heard theappellant uttering some words to the respondent but did not understand whatthey were.
 The appellant`s version ofevents 
The appellant deposed that she had returned to the matrimonialhome on12 June 1995 to retrieve some of her belongings. Her nephew came to assist heras she was suffering from a back injury and was unable to climb a ladder orcarry heavy loads. She had an appointment with the doctors` that morningand she decided to pick up her belongings on her way there.
Just as she was in her mother-in-law`s room, the respondentstarted taking photographs. She denied threatening the respondent as healleged. Instead, when the respondent had threatened to report her nephew tothe police for coming to the flat to steal his things, she told her nephew toignore the respondent as he just wanted to irritate her and was up to nogood.
Having gathered her belongings, the appellant saw hermother-in-law inthe family area and the latter scolded her in Hokkien saying `rottenwoman`. The appellant then uttered the very same words back at hermother-in-law to voice her sentiments. As she was leaving the flat, she pausedby at the family area to hug both her children who were then standing on achair in the family area.
The appellant`s nephew was already at the lift lobby withherbelongings. The appellant then proceeded to the lift lobby and waited for thelift to arrive. The appellant claimed that she was facing her nephew at thelift lobby and her back was towards the family area. During cross-examinationhowever, the appellant clarified that whilst she was waiting for the lift, shehad moved into the family area. Both her children were at the chair beside theglass door of the home.
As the children were crying, she turned around to take a look atthem.As she turned around, she saw a camera directly in front of her and she wasstartled. She let out a scream and swung her right hand outwards in aclockwise direction to avoid the camera. The appellant denied that she hit therespondent on his face as the camera was in front of him. However, she was notsure whether she had hit the camera when she swung her hand outwards, aseverything happened so quickly.
After that, there was a flash from the camera, the respondentretreatedand the camera fell to the floor on his left hand side. As the respondent hadbeen following her around taking photographs, she felt frustrated andirritated. Hence, without further ado, she turned around and left with hernephew when the lift came.
As they were leaving, the respondent uttered to the nephewsaying,`I will bring you to court, you come to my house to steal things`.The appellant maintained that both the children were all along beside thechair near the glass door in the family area and that the respondent was notcarrying their daughter when the incident happened. The appellant denied thatafter the incident, she had said to the respondent, `You dare not eventouch me. I will put you in jail. I don`t even have to go to court toput you in jail`.
The appellant`s nephew`s evidence was in tandem withhertestimony. According to him, he had gone to the lift lobby with some boxescontaining the appellant`s personal belongings and was waiting for thelift. Suddenly, he heard the appellant scream, and he turned around. He sawthe appellant`s right hand flung outwards. The respondent then steppedback, there was a flash and the camera fell onto the floor. When all thesehappened, the appellant was about two arms` length from the respondentand the respondent was not carrying his daughter.
 The trial judge`sdecision 
The trial judge`s decision hinged mainly on the evaluationof thephotograph which had been taken by the respondent. The appellant claimed thatshe had swung her right hand outwards as she turned around to face therespondent and had swept her right hand from her left to her right to avoidthe camera. In turn, the respondent claimed that in executing the slap, theappellant had swung her right hand from her right to her left. He maintainedthat the photograph captured the moment just before the execution of the slapwhereas the appellant stated that the photograph captured the moment after shehad swung her hand out. Thus the two versions were diametricallyopposed.
A look at the photograph showed that the appellant was in verycloseproximity to the camera. From the photograph, it can be seen that the focalpoint was not on the appellant but on her nephew in the background who wasstanding at the lift lobby with some boxes. The nephew and the surroundingobjects appeared in sharp focus. In the foreground was the appellant`sfigure. The burst of light, evidently from the flash fell mainly on theappellant who appeared ashen as she stood very close to the source of light.From the photograph, the trial judge came to the conclusion that therespondent`s version of events was true. He reasoned as follows :
 
If the Defendant`s [Appellant`s] version is true that sheswung her hand to avoid the camera then there would have been camera shake asshe would have made contact with the camera and there would not have been suchquality of picture as appears in the print. Further to avoid the camera, itwould be more natural for her to use her right palm to push the camera awayand not the back of her hand.
 
 
 
If the Defendant`s [Appellant`s] version that she hasturnedaround in clockwise to face the Complainant [Respondent] is true, then herhandbag that was slung from the right shoulder would not have remained stuckto the right side of her body as it appears in exhibit `P4` [thephotograph]. If she had turned right around at 180Ã», her hair will also beswinging towards her left side of her head as she turned right round in aclockwise direction. But in the photograph, her hair was seen to be on theright side of the head even though she maintained that she had turned rightround. All these features are more consistent with the snapshot being taken atthe moment just before the Defendant executed the slap. And because theComplainant was standing in close proximity to the Defendant, he was in aposition where he could be slapped by the Defendant, inescapably. The positionof the camera after it was dropped is also consistent with theComplainant`s version that when he was struck by the Defendant he wentoff balance, and bent to the other side dropping the camera to the left to hisoriginal position. I do not think the 
 deminimis 
rule is applicable in this case.
However, there is one unsatisfactory feature in theComplainant`sversion. According to the Complainant he was carrying his daughter, Lim HweeLi, at the time the snapshot was taken. The Complainant had given full detailson how the snapshot was taken while he was carrying his daughter in front ofhim. He said he was holding the camera with both hands. Being a left-hander,he held the camera by the left hand and he used the right hand to guide it. Hebrought the view finder of the camera to his right eye to focus the shot andused his right finger to press the shutter button. Meanwhile, his four yearold daughter was carried in front of him with both her hands round his neck,with the head of the daughter at a position below his neck and towards theright side of his body. If that is the case, it will be very difficult for himto look through the view finder with his right eye, as the head of thedaughter will be in the way of the right hand, and for the right finger toreach out to the shutter button of the camera held in the vertical position,in order for the snapshot in exhibit `P4` to be taken in thevertical format.
As such, the trial judge found that the appellant and her nephewweretelling the truth when they said that the respondent was not carrying hisdaughter at the time of the incident. However, for the reasons given above,the trial judge did not believe the appellant when she said that she did notslap the respondent. On the contrary, he accepted the respondent`sevidence that he was slapped by the appellant and as a result, bent to oneside and dropped his camera.
The trial judge was of the view that although the respondent hadliedthat he was carrying his daughter at the time of the incident, he did notthink that the whole of his evidence ought to be rejected. In the trialjudge`s own words,
 
It seemed likely that the respondent was trying to make capital of theslapping incident with the embellishment that he was carrying his daughter tofurther his cause in the pending matter of custody of the two children in theHigh Court.
 
 
 
Thus, the appellant was found to be guilty of the charge andfined $300.
 The appeal 
In this appeal, counsel for the appellant essentially raised thefollowing matters. First, it was contended that the trial judge had erred inlaw in relying on the testimonies of the respondent and his mother althoughthe trial judge had found that they had lied about certain matters.
Next, it was argued that the trial judge had erred in fact infindingthat the appellant had in fact executed the slap having regard to the absenceof any medical evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that a slap wassuffered by the appellant. Moreover, the trial judge erred in finding as afact that the appellant could have lunged forward with her outstretched armacross a distance of approximately seven feet to hit the respondent.
Finally, it was contended that, assuming the appellant was foundto havehit the respondent, the trial judge had erred in deciding that the deminimisprinciple did not apply in the circumstances.
Having perused the evidence before me, I was of the view that thetrialjudge had not erred in law nor in fact in finding that the appellant hadslapped the respondent, and I was satisfied that the prosecution had provenits case beyond reasonable doubt. As a general principle, an appellate courtwill not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against theweight of the evidence. The appellate court should always bear in mind, inexamining the evidence, that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses andhas to pay due regard to the trial judge`s findings and reasons therefor- 
 Lim Ah Poh v PP 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
.
The main part of the appeal and indeed the trial below focused o nwhether the appellant did or did not slap the respondent. The truth in turndepended mainly on the evidence of the appellant against that of therespondent, and on the photograph. Both parties had witnesses to corroboratetheir testimonies but it was clear that the respondent`s mother and themaid were siding with the respondent for their own personal reasons, and theappellant`s nephew was obviously giving evidence in favour of theappellant. Moreover, the whole incident must be scrutinised in the light ofthe ongoing battle for custody of the two children in the High Court.
On the face of the evidence, I had no doubt that the appellantdid slapthe respondent. This was borne out by the photograph. It was not disputed thatthe photograph was taken around the time of the incident. The appellantalleged that it was taken just after she swung her hands at the respondent,whereas the respondent alleged that it was taken just before the appellantslapped him.
If the appellant was to be believed, then the photograph wouldnot haveturned out the way it did. It was the appellant`s evidence that she hadturned round from her right hand side, screamed when she saw the appellantwith the camera just in front of her and swung her right hand out. She thensaw the respondent take a step back and the camera dropped to the floor. Allthese happened very quickly.
The trial judge had noted that the respondent was standing incloseproximity to the appellant and that he was in a position where he could beslapped by the appellant. I could not find any reason to disagree with thelearned judge, nor was his reasoning inherently incredible. The estimation ofhow far the appellant was from the respondent prior to the slap varied fromsix to eight feet. It should be remembered that as this was merely anestimation, room must be given for some degree of error or misjudgment. Assuch, I stressed that undue emphasis should not be p laced on the precisedistance the appellant was from the respondent and whether she took a step, alunge or both.
It was clear from the photograph that the appellant was standinginclose proximity to the respondent. As such, the trial judge was entitled tocome to the conclusion that she would have come into contact with therespondent. This was evidenced by the fact that the respondent retreated afterthe appellant had swung her right hand out, and this fact was admitted by theappellant herself. Moreover, it was not possible for the appellant not to havetouched the respondent or the camera. If there had been no contact with therespondent, he would not have lost his balance, stepped backward and droppedhis camera.
If the photograph had been taken after the incident occurred, thecamerawould have shaken and the photograph would have turned out to be a blur. Thiswas not so. In fact, the photograph showed a clear picture of the incident,and the appellant`s nephew and the objects in the background werecaptured in sharp focus.
I examined the photograph with great care and found a ratherpuzzlingfeature. It did not depict a woman who looked as if she had screamed orsuffered from a shock. It should be remembered that the appellant said thateverything had happened so quickly. If so, there would have been an expressionof surprise or shock on her face after the photograph was taken, if theappellant`s story was to be believed. Instead, the expression on herface showed a tight-lipped woman who was annoyed, angry or irritated; and itshowed that she was about to hit someone with her hand which had been swungforward. In my view, her facial expression gave the game away.
I had no doubt that the appellant did intend to slap therespondent. Shehad admitted that she was irritated and annoyed with him for following heraround the matrimonial home and taking pictures of her activities whil st shewas removing her belongings from the home. This was in the midst of a custodyand matrimonial dispute and both parties were clearly not on good terms. Assuch, what probably transpired was that at the last moment, when the appellantwas waiting for the lift, she was fed-up with the respondent for persisting inhis photo-taking, and her annoyance and anger manifested itself in a slap onthe appellant`s left cheek.
In addition, it should be noted that the fact that the respondenthadnot produced any medical evidence of the hurt caused to him by the slap is, inthis particular case, immaterial. Although it may be desirable to obtain amedical report to corroborate the respondent`s testimony that hurt hadbeen sustained, it was not detrimental in this case where he failed to do so.The trial judge had found as a fact that the appellant had slapped therespondent. I found no reason to disagree with the trial judge`sfinding. Thus he was entitled to infer that hurt had been caused to him.Moreover, the pain and hurt caused may have been minor and insufficient towarrant any medical attention.
Turning then to the question of whether the trial judge had erredin lawin relying on the testimony of the respondent and his mother despitedisbelieving part of their evidence. It has been decided in
 PP v Somwang Phatannasaeng 
[1992] 1 SLR 138
 and again in 
 Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP 
[1995] 3 SLR 701
 that in the context of impeachment of a witness`credibility, the mere fact that the credit of a witness had been impeached didnot necessarily mean that all his evidence would be disregarded. The courtwould still have to scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine what wastrue and which aspects should be disregarded. A fortiori, where the credit ofa witness had not been impeached, as in the present case, the same rules wouldapply.
In PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No2)
[1977] 1 MLJ 15
, Raja Azlan Shah FJ (as he then was) stated as follows:
 
There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either bebelieve in its entirety or not at all. A court is fully competent, for goodand cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and toreject the other. It is, therefore, necessary to scrutinize each evidence verycarefully as this involves the question of weight to be given to certainevidence in particular circumstances.
 
 
 
Again, in 
 Khoon Chye Hin v PP 
[1961] 27MLJ 105, Thomson CJ said:
 
If a witness demonstrably tells lies on one or two points then it isclear that he is not a reliable witness and as a matter of prudence the restof his evidence must be scrutinised with great care and indeed with suspicion.To say, however, that because a witness has been proved a liar on one or twopoints then the whole of his evidence `must in law be rejected` isto go too far and is wrong.
 
 
 
These two cases were subsequently approved of by FA Chua J in
 Samad bin Kamis & Anor v PP 
 [1992] 1 SLR340.
In the present case, I was satisfied that the trial judge hadmade noerror of law in relying on the testimonies of the respondent and his mother onthe incident, although he found as a fact that they had lied about certainmatters. As the trial judge had the benefit of observing the demeanour of thewitnesses, and had given careful consideration to their evidence as a whole, Iwas reluctant to disturb his findings of fact.
I now turn to the point of whether the trial judge should haveappliedthe de minimis principle to this matter. The starting point is s 95 of thePenal Code (Cap 224) which states:
 
Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intendedto c ause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm isso slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of suchharm.
 
 
 
This provision is adopted from s 95 of the Indian Penal Code,which isin parimateria to the Singapore provision. What then, is the scope of s 95 ofthe Penal Code? At the outset it should be noted that s 95 would have noapplication, unless the act in question amounts to an offence under the PenalCode. This, of course, does not mean that, where an offence does not fallwithin the Penal Code, a similar principle could not apply, for s 95 merelyenshrines the general maxim de minimis non curat lex (the law does not takeaccount of trivialities).
The authors of Ratanlal and Dhirajlal`s
 Lawof Crimes 
(at pp 269-270) explained that the purpose and ambit of s 95 ofthe Indian Penal Code were as follows:
 
The authors of the Code observe: `Clause 73 (this section) isintended to provide for those cases which, though, from the imperfections oflanguage, they fall within the letter of the penal law, are yet not within itsspirit, and are all over the world considered by the public, and for the mostpart dealt with by the tribunals, as innocent. As our definitions are framed,it is theft to dip a pen in another man`s ink, mischief to crumble oneof his wafers, an assault to cover him with a cloud of dust by riding parthim, hurt to incommode him by pressing against him in getting into a carriage.There are innumerable acts without performing which men cannot live togetherin society, acts which all men constantly do and suffer in turn, and which itis desirable that they should do and suffer in turn, yet which differ only indegree from crimes. That these acts ought not to be treated as crimes isevident, and we think it far better expressly to except them from the penalclauses of the Code than to leave it to the judges to except these c ases onlyby resorting to one of two practices which we consider as most pernicious, bymaking law, or by wresting the language of the law from its plainmeaning`.
 
 
 
Thus, s 95 provides relief to an offender where the act isnegligible orthe offence is of a trivial character. Moreover, from a plain reading of thesection, it applies not only where the harm caused was accidental but wherethe act was deliberate. The section would apply if the act causes harm or isintended to cause harm or is known to be likely to cause harm, provided theharm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complainof such harm.
The expression `harm` has not been defined in thePenalCode. I think that the word should be given its ordinary meaning. In the newShorter Oxford English Dictionary, `harm` connotes grief, sorrow,hurt, injury, damage or mischief. Thus, the expression emcompasses bothphysical and non-physical injury as well as financial loss and loss ofreputation. This is borne out by the fact that the expression`harm` is used in the Penal Code in more than one sense. Forinstance in ss 81, 87, 88 and 100 as well as the sections dealing withoffences against the person under Chapter XVI of the Penal Code,`harm` connotes physical injury. In s 415, `harm`means injury to a person in body, mind, reputation or property.
As such, there is nothing in s 95 which warrants that arestrictedmeaning should be attributed to that word. Section 95 is a general exception,and if that expression has in many other sections dealing with generalexceptions a wide connotation, then s 95 should be given the wide and variedmeanings which the word is given in the other sections under the PenalCode.
The next question is whether, having regard to the circumstances,theharm caused to the appellant was so slight that no person of ordina ry senseand temper would complain of such harm. In 
 Veeda Menezesv Yusuf Khan 
AIR 1966 SC 1773, the Indian Supreme Court stated the factors to beconsidered as follows:
 
The section is intended to prevent penalisation of negligible wrongs orof offences of trivial character. Whether an act which amounts to an offenceis trivial would depend upon the nature of the injury, the position of theparties, the knowledge or intention with which the offending act is done, andthe related circumstances. There can be no absolute standard or degree of harmwhich may be regarded as so slight that a person of ordinary sense and temperwould not complain of the harm. It cannot be judged solely by the measure ofphysical or other injury the act causes.
 
 
 
Moreover, the person of ordinary sense and temper must beadjudged fromthe class to which the complainant belongs.
On the present facts, I was of the view that the harm caused totherespondent by a mere slap was so slight that a person of ordinary sense andtemper and in the position of the respondent would not complain of such harm.The evidence justified this conclusion. It was a mere single slap. Therespondent had not shown that there was any sign of a scratch or even a markon his left cheek and he had not bothered to seek medical attention. Thus theinjury must have been minor.
The circumstances which led to the incident should also be takenintoconsideration. The parties were in a midst of a matrimonial dispute in theHigh Court. Tensions were running high and, as the trial judge noted, theywere incommunicado. Moreover, the respondent was in part to blame for theincident. He had, to a certain extent, annoyed and provoked the appellant byfollowing her around the flat and taking photographs of her movements up tothe point when she was leaving the flat and waiting at the lift lobby.
Thus, on the particular facts it would not be in the interest ofjusticeto penalise the appellant for what, in my opinion, was a negligible wrong.Although the appellant was clearly guilty of the offence, I would apply the deminimis principle under s 95 of the Penal Code. Accordingly, I allowed theappeal, set aside the conviction and ordered that the fine paid by theappellant be refunded to her.
Lastly, I would like to stress that the result was confined tothespecial facts of this particular case and I would issue a stern warning toboth parties to behave themselves in future. Section 95 of the Penal Code isnot an exception to be used by one party in a domestic dispute or in any othercontext to abuse the other in the hope that he or she may be excused byinvoking this provision.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was convicted by a district judge on a charge under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) of knowingly furnishing false information to a police officer, in that he fabricated a story that he had been a victim of an armed robbery. He was sentenced to two months` imprisonment. He now appeals against his conviction and sentence.
 The prosecution`s case 
On 15 March 1995, at about 1.44pm, the appellant went to the Tampines East Neighbourhood Police Post located at Block 263 Tampines Street 21, Singapore. Corporal Chew Soon Chee (Cpl Chew), at that time a police constable, was on duty at the police post. The appellant told Cpl Chew that he had been the victim of an armed robbery. He described how at about 1.15pm that day, while in a lift at Block 297 Tampines Street 22, he had been robbed by two male Chinese, one of whom wielded a knife. The appellant described both his assailants as being about 30 years of age and wearing light blue-coloured jumper shirts at the time of the robbery. He believed that his assailants were Malaysians. They took his Seiko watch and $2,800 in cash. Cpl Chew immediately informed the Divisional Operations Room of the armed robbery and recorded the information furnished by the appellant in the police post`s station diary.
A short while later, one Sergeant Mohd Ariffin (Sgt Ariffin) arrived at the police post. He brought the appellant to the scene of the robbery, Block 297. At about 2.10pm, the investigating officer, one Corporal Lee Eng Choon (Cpl Lee) met Sgt Ariffin and the appellant at Block 297. Several other officers also arrived at the scene of the crime to conduct enquiries.
It turned out that, because there had been a recent spate of snatch thefts in Tampines Housing Estate, there were teams of officers from Bedok Police Station which had been deployed to patrol the estate on a regular basis. These were known as `ambush` teams. Cpl Lee contacted the officer who was in charge of the `ambush` team responsible for patrolling Blocks 295 to 297 at the time when the alleged robbery took place. The officer told Cpl Lee that his `ambush` team had in fact been at Block 297 at about 1.30pm, shortly after the time when the robbery allegedly took place, and the officers had not observed any commotion or anything unusual.
Cpl Lee also directed some officers to make enquiries amongst the residents in that area, especially those who had been seated at the void decks of Block 297 and the neighbouring blocks at the material time. It appeared that nobody had seen or heard anything out of the ordinary. No one had noticed any person who fit the appellant`s description of his robbers in the vicinity of Block 297.
Cpl Lee noticed that the appellant looked troubled. He started to suspect that the appellant might have made a false report. Cpl Lee questioned the appellant who then confessed that he had made a false report to the police. He told Cpl Lee that he was heavily indebted to some friends. He had to pay them in two days` time, on 17 March, so he decided to make a false police report of robbery so that his friends would let him off the hook, at least for a while. On hearing this, Cpl Lee instructed his officers to call off their investigations. Cpl Lee then brought the appellant to Bedok Police Station.
At Bedok Police Station, Cpl Lee handed the appellant over to the duty investigating officer, one Corporal Jumali (Cpl Jumali). Cpl Lee made a police report that the appellant had given false information to a police officer. In the meantime, Cpl Jumali referred the appellant to one Staff Sergeant Goh Tat Boon (SSgt Goh), who recorded a statement from the appellant. In this statement, the appellant confessed that he had not been robbed. He had made a false report of robbery because he was unable to pay up on a loan of $3,800, due on 17 March, to a friend known as `Ah Lam`. With the police report, the appellant had hoped to persuade `Ah Lam` to give him more time to pay up on the loan.
Counsel for the appellant objected to the admissibility of this statement on the grounds that, first, the statement was actually recorded by Cpl Lee, not SSgt Goh, secondly, Cpl Lee had unlawfully induced the appellant to make the statement with the assurance that he would only get a warning from the police if he confessed to committing the offence of furnishing false information to the police, and, thirdly, some parts of the statement were actually supplied by Cpl Lee during the recording of the statement.
The trial judge decided that it was unnecessary to conduct a voir dire
 . 
 He allowed SSgt Goh to carry on with his evidence. After SSgt Goh had been cross-examined, the trial judge allowed counsel`s application for Cpl Lee to be recalled to the stand for further cross-examination on the issue of the identity of the recorder of the statement.
Since there was no voir dire, the appellant was not called to give evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the recording of the statement. The trial judge did not make any ruling as to who had recorded the statement, or if the statement had been voluntarily made. There was consequently no ruling on whether the statement was admitted in evidence. At the close of the prosecution`s case, the trial judge called for the defence.
 The defence 
The prosecution`s case rested entirely on the appellant`s confessions, first to Cpl Lee at Block 297 and later in the statement recorded by SSgt Goh. The defence`s strategy, therefore, was to attack the admissibility of these two confessions.
The appellant elected to give evidence. He maintained his story that he was robbed. He described the robbery in detail. He had told Cpl Chew at the police post that the robbers had taken from him $1,800 in cash. The figure of $2,800 recorded in the police post`s station diary was wrong. He had repeated his story of the robbery to Cpl Lee at Block 297. Cpl Lee had been very friendly with the appellant. They conversed in Hokkien. The appellant told Cpl Lee that he was a Malaysian national and was working in Singapore as a bus driver. The appellant told Cpl Lee that he was indebted to `Ah Lam`. At the time the appellant was robbed, he was carrying $1,500 which he had borrowed from a friend to pay the loan due to `Ah Lam`. The remaining $300 was his own money.
Without warning, Cpl Lee suddenly said that he suspected the appellant to have made a false report of robbery. The appellant denied this. Cpl Lee then proposed two `options` for the appellant. First, if the appellant admitted to making a false report, Cpl Lee would recommend to his superior officer to let the appellant off with only a warning. The second `option` was if the appellant insisted that he was robbed and if the investigation turned up nothing, thus suggesting that he had lied to the police, the appellant would receive severe punishment, including repatriation to Malaysia.
The appellant thought over the two `options` presented to him. He decided that he would admit to making a false report since otherwise, in his own words, `it was so troublesome`. He had been in Singapore since 1972. His wife and children were in Singapore. He would rather lose $1,800 than face the risk of being repatriated to Malaysia.
Cpl Lee then brought the appellant to the Bedok Police Station. After a short wait, the appellant was brought to a room with a computer. Cpl Lee asked the appellant a few questions about his personal particulars. He then typed a statement using the computer, printed it out and got the appellant to sign the statement. The appellant denied that his statement was recorded by SSgt Goh. In fact, the appellant denied having ever met SSgt Goh until the trial.
 The decision below 
The trial judge threw out the appellant`s oral confession to Cpl Lee at Block 297. He relied on s 25 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) which provides that: 
 
No confession made to a police officer who is below the rank of sergeant by a person accused of any offence shall be proved against such person.
 
 
 
The footnote to s 25 refers to s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the Code). Section 122 is the provision in the Code that governs the admissibility of statements made to police officers. It provides: 
 
(1) Except as provided in this section, no statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation made under this Chapter shall be used in evidence other than a statement that is a written statement admissible under section 141.
 
 
 
 
...
  
 
 
(5) Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person 
 to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant
 shall be admissible at his trial in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit ... [Emphasis is mine.]
 
 
 
Thus, like s 25 of the Evidence Act, s 122 of the Code only allows the admissibility of statements made to police officers of the rank of sergeant or above.
As for the appellant`s statement to SSgt Goh, the trial judge explained why he held that it was unnecessary to conduct a voir dire in order to determine the admissibility of the statement. This defence was that the statement had been recorded by Cpl Lee and not SSgt Goh, and that he was induced to sign the statement by Cpl Lee`s assurances that he would, at most, be given a warning by the police. On the other hand, the prosecution`s case was that it was SSgt Goh who had recorded the statement from the appellant and not Cpl Lee. The real and preliminary question to be determined was therefore one of fact - who had recorded the statement from the appellant?
The trial judge took the view that there was no issue of voluntariness to be tried on a voir dire. If the Court found that Cpl Lee was the recorder, the statement would have to be excluded on the basis that it was not recorded by a police officer of the rank of sergeant or above as mandated by s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code. A voir dire to test the admissibility of the statement on the ground of Cpl Lee`s alleged inducement would have been unnecessary in such a situation. If, however, it was found that it was SSgt Goh who recorded the statement, then the statement would be admitted in evidence without any need for a voir dire to determine the admissibility of the statement on the ground of possible involuntariness. This is because the appellant had made no allegations of any impropriety against SSgt Goh, but only against Cpl Lee.
At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge found as a fact that it was SSgt Goh who recorded the statement from the appellant. Cpl Lee was in charge of the robbery investigation and he had no duty to investigate into the appellant`s offence of making a false report. Cpl Jumali had testified that he was the officer in charge of the false report investigation and had referred the appellant to SSgt Goh for the statement to be recorded. SSgt Goh also testified that he had recorded the statement from the appellant. The trial judge disbelieved the appellant`s evidence of the alleged inducement by Cpl Lee and that he had given the statement to Cpl Lee instead of SSgt Goh. He took the view, from observing the appellant`s demeanour and the inconsistent answers he gave, that the appellant was simply not a credible witness.
Based on the confession of guilt in the statement made to SSgt Goh, the trial judge found that the charge against the appellant under s 182 of the Penal Code had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant and, after some consideration of the facts of the case and the conduct of the appellant at the trial, he sentenced the appellant to two months` imprisonment.
 The appeal 
The appellant raises several grounds of appeal. They mainly concern the correctness of the trial judge`s findings of fact as to the credibility of the witnesses and of the appellant himself. I express no views on the merits of these contentions because I find that there is a more fundamental error in the manner in which the trial proceeded below that warrants a serious consideration of whether the appellant`s conviction should be set aside and a retrial be ordered.
In my opinion, the trial judge made a serious error of law when he failed to hold a voir dire to resolve the issue of the identity of the recorder of the statement. The trial judge`s mistake was in thinking that a voir dire need only be conducted when the question of the voluntariness of a confession is raised. The true position is that the procedural safeguard of a voir dire is necessary whenever the admissibility of a confession is challenged, provided that the dispute over the admissibility is not confined to a pure point of law, but is one which requires the calling of evidence of the accused person and other witnesses in support of or against the admissibility of the confession. The question of the voluntariness of a confession is but one aspect of its admissibility. A confession may be inadmissible because it was obtained under oppression, a development of the common law, which strictly speaking does not fall under the general rubric of voluntariness. This is well-established in our local jurisprudence: see for example 
 PP v Lim Kian Tat 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 154
; 
[1990] SLR 364
 where a confession was excluded because it was obtained under oppression and 
 PP v Tan Boon Tat 
[1990] 2 MLJ 466
; 
[1990] SLR 375
 where the court found that the confession was admissible because the accused had failed to show any oppression. A confession may also be inadmissible because it was made to a police officer below the rank of sergeant, a statutory pre-condition of admissibility under s 122(5) of the Code: see for example the Malaysian case of 
 PP v Liik Ching Kwong 
[1988] 1 MLJ 398
 where a statement made to a police officer below the rank of inspector was held to be inadmissible under the equivalent Malaysian legislation. In most cases, the identity of the police officer who recorded the statement is not in issue, rather the contest is usually over the voluntariness of the statement. However, when there arises a dispute over the identity of the officer who recorded the a ccused person`s statement and this dispute affects the admissibility of the statement, as in this case, a voir dire to determine the question of admissibility is essential and cannot be dispensed with.
Counsel did not cite to me any authority directly covering the question of whether it is necessary for a trial judge to hold a voir dire to determine the admissibility of a statement when the only dispute is over the identity of the officer who recorded the statement. In my view, nevertheless, the position is clear. The necessity for a voir dire encompasses situations other than when the voluntariness of a confession is in dispute. As a general rule, it would cover all situations when the admissibility of a confession is challenged. In this case, since the question of the identity of the recorder of the statement was effectively a challenge to its admissibility, the trial judge should have held a voir dire to resolve the question of admissibility.
The deputy public prosecutor relies upon the Privy Council decision of 
 Seeraj Ajodha v State 
 
[1982] AC 204
. This was an appeal from the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago to the Privy Council. The question in 
 Seeraj Ajodha 
was whether a voir dire should have been held to determine the admissibility of a statement which contained a confession. The accused claimed that he was not the author of the statement and that his signature on the statement had been obtained by force. The Privy Council held that this raised the issue of the voluntariness of the statement itself and that that was an issue which had to be determined by the trial judge. Accordingly, the judge should have held a voir dire and, thereafter, ruled on the admissibility of the statement. His failure to do so meant that the trial was materially defective and the conviction should be quashed. What the deputy public prosecutor relies upon is a passage at p 222 of the report where Lord Bridge made the following remarks obiter when giving some examples of the types of situations that may be encountered in practice with respect to accused`s statements: 
 
On the face of the evidence tendered or proposed to be tendered by the prosecution, there is no material capable of suggesting that the statement was other than voluntary. The defence is an absolute denial of the prosecution evidence. For example, if the prosecution rely on oral statements, the defence case is simply that the interview never took place or that the incriminating answers were never given; in the case of a written statement, the defence case is that it is a forgery. In this situation no issue as to voluntariness can arise and hence no question of admissibility falls for the judge`s decision. The issue of fact whether or not the statement was made by the accused is purely for the jury.
 
 
 
This famous passage is often quoted in our courts by deputy public prosecutors and other prosecuting officers for the proposition that, when there is a dispute as to whether a confession was actually made, that is, when the accused alleges that the statement is a fabrication, there is no need to conduct a voir dire because there is no issue of voluntariness. The dispute is such cases is one of fact. The contested statement would be admitted in evidence and the question then is how much weight ought to be accorded to the statement at the conclusion of the trial. If the court finds that the statement is made by the accused person, then due weight should be accorded to the statement`s contents, depending, of course, on all the circumstances of the case. But if the court finds that the statement is not made by the accused person, then no weight at all is accorded to the statement. This proposition has been accepted in a number of High Court decisions; for one example see 
 PP v Tse Nathan 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 870
 which was cited to me by the Deputy Public Prosecutor. It has also been implicitly accepted by the Court of Appeal as representing the true state of the law in at least two decisions: 
 Seow Choon Meng v PP 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
 and 
 PP v Oh Laye Koh 
[1994] 2 SLR 385
.
The deputy public prosecutor seeks to persuade me that the appellant, by claiming that his statement was recorded by Cpl Lee rather than SSgt Goh, was in fact alleging that the written statement tendered to the court was not his statement at all but a complete fabrication. Hence, he argues, the dispute was whether the written statement tendered to the court was ever made by the appellant. As this dispute was one of pure fact and not of admissibility of the statement, the remarks of Lord Bridge in 
 Ajodha 
 were directly applicable and the trial judge was correct in deciding that there was no necessity to hold a voir dire.
I find this argument completely unacceptable. It is manifestly clear that the situation in this case is not one where the existence of the statement was disputed. The appellant did not dispute at the trial that the written statement was his statement or that it was his signature that appeared on the statement. His complaint was that he had given the statement to Cpl Lee and not SSgt Goh. He had signed the statement after Cpl Lee had recorded it from him. The appellant`s allegation was that Cpl Lee must have passed the statement to SSgt Goh who then appended his signature on the statement so as to make it appear that it was he who had recorded the statement from the appellant. By no stretch of logic can one say that the dispute here is actually over the existence of the statement. Clearly the dispute was over the identity of the recorder of the statement. The issue of the identity of the recorder would in turn determine the admissibility of the statement. Therefore, the remarks of Lord Bridge in 
 Seeraj Ajodha 
 are clearly inapplicable to our present situation.
In any event, the trial judge also erred in failing to realise that there was a subsidiary issue of the voluntariness of the statement. This was because, even if SSgt Goh was the recorder of the appellant`s statement, the appellant had raised the possibility that the statement might have been made as a result of the inducement by Cpl Lee at Block 297. There is no requirement, as the judge seemed to think, for the inducement to have proceeded from the person to whom the statement is given; the proviso to s 122(5) provides that a statement will be inadmissible if the making of the statement appears to have been caused by an inducement, threat or promise proceeding from a 
 person in authority 
. There is no doubt that Cpl Lee was such a person. Consequently, the trial judge should have conducted a voir dire to determine who had recorded the statement, and if it was SSgt Goh, to determine as well if the statement had been voluntarily made.
The deputy public prosecutor next argues that even if the trial judge should have held a voir dire to determine the admissibility of the statement, his failure to do so was merely an irregularity that can be cured under s 396 of the Code because there was no miscarriage of justice. Counsel pointed out that, at the conclusion of the trial, the judge properly assessed all the witnesses` evidence and decided that there was proof beyond reasonable doubt that the statement had been recorded by SSgt Goh. Furthermore, the trial judge also found that there was no inducement by Cpl Lee. Hence, if the trial judge had conducted a voir dire before the close of the prosecution`s case, he would have, in all probability, reached the same finding that it was SSgt Goh who had recorded the statement from the appellant and that the making of the statement had not been caused by any inducement. As such, there was no failure of justice caused by the failure to hold a voir dire.
I am unable to accept the deputy public prosecutor`s argument. Without a voir dire being held, the trial judge could not have determined the admissibility of the appellant`s statement. Nevertheless, it appears that the trial judge had effectively allowed the appellant`s statement to be admitted in evidence. This can be inferred from the fact that the trial judge called for the appellant to enter his defence at the close of the prosecution`s case when the statement was the only evidence upon which a prima facie case against the appellant could be made out. The only other piece of substantive evidence adduced by the prosecution, that is, the oral confession to Cpl Lee, was inadmissible because it was not made to a police officer of the rank of sergeant or above. The trial judge could not possibly have found, as he did at the close of the prosecution`s case, that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the appellant unless he had improperly admitted the statement in evidence.
Section 396 of the Code provides: 
 
Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of -
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
(c) ) the improper admission ... of any evidence,
  
 
 
unless the ... improper admission ... of evidence ... has occasioned a failure of justice.
 
 
 
Before the curative power under s 396 can be exercised, the court has to determine if the improper admission of evidence has occasioned a failure of justice. The approach of the court in answering this question is to ask if the improper admission of evidence would have resulted in a decision different from that which the court would have reached had the evidence not been admitted: 
 Wong Kok Keong v R 
 
[1955] MLJ 13
, see also 
 Mohamad Kassan bin Hassan v PP 
 
[1950] MLJ 295
 and 
 Shangara Singh v PP 
 
[1967] 1 MLJ 15
. In other words, the test to determine if the improper admission of evidence has occasioned a failure of justice is whether or not without that evidence, there was sufficient evidence to justify the conviction. I might add that such an approach is consonant with s 169 of the Evidence Act which provides that: 
 
The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case if it appears to the court before which such objection is raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, or that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision.
 
 
 
Applying this test to the facts of our case, if the statement which had been wrongly admitted by the trial judge is excluded from consideration, there is no other admissible evidence before the court to prove that the appellant had committed an offence under s 182 of the Penal Code. In fact, leaving aside the statement, at the close of the prosecution`s case, the prosecution had adduced no admissible evidence at all which could establish even a prima facie case against the appellant. The appellant`s statement was the only leg upon which the prosecution`s case could stand. At the close of the prosecution`s case, the appellant should not have been called to enter his defence. He should have been acquitted on the ground that there was no case to answer.
In 
 Aw Kew Lim v PP 
[1987] 2 MLJ 601
; 
[1987] SLR 410
, the accused persons were convicted of copyright offences. The prosecution had relied on a computer printout from the Registry of Companies to prove that the accused persons were the owners of a shop in which pirated cassette tapes were found. The trial judge admitted the computer printout as evidence. On appeal, Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) held that the computer printout was hearsay evidence and had been wrongly admitted. Chan Sek Keong JC quashed their convictions. The deputy public prosecutor relied on s 396 of the Code and argued that there was no failure of justice. In rejecting the deputy public prosecutor`s argument, first, Chan Sek Keong JC pointed out that, apart from the computer printout, there was no other evidence to prove that the accused persons were the owners of the shop from which the pirated cassette tapes were seized; his Honour then added (
[1987] 2 MLJ 601
 at p 603): 
 
In my view, s 396 had no application where the prosecution had not proved an essential ingredient of an offence. This was not a case where the improper admission of exh P20 had occasioned a failure of justice in the sense contemplated by s 396. This was a case where, if exh P20 had not been admitted, the prosecution had not crossed the threshold of proving a prima facie case for the accused to answer.
 
 
 
Similarly, in our case, if the appellant`s statement had not been admitted in evidence before the close of the prosecution`s case, there was no other evidence against the appellant; the prosecution thus could not have crossed the threshold of proving a prima facie case for the appellant to answer.
In the result, the appropriate order in this case is for the appeal to be allowed and the appellant be retried on the charge under s 182 of the Penal Code. The court has power to make such an order under s 256(b)(i) of the Code. When exercising its discretion whether to order a retrial, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case. The court must also have regard to two competing principles. One is that persons who are guilty of crimes should be brought to justice and should not be allowed to escape scot-free merely because of some technical blunder by the trial judge in the course of the trial. The countervailing principle is one of fairness to the accused person. The prosecution has the burden of proving the case against the accused person; if the prosecution has failed to do so once, it should not ordinarily get a second chance to make good the deficiencies of its case. These principles are summarised in 
 Chee Chiew Heong v PP 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 287
.
Considering the circumstances of this case, however, one can clearly see that ordering a retrial would not be tantamount to letting the prosecution have another bite at the cherry because it was really not any failing on the part of the prosecution that caused the trial judge to err in law. It is not that the prosecution had relied on unsatisfactory evidence to prove its case. The trial judge had come to his own conclusion, without any submission as to its necessity or otherwise, that it would be unnecessary to hold a voir dire to establish the identity of the recorder of the statement. At the same time, it is also clear, from the totality of the evidence adduced and the findings of the trial judge on the evidence, that the appellant`s conviction is being overturned even though his defence, which consisted mainly of a denial of the prosecution`s case, was not credible to any degree. Therefore, this would be a suitable case to order a retrial.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is the second stage in an application by the Public Prosecutor under the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 84A, 1993 Ed) to confiscate the benefits that the defendant derived from drug trafficking. The first step was for the issuance of a confiscation order, which was made on 4 May 1996.
The present application is for a certificate under section 7(2) of the Act. The provision reads 
 
If the court is satisfied as to any matter relevant for determining the amount that might be realised at the time the confiscation order is made (whether by an acceptance under section 6 or otherwise), the court may issue a certificate giving its opinion as to the matters concerned and shall do so if satisfied as mentioned in subsection (3).
 
 
 
A certificate under s 7 is not the final stage of confiscation proceedings. Ultimately, the plaintiff will have to apply for realisation orders under s 15 to get control of the property to be confiscated.
The plaintiff took the view that O 89B r 6 of the Rules of Court 1996 requires separate applications for the s 7 certificate and the realisation orders. Rule 6 says 
 
(1) An application by the Public Prosecutor under section 15 must be made by summons.
 
 
 
 
(2) ) The summons must be served with the affidavit in support thereof not less than 7 days before the date fixed for the hearing of the summons on - 
 
(a) the defendant; 
 
(b) any person holding any interest in the realisable property to which the application relates; and 
 
(c) the receiver, where one has been appointed in the matter.
  
 
 
(3) The application must be supported by an affidavit, which must to the best of the deponent`s ability give full particulars of the realisable property to which it relates and specify the person or persons holding such property, and a copy of the confiscation order, of any certificate issued by the Court under section 7(2) and of any charging order made in the matter must be exhibited to such affidavit.
 
 
 
Counsel submitted that to comply with sub-r (3) the certificate under s 7(2) must be obtained and exhibited with the application for a realisation order.
I do not think that this is really necessary. Sub-r (3) requires that `any certificate issued` under s 7(2) be exhibited. This means that if a certificate has already been issued, it must be exhibited, not that a certificate must be issued and exhibited. It does not prohibit an application for a realisation order before the issuance of a certificate eg when there is a need to realise a specific property before all the realisable property have been identified, nor does it forbid the application for the certificate and the realisation order at the same time.
To the contrary, efficiency and convenience commend that wherever possible the applications should be made, argued and disposed off together. There is no reason why the applications need to be proceeded with separately when interrelated matters and issues are to be considered. Splitting the applications results in the duplicity of time, effort and expenditure which can be avoided.
The Act provides for the confiscation order, certificate and realisation order because they have different functions. The purpose of the first is to quantify the benefits that a defendant has derived from trafficking. A certificate under s 7 states the amount that might be realized. The certificate will set the amount that the receiver appointed under s 15 of the Act is to recover, and the property against which the amount is to be realised. If the certified amount is greater than the amount of the confiscation order, the excess is not confiscated and will be returned. The realisation order empowers a receiver to be appointed to take control of the realisable property.
The defendant, his sisters Goh Joon Si and Goh Joon Fong, and his cohabitee Lau Bee Leng argued against the confiscation of some properties in their possession.
The defendant submitted that some of the items included in the plaintiffs` compilation of his assets were not derived from drug trafficking. I dealt with that when I determined the confiscation amount, but different criteria apply for determining whether a property should be part of the confiscation amount and for identifying the property from which the confiscated amount can be realised.
Section 8(1) provides that 
 
In this Act, `realisable property` means -
 
 
 
(a) any property held by the defendant; and
 
 
 
 
(b) ) any property held by a person to whom the defendant has, directly or indirectly, made a gift caught by this Act.
  
 
 
To be considered as part of the confiscation amount, a property must be derived from drug trafficking, eg shares purchased from a trafficker`s legitimate earnings will not be considered. However, under s 8(1)(a), any property he holds is realisable property to be taken into the quantification of the realisable amount, including those shares.
His sisters submitted that the $79,000 they received from him for the purchase of a flat should not be confiscated. By my earlier finding that $40,000 of that sum was from the defendant`s savings, only $39,000 of the $79,000 was taken into account in computing the confiscation amount. The thrust of their contention was that he had assisted them out of love and affection and that they came within s 9(2), which says that 
 
If a person applies to the court for an order under this subsection in respect of his interest in property and the court is satisfied -
 
 
 
(a) that he was not in any way involved in the defendant`s drug trafficking; and
(b) ) that he acquired the interest:: 
(i) for sufficient consideration; and 
(ii) without knowing, and in circumstances such as not to arouse a reasonable suspicion, that the property was, at the time he acquired it, property that was involved in drug trafficking,
 
 
 
the court shall make an order declaring the nature, extent and value (as at the time the order is made) of his interest.
 
 
 
The sisters should have filed an application under s 9. Although they did not do that, I will deal with the merits of their submission as the status of the $79,000 has to be considered before a certificate under s 7 is issued.
I accept that the sisters had no knowledge or reason to suspect that the payment was connected with drug trafficking activities. However, they did not come within sub-s (2)(b)(i). Their counsel submitted that `The consideration for ... this sum of $79,000 is ... love and affection between family members`, but love and affection is not consideration, let alone 
 sufficient 
consideration, which was not addressed. The payment was a gift to the sisters and a `gift caught by this Act` under s 8(8)(a) and (b) which read 
 
A gift (including a gift made before the commencement of this Act) is caught by this Act if -
 
 
 
(a) it was made by the defendant at any time since the beginning of the period of 6 years ending when the proceedings for a drug trafficking offence were instituted against him or, where no such proceedings have been instituted, when an application under section 4 for a confiscation order is made against him; or
(b) ) it was made by the defendant at any time and was a gift of property which is or is part of the benefits derived by the defendant from drug trafficking.
 
 
 
and realisable property under s 8(1)(b).
 
 
 
Lau Bee Leng contended in her affidavit that two rings and a gold chain recovered from her, and $77,000 quantified by the plaintiff to have been paid by the defendant to her should not be confiscated. The items of jewellery were gifts from the defendant and are realisable property under s 8(1)(b).
The defendant gave her a monthly allowance of $1,000 and $5,000 during the Chinese New Year to be distributed to relatives and friends. She said that the payments were rarely paid after the defendant`s business failed and he became a bankrupt, but this claim was undermined by the fact that the defendant was adjudicated a bankrupt in 1986, before the payments started. The plaintiff quantified the payments made to her at $77,000 but some uncertainty remained over the sum of these payments.
The plaintiff argued that this is a gift. If a gift is received confiscation is not restricted to the recovery of the gift itself. Under s 8(8)(a) a gift is caught by the Act if it was made within six years from the commencement of proceedings for a drug trafficking offence whether or not the gift was derived from the benefits of drug trafficking. Under sub-s (8)(b) a gift made at any time is caught by the Act if it is wholly or partly derived from the benefits of drug trafficking. Under s 8(1)(b), realisable property includes `any property held by a person to whom the defendant has, directly or indirectly, made a gift caught by this Act.` Thus when a person receives a gift watch from a trafficker, his house and all his property become realisable property, but this is ameliorated by s 17(3) which says 
 
In the case of realisable property held by a person to whom the defendant has, directly or indirectly, made a gift caught by this Act, the powers shall be exercised with a view to realising no more than the value for the time being of the gift.
 
 
 
Is the $77,000 a gift or realisable property? The defendant also paid `children`s allowance`, `family allowance` and `mother`s allowance`. These allowances were listed amongst the defendant`s expenditure that was a component in the computation of his concealed income, but not as part of his realisable property. A man may be under a legal obligation to provide maintenance for his wife and children under the Women`s Charter. Since the Maintenance of Parents Act came into force on 1 June 1996, he may also be obliged to maintain his parents. That does not mean that the payments which the defendant paid to his wife, children and mother which were not made under the statutes are recoverable from them. The plaintiff impliedly accepted this by not treating them as realisable property. Likewise, if a person make payments for the maintenance of an impoverished sibling, it would be harsh to regard the payments as gifts and recover the maintenance from the recipient just because the law does not require such payments to be made. If the payments are made out of a sense of duty and are reasonable, they should not be regarded or recovered as gifts.
Where do the payments to Lau Bee Leng stand? At the defendant`s request she stopped working as a lounge hostess to cohabit with him. They lived as man and wife and he introduced her to his friends as his wife. He supported her by giving her $1,000 a month for herself and $5,000 for distribution to relatives and friends over the Chinese New Year. The payments were not excessive or exceptional in the context of their relationship, and should be treated like the children`s allowance, family allowance and mother`s allowance, and should not be regarded as gifts.
The plaintiff had compiled a list of the items comprising the defendant`s known realisable assets, which added up to $194,047.03. The first group of items is property held by the defendant, and is realisable property whether the items were acquired from the benefits of drug trafficking or from other income, or were given to him as gifts. The second group is money in two bank accounts held by his wife and his sister as his nominees because of his bankruptcy. The money is his beneficially and is also realisable property. There are three items of jewellery which the defendant gave to Lau Bee Leng. These are gifts under s 8(1)(b) and are realisable property under s 8(8)(a). Lastly there is the $79,000 which the defendant gave to his sisters, which is also recoverable. Although I have found when determining the confiscation amount that $40,000 of the $79,000 was from his savings, in determining the realisable sum that gift is realisable property whether it was derived from the benefits of his drug trafficking activities or not.
The only sums that are not recoverable as realisable property are the $77,000 paid to Lau Bee Leng which is not to be a gift and thus not a realisable property. Consequently the $77,000 should be taken out of the plaintiff`s computation. The amount that might be realised is therefore $117,047.03, and I so certify.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellants were convicted on the following charge in themagistrate`s court:
 
You, Chuan Hoe Engineering Pte Ltd Ã‰
 
 
 
 
 
are charged that you, on or about 25 October 1995 inSingapore, diddevelop the premises at 37A Tyrwhitt Rd without the written permission of thecompetent authority in contravention of s 10(1) of the Planning Act (Cap 232),in that you fail to comply with the directions in the Enforcement Notice No250/95 issued under s 16(1) of the said Act, to:
 
 
 
 
 
icease the unauthorised use of the said premises as a store for machinery andequipment and
 
 
 
iiremove all paraphernalia pertaining to the said unauthorised use from thepremises,
  
 
 
 
 
after the said enforcement notice had been served on youon 11 May1995, which is an offence punishable under s 16(8) of the PlanningAct.
 
 
 
The undisputed facts were that in December 1951, approval wasgiven todevelop six shophouses on Tyrwhitt Road. One of the shophouses erected was 37ATyrwhitt Road (37A TR), which was the appellants` premises. AccordingtoChiang Kok Him, a senior technical officer from the Urban RedevelopmentAuthority (URA), the second storey of 37A TR was only approved for residentialpurposes. 37A TR was in a location zoned for Olocal shopping`under theMaster Plan. This Master Plan was consistent with the land use plan of thecolonial government before 1960. No other planning approval has since beengiven for 37A TR.
On 2 May 1995, Ho Kie Hock, a technician from the URA, inspected37A TRand found that the second storey was used to store machinery and equipment. Anenforcement notice, purportedly issued under s 16(1) of the Planning Act (Cap232, 1990 Ed) (the Act) was served on the appellants on 11 May 1995.
The notice states, inter alia:
 
The Competent Authority HEREBY GIVES YOU NOTICE that inthe opinion ofthe Competent Authority:
 
 
 
 
 
aDevelopment has been carried out on [37A TR] without the written permission ofthe Competent Authority required in respect thereof under Section 10(1) of thePlanning Act (Cap 232, 1990 Ed) to wit:
 
 
 
 
 
Use of the said premises as a store for storage ofmachinery
 
 
 
 
 
bThe said development was carried out on or about May 1995.
 
 
 
 
 
Ã‰
 
 
 
 
 
AND HEREBY DIRECTS, pursuant to Section 16(1) of thePlanning Act (Cap232, 1990 Ed), that within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of service ofthis Notice you shall:
 
 
 
 
 
iCease the unauthorised use of the said premises as a store.
 
 
 
iiRemove all paraphernalia pertaining to the unauthorised use from the saidpremises.
  
 
 
No prosecution witness was able to tell the court, and they quitecandidly admitted that they did not know, whether the second storey of 37A TRhad been used as a store before 1 February 1960. The significance of this datewas that this was when the Act came into effect as the PlanningOrdinance.
That was the sum total of the prosecution evidence. It is notnecessaryto delve into details of the defence evidence, save to say that it was claimedthat the second storey of 37A TR had been used as a store since before 1February 1960. In view of the fact that the prosecution was in no position tochallenge the testimony of the appellants` witness on this issue, thedefence claim was accepted by the magistrate.
I shall first deal with the charge. The magistrate indicated thatthecharge was Ounusual`. The prosecuting officer submitted that theonuswas on the prosecution to prove unauthorised development of the land. That waswhy the appellants were charged for developing the land. The magistrate heldthat, in view of the prosecuting officer`s explanation, it was clearthatthe prosecution was proceeding under s 16(8) and not s 10(8) of theAct.
The magistrate understated the problem with the charge. Thecharge wasnot merely Ounusual`, it was plainly bad. It was duplicitous. Asit was,the charge accused the appellants of developing the premises without writtenpermission, contrary to s 10(1) of the Act; and for failing to comply with thedirections in the enforcement notice, contrary to s 16(8) of the Act.
Section 168 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) states:
 
For every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shallbe a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately except inthe cases mentioned in sections 169, 170, 172 and 176.
 
 
 
A charge alleging that the accused committed two or more offencesisduplicitous and contravenes s 168. Reference need only be made to
 Ramachandran v PP 
[1972] 2 MLJ 183
; [1972D1974] SLR 383; 
 See YewPoo v PP 
 
[1949] MLJ 131
 (CA, Kuala Lumpur); and
 PP vNorzilan bin Yacoob 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 442
 (HC, Kuala Lumpur). As can beseen from these cases,the exceptions refer to joinder of charges and not duplicity.
However, the same cases decide that this form of duplicity isonly anirregularity which can be cured by s 396 of the CPC, provided that eachoffence could have been the subject of a separate charge and could be triedtogether, that the accused was not prejudiced, and no failure of justice wasoccasioned by the duplicity. A failure of justice is considered to haveoccurred where the duplicity caused confusion in the mind of the trial judgeso that he did not consider the evidence in respect of each alleged offenceseparately; see
 See Yew Poo v PP 
and 
 PP v Mohamed Fathi bin Haji Ahmad 
[1979] 2 MLJ 75
.
In the present case, I am of the view that the defect in thecharge canbe cured. Section 10(1) of the Act provides:
 
No person shall, without the written permission of thecompetentauthority, develop any land.
 
 
 
Section 12 defines what is meant by Odevelop`. Therelevant partof s 12(1) states:
 
In this Part, except where the context otherwise requires,Odevelop` means to carry out any building, engineering, mining orotheroperations in, on, over or under land, or the making of any material change inthe use of any building or land Ã‰
 
 
 
Section 12(2)(d) provides additionally:
 
the use for other purposes of a building or part of abuildingoriginally constructed as a dwelling house involves a material change in theuse of the building[.]
 
 
 
On the facts of this case, the prosecution was able to produce noevidence, and in fact simply had no basis to allege that there had been anymaterial change in the use of 37A TR (or the second storey of it, assumingthat falls under s 12(2)(d)), since 1 February 1960. The appellants obviouslycould not breach s 10(1) before 1 February 1960 as that provision only cameinto effect on that day. There was therefore no ground for alleging that theappellants contravened s 10(1) of the Act by Odeveloping` 37ATR.
In the circumstances, there could not have been any conviction ons10(1) of the Act. There was none in this case, because the magistrate took theview that the prosecution was not accusing the appellants of an offence underthis section. The s 10(1) charge within the charge as framed can therefore beignored.
This left only the second charge, that of failing to comply withtheenforcement notice. On this, there was evidently some confusion of the issues.At p 5 of his grounds the magistrate stated:
 
It was not disputed that the 1951 planning approval forthe shophouserestricts the use of the second floor for residential purposes. The storage ofmachinery and equipment is inconsistent with the use of the premises as adwelling house. Therefore, in my view, there was development of the land incontravention of section 10 of the Planning Act and the competent authorityhad rightly issued the enforcement notice.
 
 
 
This was a remarkable conclusion considering that the magistratehadjust found that the premises had been used as a store since before the Actcame into effect. I do not see how he could have arrived at this conclusionhad there not been confusion. To some extent, however, this was contributed toby defence counsel`s reliance on r 3(1) of the Planning (Use Classes)Rules1981 as a defence. That provision deals with when a change of use is not to beregarded as a development. It is irrelevant in this case, and the defence wasrightly rejected by the magistrate. Ironically, one of the grounds stated wasthat there was no change of use. Then again, defence counsel could similarlyhave been confused by the charge.
The same argument was canvassed bef ore me by learned counsel fortheappellants. I pointed out to him that it might be more helpful to his clientsfor him to concentrate on the fact that the second storey had been used as astore since before 1960. Learned counsel then adopted as his argument mysuggestion that the issue here was whether the change of use in this case,which was made before the Act came into effect, could be said to be Oincontravention of s 10` of the Act.
Quite fortunately, the only relevant issue of fact in this casewas thatthe second storey of 37A TR had been used as a store since before 1 February1960. Even if the charge had been correctly framed, that would still be theonly factual issue on which there could have been a dispute on the evidence.Given the state of the prosecution`s evidence, there could be only oneconclusion on this issue. That is that the defence`s claim must beaccepted. It was so accepted by the magistrate. I am therefore able to saythat the appellants had not been prejudiced by this confusion, nor had therebeen a failure of justice. Had the factual issues not been so simple, I wouldhave ruled that the duplicity in the charge cannot be cured.
So much for the evidence that the defence called, regardless ofthedefect in the charge. The confusion that followed related to the ingredientsof an offence under s 16 of the Act. That is purely a question of law, and caneasily be cured by an appellate court.
I therefore turn now to the ingredients of an offence under s16(8) ofthe Act. Section 16(1) states:
 
If, in the opinion of the competent authority, anydevelopment of landor any works within a conservation area has been carried out in contraventionof section 10 or 13 or any condition imposed thereunder, the competentauthority may, by notice in writing (referred to in this Act as an enforcementnotice), require such measures as are directed in the not ice to be takenwithin such time as is stated in the notice.
 
 
 
Section 16(8) states:
 
Any person who fails to comply with any direction in anenforcementnotice by the competent authority, under subsection (1), shall be guilty of anoffence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $3,000 and,in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $100 forevery day during which the offence continues after conviction.
 
 
 
The magistrate was of the view that the prosecution need notprovedevelopment, even though the prosecution conceded otherwise. In my view, theconcession by the prosecution was rightly made. The natural interpretation ofs 16(1) is that the opinion of the authority relates to whether thedevelopment of land was in contravention of s 10 or any conditions thereunder.It does not relate to whether there was or was not a development of land. Hadit been otherwise, the provision would have stated, OIf, in the opinionofthe competent authority, there had been development of land in contraventionof s 10,` or words to that effect. I have not referred to s 13 becausethatis not relevant in this case, but the same reasoning applies.
In 
 PP v Abdul Razak Valibhoy 
[1993] 3 SLR 902
, I held at p 906 that:
 
In summary, all the prosecution has to show to make out aprima faciecase under s 16(8) against the respondent is, first, that there was aninfringement of the Act; secondly, that the respondent was a person who fellwithin one of the three classes in s 16(2); thirdly, that they had sent anenforcement notice to the respondent; and fourthly, that the respondent hadfailed to comply with the notice within 28 days Ã‰
 
 
 
Had this case been brought to the attention of the learnedmagistrate,he would have held that he was bou nd by it.
Nevertheless, the ratio of that case in this respect might nothave beenclearly stated. I should explain what was meant there. In
 Preston v Donohoe 
(1906) 3 CLR 1089, the words Oin the opinion of` in a penalprovision was the subject of argument. Griffith CJ held in the High Court ofAustralia that:
 
The next objection was that the officer did not apply hismind to theproper question, and that his opinion, therefore, had no legal effect. Itappears, however, from the evidence that he directed his attention to thequestion whether Mahomet Mithoo fell within class (a) of sec 3. We think thatit was necessary to show that the officer had applied his mind to a relevantquestion: 
 The Queen v Vestry of St Pancras
 24QBD 371; but when he has done so, the opinion which he has formed has theeffect which is given to it by the Act, and cannot, in our judgment, bequestioned in a prosecution founded upon his opinion.
 
 
 
There is therefore no need for the prosecution to show that therehadbeen an infringement. However, it is necessary for the prosecution to showthat the relevant authority had directed its mind to the question of whetherthere was a contravention of s 10(1).
In any event, the prosecution must prove that there was aOdevelopment`. ODevelopment` in s 16(1) must referto developmentof land occurring on or after 1 February 1960. This is because any developmentof land before this date cannot be Oin contravention of s 10`. Inthepresent case, the prosecution must show that the change in use was
 made 
on or after 1 February 1960.
The learned deputy public prosecutor submitted that any materialchangein use constituted a Odevelopment`. The illegal use of the secondstoreyof 37A TR as a store when it was only granted planning approval for use as aresidence was an offence under s 127 of the Singapore Improvement Ordinance(Cap 259, 1955 Ed) which was then in force. Section 127 made a contraventionof s 61 of that Ordinance an offence.
I do not propose to reproduce those provisions of the Ordinance.I needonly say that s 61 dealt with the Oerection` of buildings whichwere notin conformity with the General Improvement Plan. Under s 63, erection includedthe conversion to other purposes of a house originally constructed as adwelling house.
I do not know whether a shophouse was a Odwellinghouse` for thepurposes of that Ordinance. I also do not know whether the use of part of ashophouse as a store in an area zoned as Olocal shopping` wouldbe toOconvert` a dwelling house to other purposes not in conformitywith theGeneral Improvement Plan. One would have thought that if a house is to be ashophouse, part of it would necessarily have been a store for theshop`sstock. It would also have been arguable whether a mere change of use, withoutdoing any building work, amounted to converting a house, especially when oneconsiders the ejusdem generis rule when reading s 63 of the Ordinance.
I add that it is quite clear from s 53 of that Ordinance that theMasterPlan was an altogether different creature from the General Improvement Plan.No General Improvement Plan was ever produced in evidence, though I seriouslydoubt whether it would have thrown any light on the matter. The GeneralImprovement Plan dealt with zoning and the laying out of lots and streets. Itdid not deal with parts of a specific building.
Perhaps the learned deputy public prosecutor could have mentioneds 144of the Municipal Ordinance (Cap 133, 1936 Ed) instead. That provision dealtwith erection of buildings in accordance with plans and specificationsa pproved by the Municipal Commissioners. There was a similar definition oferection to include the conversion to other purposes of a building originallyconstructed as a dwelling house. Since the change in use occurred sometimebetween 1951 and 1960, one may also refer to s 169 of the Local GovernmentOrdinance 1957. My comments about whether a mere change of use amounted toconverting the house applies equally to these Ordinances.
I mention these other ordinances only to show the difficulty withthelearned Deputy Public Prosecutor`s argument. It was unlikely that thelegislative intent was that just because there was some approval givensometime in the past for a building or part of a building to be used for somepurpose, and that it appears that the building or part of the building hadbeen used in contravention of what is now very dead legislation, the competentauthority is entitled to issue an enforcement notice under s 16 of the Act.The legislature could hardly have intended that the officers of the competentauthority address their minds to what is, by now, legal archeology, beforethey issue an enforcement notice.
I am fortified in my view by the very clear language of s 16. Thesection speaks of development in contravention of s 10 of the Act. It does notrefer to contravention of any earlier legislation, such as the SingaporeImprovement Ordinance, the Municipal Ordinance, the Local Government Ordinanceor any other Ordinance which may date back to who knows when. In my view, sucha remarkable proposition would require nothing but the clearest statutorylanguage. In this case, the statutory language is as clear as can be, but inthe opposite direction. I cannot accept the respondent`ssubmission.
I appreciate that there could be very good policy reasons whythereshould be provisions allowing for contraventions of early planning legislationto be rectified in the present day. On the other hand, it may well be thatthese early schemes ended in such chaos that there were equally cogent policyconsiderations in letting sleeping dogs lie. It must be remembered that thePlanning Ordinance was passed side by side with the Housing and DevelopmentOrdinance. The two complemented each other, and the latter could well havebeen the intended instrument of rectification.
The rather fiery legislative assembly debate during the secondreadingof the Planning Bill, which is reported in Singapore Legislative AssemblyDebates Official Report Vol 9 columns 1830D1845, threw no light on thisissue, nor did the Select Committee Report in Sessional Paper No LA 21 of1958. For a fuller picture, reference may also be made to the debate on theHousing and Development Bill, which immediately preceded this. Whatever themerits may be of either view, which may or may not have changed since 1958,that is a matter for Parliament to decide.
Returning to the facts of this case, once it is appreciated thattherewas no basis to allege that the appellant had made any change of use incontravention of s 10(1), it would have been patent that the competentauthority cannot properly have formed an opinion that any development of landhas been carried out in contravention of s 10. The prosecution`sevidencewas that the officers from the URA did not know whether the second storey of37A TR had been used as a store since before 1 February 1960. An opinioncannot be founded upon ignorance.
In the present case, the officers obviously did not apply theirminds tothe question whether there was development in contravention of s 10. They didnot know whether any change of use, much less material change of use, had beenmade since the Act came into effect and they made no effort to find out. Theenforcement notice, which was signed by Ho Kie Hock, stated that thedevelopment was carried out on or about May 1995. However, he had gone to thepremises to survey the place on 19 April 1995. He must have been aware that atleast since 19 April 1995, the place had been used as a store. Had he directedhis mind to whether there was development of the place within the meaning ofthe Act, he could not possibly have come to the conclusion that theOdevelopment was carried out on or about May 1995.`
In fact, it appears from the record that at every stage of theproceedings, the competent authority was under the misconception that so longas the premises are used for a purpose not falling within any planningapproval, there is a development of the land. This much was stated by theprosecuting officer. It is wrong. Development includes the
 making 
of a material change of use, not the mere use, of premises. I note alsothat the prosecution witnesses did not at any stage testify whether anyone,not necessarily the appellants, had made a change of use of the premises since1 February 1960.
For these reasons, the enforcement notice issued by the competentauthority was invalid and of no legal effect. In any event, it has not beenshown that there had been a development within the meaning of s 16 of the Act.Two essential ingredients for an offence under s 16(8) are missing. Theconviction cannot stand. I will allow the appeal.

ss 244, 266 & 268 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
The appellant, who was a hawker, operated an Indian food stall named Bilai Muslim Food at Bee Huat Eating House in Yishun. On 10 August 1995, enforcement officers from the Ministry of Labour arrested one Indian overstayer, Durasamy Devarajan, and one Sri Lankan overstayer, Mohamed Nazar Yusoof Kamal, at the appellant&`s food stall. They were both found to be working when they were arrested. In fact, the Sri Lankan national, Mohamed Nazar, was found to have overstayed in Singapore for no less than 94 days.
The appellant was thus charged under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (the Act) with the offence of employing a Sri Lankan national, Mohamed Nazar, who had overstayed on his visit pass in contravention of s 15(1) of the Act. The appellant pleaded guilty to this charge. As a result, a second charge of the same nature under s 57 of the Act was taken into consideration. In the second charge, the appellant was indicted for employing Durasamy Devarajan, an Indian national, as a general worker at the stall when he had overstayed his visit pass, in contravention of s 15(1) of the Act.
The facts of this case were largely found on the statement of facts, which was admitted by the appellant without qualification at the trial below. The appellant admitted that sometime on 18 May 1995, the licensee of the stall, one Ganapathy s/o Murugayan, informed the appellant that he would be leaving Singapore for India at the end of the month. He requested the appellant to take care of his stall business. The appellant was told to engage his own workers to operate the stall. He agreed and began operating the stall a month later.
When the appellant went to take over the business on 18 June 1995, he saw Mohamed Nazar making the roti prata at the stall. The appellant informed him that he would be taking over the stall business and he would continue to employ him to make the roti prata for a daily wage of $50.00. On 21 June 1995, Mohamed Nazar told the appellant that he was an overstayer. However, the appellant continued to employ him until he was arrested on 10 August 1995. In fact, the appellant had last paid his wages on 9 August 1995, the day before he was arrested.
The appellant pleaded guilty to the first charge on 29 February 1996, and the second charge was taken into consideration. The case was adjourned to 25 March 1996 for sentencing and bail was extended. On that day, counsel for the appellant, Mr Subir Singh, applied for a discharge and informed the court that Mr SK Kumar would be taking over the case.
Mr Kumar then informed the court that the appellant wished to retract his plea of guilty made on 29 February 1996, for the following reasons. First, the appellant was not the employer but was, in fact, an employee himself, the employer being the said Ganapathy s/o Murugayan, the licensee of the stall. Second, the appellant had pleaded guilty because he was not confident that the documents he needed for his defence would arrive in time for the trial.
The trial judge rejected the appellant&`s application to retract his plea of guilty, and he was sentenced to seven months&` imprisonment. The appellant, being dissatisfied with the decision, appealed against the refusal of the court to retract his plea of guilty.
 The appeal 
At the outset, it should be noted that although counsel for the appellant was challenging the trial judge&`s decision in refusing to allow the appellant to retract his plea of guilty, he was in effect appealing against the correctness of his conviction. This was despite his having pleaded guilty to the charge. Section 244 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) clearly states that :
 
When an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted by a District Court or Magistrate&`s Court on that plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence.
 
 
 
Although an examination of the Malaysian cases would suggest that the normal procedure of appealing against conviction was used, where the appeal was against the trial judge&`s refusal to allow a plea of guilty to be retracted, I am of the opinion that the appellant was precluded from appealing against his conviction by virtue of s 244 of the CPC. The correct procedure should have been to apply for a revision. As I have explained above, this was because the appellant was in effect appealing against the correctness of his conviction ~ 
 Mok Swee Kok v PP 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
, 
 Chen Hock Heng Textile Printing v PP 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 745
.
The court can exercise its discretion and deal with the matter on revision, pursuant to s 266 and 268 of the CPC. On the present facts, however, I was of the view that this was not a case which warranted a review of the conviction, for the following reasons.
In 
 Mok Swee Kok v PP, 
I emphasised that where the court was capable of reviewing the conviction in exercise of its powers of revision, the very scope of these powers obliged the court to act with great circumspection and only where it was manifestly plain that the offence charged was nowhere disclosed in the statement of facts tendered. In the present situation, the statement of facts was admitted by the appellant without qualification and all the essential elements which constituted the offence was found in the statement.
Moreover, I was of the view that the trial judge had exercised his discretion properly in refusing to allow the appellant to retract his plea of guilty. The principles relating to retraction of a plea of guilty were laid down in 
 PP v Sam Kim Kai 
 
[1960] MLJ 265
 where Rigby J said at p 267:
 
Now, there is, no doubt, a discretion vested in a trial Court to allow an accused person, before sentence, to withdraw a plea of guilty and to substitute a plea of not guilty. But that discretion requires to be exercised judicially and for valid reasons. An accused person cannot be permitted merely at whim to change his plea, except upon valid and sufficient grounds which satisfy the Magistrate that it is proper and in the interests of justice that he should be allowed to do so.
 
 
 
In 
 R v McNally 
 
[1954] 1 WLR 933
, Lord Goddard CJ indicated that the discretion to allow an accused to retract his plea of guilty should be exercised in his favour where there was a question of mistake or misunderstanding, or that it would be desirable on any ground that the accused should be allowed to join issue. However, it is undesirable to attempt to lay down any hard and fast rule as to how the discretion should be exercised ~ 
 Abdul Mormin v PP 
 
[1939] MLJ 323
.
Moreover, the discretion exists so long as the court is not functus officio. Since the court is not usually functus officio until sentence is passed, a withdrawal of the plea of guilt, even though unequivocal, can be entertained at the stage of mitigation or at any time before the case is finally disposed of by sentence ~ 
 Abdul Mormin v PP 
 
[1939] MLJ 323
; 
 Lee Weng Tuck v PP 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 143
.
In 
 Lee Weng Tuck v PP 
 , the Supreme Court of Kuala Lumpur ruled that a plea of guilty must be valid and unequivocal, and in order to determine the validity of a plea of guilty, the following safeguards should be observed. First, the court must ensure that it is the accused himself who wishes to plead guilty. Thus in 
 R v Tan Thian Chai 
 [1932] MLJ 74, Whitley J held that an accused person should plead guilty or claim to be tried by his own mouth and not through his counsel.
Second, the court must ascertain whether the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea. Third, the court must establish that the accused intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him. The court also held that it was insufficient that the plea of guilty under the first safeguard was unequivocal if the other safeguards were not complied with. It can been seen that the second and third safeguards are embodied in s 139 of the CPC read together with s 187 for cases triable in the High Court, and in s 180(a)(b) for summary trials by the magistrate&`s court or the district court.
In the present case, there was no doubt that the appellant himself had wished to plead guilty. Moreover, the notes of evidence showed clearly that the appellant understood the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea. There was nothing to suggest that he had failed to appreciate the material facts of the case. In addition, the appellant had the benefit of counsel since the first mention of the case, and at no time was it suggested that he had been wrongly advised.
In 
 Lee Weng Tuck v PP 
 , the court further explained that, with regard to the third safeguard, it was an established practice that, on a plea of guilty, the prosecution would supply to the court the statement of facts constituting the offence with which the accused was charged. The statement would then be read out and explained to the accused. Unless the accused admitted the facts without qualification, the practice would be to treat the plea as a plea of not guilty.
At this point, it should be noted that, as far as the statement of facts is concerned, there is no statutory provision which imposes a requirement that the court should consider the statement of facts, which is usually tendered to it by the prosecution when the accused pleads guilty, for the purpose of ensuring that the facts recounted therein establish every element of the charge. Nowhere in s 180(b), or indeed within the rest of the CPC, is there a provision directing the court to consider the statement of facts before it accepts the accused&`s plea of guilty. When an accused pleads guilty, what he pleads is to the charge.
The original purpose of the statement of facts was to provide judges with some form of assistance in assessing the penalty to be meted out and to enable the appellate court to assess the appropriateness of the sentence in the event that it was called into question. However, in recent years the courts have held that the practice of recording the statement of facts has evolved into a legal duty and the court must scrutinise the statement of facts for the explicit purpose of ensuring that all the elements of the charge are made out therein ~ 
 Chota bin Abdul Razak v PP 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 77
; 
[1991] SLR 675
 and 
 Mok Swee Kok v PP 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
. Thus, I should emphasize that the third safeguard propounded in 
 Lee Weng Tuck v PP 
 is an important safeguard where the appellant pleads guilty to a charge, for otherwise, there may be no way in which the court can decide whether the elements of the offence have been established, and thus no justification for convicting the appellant.
Reverting back to the present case, it was clear that the appellant had intended to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him. The statement of facts was interpreted and explained to him. The mandatory sentence of imprisonment was also explained. The trial judge had satisfied himself that the appellant understood the charge, the statement of facts and indeed, the whole proceedings. The trial judge also scrutinised the statement of facts and had satisfied himself that all the elements of the offence were found in it and had been made out.
Turning then to whether there was any ground on which the appellant should be allowed to retract his plea of guilty, there was certainly no question of a mistake or misunderstanding, the appellant having had the benefit of advice of counsel throughout the proceedings. Mr Kumar submitted that the reason why the appellant pleaded guilty to the charge was because he was not confident of getting the relevant documents in time. If this was the case, then it was open to Mr Subir Singh to apply for an adjournment of the matter. This, however, was not done. The trial judge noted that it was unlikely for Mr Subir Singh not to have asked for an adjournment, if such instructions were given.
Moreover, in none of the pre-trial conferences was there a reference to such documents. The first mention was on 22 September 1995, in which Mr Subir Singh had already been engaged as counsel. The case went through four pre-trial conferences. On 8 February 1996, approximately four and a half months after the appellant was first charged, the parties came to a common understanding that the prosecution would proceed on the first charge and the second one would be taken into consideration for sentencing. The appellant pleaded guilty on 29 February 1996 and Mr Subir Singh applied for mitigation and sentencing to be adjourned for another month, as the appellant had other commitments. The trial judge granted his application and adjourned the case to 25 March 1996.
As can be seen, during the many months between the first mention until he was convicted, there was no indication that the appellant wished to retract his plea of guilty nor did the appellant explain that he pleaded guilty because he was afraid that he could not get the relevant documents on time. It was only when the day of sentencing arrived that the appellant indicated that he wanted to change his counsel and retract his plea. From the circumstances, I wholly agreed with the trial judge that the appellant was being dilatory, and had not offered a valid reason for applying to retract his plea. As such, I was satisfied that the trial judge had applied his mind to the relevant criteria in determining whether to exercise his discretion to retract the plea, and that he had exercised this discretion correctly. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal.

This is an appeal from the decision of the High Court allowing the counterclaim of the respondents for damages for wrongful delivery by the appellants to an Indonesian company of several items of machinery belonging to the respondents. The material facts that gave rise to this appeal are as follows.
 The facts 
The appellants are a member of a group of companies involved in transportation and exhibition logistics and were the official forwarders of exhibits and materials for an exhibition, Woodworking and Forestry Indonesia `88, in Jakarta in 1988. The respondents were one of the participants in that exhibition and had to transport their exhibits, which were woodworking machines, from Singapore to Jakarta. Arrangements were made between the appellants and the respondents for the shipment of the exhibits which was duly carried out by the appellants in September 1988. Two shipments in all were made by the appellants.
In Jakarta, the appellants assisted the respondents, who were then represented by one Swee Geok Khoon (Swee), to set up the exhibits. Upon the setting up of the exhibits but before the start of the exhibition, Swee returned to Singapore. Arrangements were then made between the respondents and the appellants for the transfer of the exhibits, through the latter`s Indonesian counterparts, to a bonded warehouse after the close of the exhibition. Accordingly, after the exhibition the exhibits were transferred to the bonded warehouse. Subsequently, the appellants` Indonesian counterparts delivered some of the exhibits to an Indonesian company, PT Sudagu Dianta (Sudagu Dianta), who were the distributors of the respondents` products in Indonesia. In total, six machines were delivered to Sudagu Dianta, and they consisted of the following:
 
 
(1) A Wadkin Robinson Moulder, model GA220/2S+1; 
 
(2) A Wadkin Robinson Moulder, model GB-220M; 
 
(3) A Wadkin Robinson Moulder, model XJ-220; 
 
(4) A Wadkin Robinson Grinder, model NXU-230S; 
 
(5) A Wadkin Robinson Cross-Cut Saw, model BRA-350/4; and 
 
(6) A CKD Dust Extractor.
  
 
 
This delivery was made pursuant to a request by Sudagu Dianta. The appellants did not verify with the respondents the legitimacy of the request. The respondents subsequently informed the appellants that no delivery of any machine was to be made without instructions from the former, but this direction came too late, as delivery had by then been made. A dispute then arose between the parties. Subsequently, negotiations took place between Sudagu Dianta and the respondents and a settlement was reached, under which Sudagu Dianta paid to the respondents a sum of $206,800 in final settlement. However, the dispute between the appellants and the respondents remained unresolved, and the respondents refused to pay the appellants the charges for the services rendered by the latter.
In 1990, the appellants took out a writ in the district court claiming a sum of $29,447.20 being the charges for the transport of the exhibits to Jakarta, as well as for moving them to the bonded warehouse and the return of some other exhibits to Singapore. The respondents denied the claim and counterclaimed the value of the machines that had been misdelivered to Sudagu Dianta. The matter was eventually heard in the High Court.
 The appellants` case 
In support of their claim for the services rendered, the appellants contended that the transactions between the parties were contained in separate contracts: two to move two sets of exhibits to Jakarta, one to move the exhibits to the bonded warehouse, and finally one to move a small number of the exhibits back to Singapore. The total amount due under these contracts came to $29,447 and the appellants claimed that they were entitled to this amount for the services rendered, notwithstanding the allegation of misdelivery of the exhibits.
As regards the counterclaim, several defences were raised by the appellants. First, they contended that the delivery to Sudagu Dianta were authorized by one Jay J Fonteijn (Fonteijn) acting for the respondents. Fonteijn was present at the exhibition and was seeking employment from the respondents, and at some stage he was employed by the respondents. They alleged that Swee told the appellants` representative, one Danny Khor Beng Leong (Khor), that Fonteijn would be giving instructions on the disposal of the exhibits. The appellants were also informed by Swee that Sudagu Dianta were the respondents` agents, and that was understood by the appellants to mean that Sudagu Dianta had the authority to deal with the exhibits. Following the close of the exhibition, Fonteijn gave written instructions directing such delivery and Sudagu Dianta on their part also requested delivery of the items to them. The delivery was thus made with the respondents` authority. Next, in the event that the delivery was not authorized, the appellants relied on the exemption clauses contained in the Standard Trading Conditions of the Singapore Freight Forwarders Association 1986 (SFFA terms), to which the contracts made between the appellants and the respondents were subject. These terms, firstly, exempted the appellants from liability for any loss caused by complying with instructions given by their clients` agents; secondly, limited the amount of their liability; and finally discharged them from any liability unless the suit was brought within nine months after the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim. The respondents in this case did not institute the action until after the lapse of nine months. The appellants claimed that the respondents knew or ought to have known that the SFFA terms applied; alternatively it was contended that the terms were incorporated in the contracts through a course of dealing. Thirdly, the appellants relied on the arrangement made between Sudagu Dianta and the respondents an d contended that the respondents had received the full value of the machines and could not thereafter claim the same from the appellants. Finally, the appellants also challenged the values of the machines as claimed by the respondents.
 The respondents` case 
In response to the claim, the respondents contended that the arrangements between them and the appellants were embodied in one single contract, part performance of which would not entitle the appellants to recover the charges for the services they had performed. As there had been a misdelivery, the appellants were not entitled to anything at all.
In relation to the counterclaim, the respondents contended that the delivery was without their authority. Fonteijn had no authority, and Swee did not make any representation to Khor, as alleged, as he had left for Singapore at the material time. As for Sudagu Dianta, they were merely the distributors of the respondents` goods in Indonesia and were not truly agents of the respondents. The respondents disputed that the SFFA terms were incorporated in the contracts between them. Even if the SFFA terms were so incorporated, the respondents claimed that the clauses were unreasonable under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 of the United Kingdom, which applied by virtue of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43). The respondents denied that the appellants were released by the arrangement the respondents had made with Sudagu Dianta, and maintained that they were entitled to the true value of the exhibits, less what had been paid by Sudagu Dianta.
 The decision 
The learned judge found that there were separate contracts between the parties and held that the appellants were entitled to payment of the charges for the services rendered.
Turning next to the counterclaim, the learned judge found that the delivery of the six machines to Sudagu Dianta was not authorized. Fonteijn, who died before trial, was not in the respondents` employment at the material time, and had no authority to direct the release of the machines to Sudagu Dianta. Although Sudagu Dianta were distributors of the respondents` goods in Indonesia, they were not agents of the respondents for the purpose of taking delivery of the machines. The SFFA terms were not incorporated in and were not part of the contract in question. Further, the relevant terms were not pleaded or proved to be reasonable as required by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 of the United Kingdom. Finally, the learned judge held that the settlement reached between the respondents and Sudagu Dianta could not be relied upon by the appellants as that was only between the respondents and Sudagu Dianta and it was not shown that the respondents had received the full value of the machines from Sudagu Dianta.
The learned judge awarded to the respondents substantially the amount of the counterclaim, less the amount paid by Sudagu Dianta. Interest was also ordered from the date of delivery of the machines to Sudagu Dianta, which was taken as the approximate date of the loss.
 The appeal 
Substantially the same issues have been raised before us as were raised below. They are as follows:
 
 
(i) whether the delivery of the six machines to Sudagu Dianta was authorized by the respondents at the material time; 
 
(ii) whether the SFFA terms were incorporated in and were part of the contracts between the appellants and the respondents; 
 
(iii) whether the payment of $206,800 by Sudagu Dianta to the respondents was a satisfaction of the respondents` claim; 
 
(iv) whether by virtue of the settlement with Sudagu Dianta the respondents had ratified the wrongful delivery of the machines and waived the tort committed by the appellants; and 
 
(v) the quantum of the award.
  
 
 
Before us there was no dispute that though some of the transactions and events took place in Jakarta, no issues of conflict of laws were involved, nor was any evidence of foreign law adduced; so all matters will be considered with Singapore law as the governing law.
 Fonteijn`s authority 
The first issue turns on two questions of fact: (i) whether Fonteijn had the authority to instruct delivery of the machines to Sudagu Dianta, and (ii) whether Sudagu Dianta had the apparent or ostensible authority to act on behalf of the respondents to direct delivery of those machines to themselves. The basis of the appellants` claim that Fonteijn had the authority to give instructions for the disposal of the machines was the evidence of Khor that Swee had instructed him to follow Fonteijn`s instructions during the dismantling of the exhibition, and Fonteijn had apparently authorized the appellants to deliver the machines to Sudagu Dianta. The appellants also relied on the fact that Fonteijn was present at the exhibition and was not a stranger to the respondents. He was there seeking employment from the latter and had discussions with them. They contended that Fonteijn`s activities and his presence alongside the respondents` representatives indicated that Fonteijn was a representative as well, and was authorized to give the instruction that was given. The learned judge found that Swee did not give such instructions as alleged and could not have done so as he was not in Jakarta at that time. The learned judge also found that the evidence of the respondents` witnesses showed that Fonteijn was not in their employment, and that there were other persons present who instead of Fonteijn could have given the necessary directions rendering it unlikely that the respondents would have conferred such authority on Fonteijn. In our opinion, the learned judge was undoubtedly correct in these findings. The onus lay on the appellants to establish that Fonteijn had the authority and this they had failed to do.
 Sudagu Dianta 
We next turn to the apparent or ostensible authority of Sudagu Dianta to act on behalf of the respondents. On this, the appellants relied, first, on the fact that Sudagu Dianta were agents and distributors of the respondents` goods in Indonesia. They relied, secondly, on the evidence of Khor that Swee had told him that Sudagu Dianta were the respondents` agents and by the term `agents` Khor understood it to mean that Sudagu Dianta would be responsible for the machines at the end of the exhibition and therefore Sudagu Dianta could on the respondents` behalf instruct the appellants on what to do with the machines. However, to the contrary was Swee`s evidence that he did not meet Khor, that the alleged conversation did not take place and that Sudagu Dianta were not the respondents` agents having the authority to deal with those exhibits. The learned judge rejected Khor`s evidence and accepted Swee`s evidence. On the evidence before him the learned judge was entitled to do so. As for the position of Sudagu Dianta as agents and distributors of the respondents` goods in Indonesia, the learned judge held thus: 
 
The defendants, however, accepted that Sudagu Dianta were their defendants` agents in Indonesia but said they were agents in the sense that they were distributors. ...
 
 
 
In this case the word `agent` was used in a popular and not a legal sense. It clearly meant that Sudagu Dianta were Indonesian distributors for the defendants with no authority to take possession of the defendants` exhibits and appropriate them without prior arrangement. There was no prior arrangement for them to take delivery of the machinery. Accordingly, the plaintiffs failed to prove that Sudagu Dianta were the agents of the defendants in the legal sense of the word or that they had the authorization to take possession of the exhibits.
We are in entire agreement with him. Sudagu Dianta were the respondents` distributors or selling agents in Indonesia and nothing more, and this fact alone does not give rise to any representation that Sudagu Dianta had the apparent or ostensible authority to act on behalf of the respondents and order the delivery of the exhibits to themselves.
 The SFFA terms 
The relevant agreement governing the transaction in question was the third agreement, ie the agreement under which the appellants removed the exhibits and stored them in the bonded warehouse. The question is whether that agreement incorporated the SFFA terms. The agreement was made orally between the parties and there was no evidence that in relation to the instruction to place the goods into the bonded warehouse the respondents` representatives had in fact agreed to the incorporation of the SFFA terms. The appellants claimed to have sent a shipping manual containing the relevant clauses to the respondents, but the latter denied that they had received it. No express finding of fact was made on this, and the only conclusion that can be drawn is that the learned judge found that the appellants failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the documents were so received. There is no reason why we should interfere with this finding. The appellants relied on the invoice for the services rendered which was sent to the respondents and which contained a note at the bottom stating that the agreement was subject to the SFFA terms. However, that by itself was not effectual in incorporating the SFFA terms, as the invoice was received well after the contract was made: 
 Olley v Marlborough Court Ltd 
[1949] 1 KB 532
.
As there was no express incorporation of the SFFA terms in the third agreement itself, the question then is whether such incorporation could be implied from a course of dealing between the parties. The appellants relied mainly on the following documents: their faxes of 15 and 28 September 1988 in which they communicated to the respondents their rates of charges and the scope of their work in handling and transporting the exhibits to Jakarta. The fax of 15 September contained, inter alia, the following term which, however, was in somewhat smaller print compared to the substantive part of the fax: 
 
All business is transacted only in accordance with the Singapore Freight Forwarders Association Standard Trading Conditions (1986). Copy available upon application.
 
 
 
The fax of 28 September set out the following paragraph at the bottom: 
 
Terms and conditions: all business is undertaken only in accordance with the standard trading conditions of PT Trans-link Global Mandiri (copy upon application) and Trans-link Exhibition Forwarding Pte Ltd, ie the Singapore Freight Forwarders Association (1986). Copies upon application.
 
 
 
Following these faxes, the first and second contracts were made under which the appellants transported the exhibits to Jakarta. The appellants also relied on two invoices both dated 2 October 1988 which were made out by the appellants for services rendered under the first and second contracts. These were sent to the respondents prior to the third contract. Each of these invoices contained the following term: 
 
All business is transacted only in accordance with the Singapore Freight Forwarders Association Standard Trading Conditions (1986). Copy is available upon application.
 
 
 
But this again was in very smaller print at the foot of the invoice.
On the basis of the faxes of 15 and 28 September 1988, the SFFA terms might well have been incorporated in and have become part of the first and second contracts. Assuming that they had been so incorporated in the first and second contracts, the question is whether the SFFA terms were also incorporated in the third contract, which was a slightly different contract, ie a contract to remove and store the exhibits in a bonded warehouse. That contract was made orally and there was no document which showed that the appellants entered into that contract on terms that the SFFA terms would be part of the contract also. The appellants submitted that there was a course of dealing between them and the respondents on terms that the SFFA terms would be incorporated in the third contract. The main difficulty in the way of this argument was that there was no evidence of a course of dealing between the two parties. On the evidence, prior to the third contract, there were only the first and second contracts made between them and both related to the transport of the exhibits to the place of exhibition; in effect they were parts of one transaction. There was, therefore, really no evidence of sufficient course of dealing between them on the basis of which it can justifiably be said that the respondents had had sufficient notice of the SFFA terms and by implication these terms had been incorporated in the third contract.
The appellants relied on 
 Eastman Chemical International AG v NMT Trading Ltd & Anor 
[1972] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 25, and 
 Circle Freight International Ltd v Medeast Gulf Exports Ltd 
[1988] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 427. In the first case, the defendants as haulage contractors and carriers undertook to carry for the plaintiffs a quantity of synthetic resin by road from London to Wellesbourne in Warwickshire. In the course of the journey the lorry which carried the resin, caught fire and the entire quantity of resin was destroyed. To an action by the plaintiffs claiming damages for negligence the defendants pleaded, inter alia, that the contract was subject to the conditions of the Road Haulage Association Ltd and one of the conditions exempted them from liability. One of the issues before the court was whether these conditions which were not expressly agreed to by the plaintiffs were made part of the terms of the contract through a previous course of dealing. Prior to the contract in question, the parties had been dealing with each other for a period of about a year and for every contract made between them the defendants had sent an invoice on which was set out a specific reference to the application of these conditions. It was held that through this course of dealing those conditions had been incorporated in the contract as part of the terms.
In the second case, the defendants were exporters of various goods to the Middle East and the plaintiffs were the freight forwarding agents. The defendants exported dresses on a number of occasions using the plaintiffs` services. On one occasion, the dresses collected from the defendants for export were lost through the negligence of the plaintiffs` servant. To a claim by the defendants for damages for negligence the plaintiffs pleaded that the plaintiffs` liability was excluded by the Standard Trading Conditions of the Institute of Freight Forwarders Ltd (1981 Ed). One of the issues was whether those conditions were incorporated in the relevant contract made between the plaintiffs and the defendants. Prior to the contract there were at least 11 occasions where invoices were sent to the defendants containing a notice that the business was conducted on those trading terms. It was held by the Court of Appeal that through the course of dealing those terms had become part of the contract. Taylor LJ, who delivered the main judgment of the court, said, at p 433: 
 
Again, it is not necessary that notice of the conditions should be contained in a contractual document where there has been a course of dealing.
 
 
 
Here, the parties were commercial companies. There had been a course of dealing in which at least 11 invoices had been sent giving notice that business was conducted on the IFF terms at a place on the document where it was plain to be seen. Mr Zacaria knew that some terms applied. He knew that forwarding agents might impose terms which would frequently be standard terms and would sometimes or frequently deal with risk. He never sought to ask for or about the terms of business. The IFF conditions are not particularly onerous or unusual and, indeed, are in common use. In these circumstances, despite Mr Gompertz`s clear and succinct argument to the contrary, I consider that reasonable notice of the terms was given by the plaintiffs. Putting it another way, I consider that the defendants` conduct in continuing the course of business after at least 11 notices of the terms and omitting to request a sight of them would have led and did lead the plaintiffs reasonably to believe the defendants accepted their terms.
Plainly, the facts in these cases were far removed from those at hand. There was in this case no such course of dealing between the appellants and the respondents. The appellants have not shown that by the course of business and conduct of the parties the SFFA terms had been incorporated in the third contract.
 Satisfaction 
On this issue, the appellants contended that the respondents had received full satisfaction of their claim from Sudagu Dianta and in consequence have no claim against the appellants. It was not in dispute that the respondents had received from Sudagu Dianta a sum of $206,800 in satisfaction of their claim against the latter and in consideration of such payment one Frankie Chew Hai Peng, a director of the respondents, had affirmed a statutory declaration in the following terms: 
 
I Frankie Chew Hai Peng I/C No: 0156454/D of No 4 Tudor Close, Singapore 1129 being a director of Wadkin Robinson Asia Pte Ltd (herein called the company) hereby declare that the company has received the amount of S$206,800 credited to the company`s current account at the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp on 27 December 1989 from PT Sudagu Dianta.
 
 
 
The company agrees and affirms that final settlement from PT Sudagu has been received and that no further claims will be submitted.
In addition, there were also the auditor`s report and accounts of the respondents for the years ended 31 December 1988 and 31 December 1989 respectively. In the accounts for the year 1988 there was a note that a sum of $237,000 represented `a claim against a handling agent for loss of goods`, and this was treated in the accounts as part of the amount owing from trade debtors and as part of the current assets of the respondents. The auditors` report attached to the accounts also stated that the respondents were taking action and claiming this amount. But in the auditor`s report and accounts for the subsequent year, which were prepared after the respondents had received payment of the sum of $206,800 from Sudagu Dianta, no mention whatsoever was made in respect of such claim.
Relying on all these facts, the appellants contended that the only inference is that the respondents had been paid in full by Sudagu Dianta for the loss of the machines. We are unable to accept this argument. First, the settlement reached between the respondents and Sudagu Dianta was wholly a matter between the two of them, and it was open to the respondents to accept from Sudagu Dianta a sum of money which was less than the actual value, leaving the balance to be claimed from the appellants. Secondly, the appellants have placed too much emphasis on the annual accounts of the respondents. What the respondents had done was to reflect in their accounts a claim which they had against their handling agents in respect of the loss of their goods. At that time they valued their claim in the sum of $237,000. It is not unusual for a company to treat a claim conservatively and understate the amount it can recover. This may well be the position taken by the respondents. We are not persuaded that the amount provided in the accounts really represented the true measure of their loss. The accounts, in our view, represent at most an equivocal statement or an estimate of their claim at that time. They were certainly not precluded thereby from pursuing their claim against the appellants.
 Waiver of tort 
The appellants also relied on the settlement reached with Sudagu Dianta in support of another argument, and it is this. By accepting the sum of $206,800 from Sudagu Dianta in settlement of their claim they had, in effect, ratified the unauthorized delivery of the machines to Sudagu Dianta and thereby had waived the tort committed by the appellants. In other words, the respondents had elected to affirm and ratified the wrongful delivery and having so elected they cannot claim against the appellants damages for the loss of the same machines. Again, we are unable to accept this argument. In this case, both the appellants and Sudagu Dianta were tortfeasors. The respondents were entitled to pursue their claims against Sudagu Dianta as well as the appellants either together at the same time or separately at different times. Having obtained payment from Sudagu Dianta which did not fully satisfy their loss they were entitled to pursue their claim against the appellants for the balance of their loss. It cannot be said that having come to a settlement with and received a payment from Sudagu Dianta they have thereby elected to waive the tort against the appellants.
The appellants relied on the case of 
 Verschures Creameries Ltd v Hull And Netherlands Steamship Co Ltd 
 
[1921] 2 KB 608
. The facts in that case were quite different. There, the defendants who were carriers and forwarding agents were authorized by the owners to carry the goods to Hull and thence to a customer in Manchester. When the goods arrived at Hull the owners instructed the agents not to deliver the goods to the customer. However, contrary to this instruction, the agents nonetheless delivered the goods to the customer. The owners thereafter invoiced the goods to the customer and not having received any payment sued him and recovered judgment for the price of the goods sold and delivered and following that proceeded with bankruptcy proceedings against the customer. It was held that in those circumstances, the owner had elected to treat the delivery to the customer as authorized and they could not thereafter pursue the action against the agent for misdelivery. Atkin LJ said, at p 612: 
 
... The owners treated the goods as having rightly come to his hands; they sued him for the price of them, recovered judgment against him, and made him a bankrupt. Thereby they affirmed and ratified the act of the forwarding agents. Having done that they cannot afterwards sue the agents as having acted in breach of their mandate.
 
 
 
Clearly the position here is quite different. The respondents had not in any way treated the delivery of the machines to Sudagu Dianta as having been authorized and there was no ratification of the wrongful delivery thereof, express or implied. They recovered what they could from Sudagu Dianta and thereafter pursued their claim against the appellants. Such courses of action they were fully entitled to take.
A case which is closer to the one at hand is 
 Rice v Reed 
[1901] 1 QB 54. There, the plaintiffs` servant, S, wrongfully appropriated their goods and sold them to the defendants who were aware that S was improperly dealing with the goods. The plaintiffs brought an action against S and subsequently a settlement was reached whereby S agreed that a sum with his bank should be paid to the plaintiffs in full settlement of all claims against S without prejudice to their claim against the defendants, and this agreement was subsequently embodied in a consent order. Before the agreement was reached, the plaintiffs had instituted an action against the defendants claiming damages for conversion of the goods. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the plaintiffs had not, by suing S and coming to an agreement with him, elected to affirm the sale and waive the tort against the defendants. Lord Russell of Killowen CJ, after referring to the two old cases, 
 Morris & Anor v Robinson 
(1824) 3 B & C 196; 107 ER 706 and 
 Burn v Morris 
(1834) 4 Tyr 485, came to the following conclusion, at pp 64-65: 
 
... Those cases seem to establish two propositions: first, that an application for the proceeds of goods said to have been tortiously dealt with is not conclusive proof of election to affirm the transaction; and, secondly, that the receipt of part of the proceeds is not conclusive proof of election.
 
 
 
In the present case it is to be noticed that the money was obtained from the bank under a compromise, and one cannot shut one`s eyes to this fact, when determining what is the proper inference to be drawn from the circumstances of the case, namely, that the receipt of the money by the plaintiff was in relief of the defendant, and went in diminution of the damages payable by him, as the defendant will get the benefit of the money received from the bank. Upon the whole, I have arrived at the conclusion that there are no such circumstances in this case as to oblige the court to say that the plaintiff has, by his dealings with Soltau, conclusively elected to affirm the sale of the sawdust by Soltau to the defendant so as to be estopped from maintaining this action against the defendant. The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed.
Precisely the same thing occurred here. The payment of $206,800 by Sudagu Dianta was in diminution of the damages payable to the respondents and there was no circumstance to suggest that by dealing with Sudagu Dianta and recovering that sum from them the respondents had elected to affirm and ratify the unauthorized delivery of the exhibits to Sudagu Dianta and waive the tort against the appellants.
 Quantum 
We now turn to the quantum of damages. The respondents computed their losses as follows:
 
 
(i) One unit Wadkin Robinson MoulderGA 220/2S + 1 and accessories $ 106,267.87 
 
plus stocking cost/freight $ 113,175.28 
 
plus profit margin of 25% $ 150,900.37 $ 150,900.37 
 
(ii) One unit Wadkin Robinson Moulder 
 
GB220M and accessories $ 52,245.53 
 
plus stocking cost/freight $ 55,641.49 
 
plus profit margin of 25% $ 74,188.65 $ 74,188.65 
 
(iii) One unit Wadkin Robinson Moulder 
 
XJ220 and accessories $ 206,033.80 
 
plus stocking cost/freight $ 219,426.00 
 
plus profit margin of 25% $ 292,568.00 $ 292,568.00 
 
(iv) One unit Wadkin Robinson Moulder 
 
NXU 230S $ 30,424.79 
 
plus stocking cost/freight $ 32,402.40 
 
plus profit margin of 25% $ 43,203.20 $ 43,203.20 
 
(v) One unit Wadkin Robinson Cross-Cut Saw, 
 
model BRA 350/4 $ 3,744.54 
 
plus stocking cost/freight $ 3,987.94 
 
plus profit margin of 25% $ 5,317.25 $ 5,317.25 
 
(vi) One unit of CKD direct extraction equipment 
 
(the dust extractor; converted to S$) $22,212.48 
 
plus stocking cost/freight $23,656.29 
 
plus profit margin of 25% $31,541.72 $31,541.72 
 
$597,719.19
  
 
 
The total of the amounts came to $597,719.19. The learned judge allowed an amount of $561,600 for the first five machines and an amount of RM32,000 for the last item. In making this award, the learned judge allowed to be added to the value of the machines the `stocking` costs and profits margin as claimed by the respondents.
The appellants argued that the amount awarded by the learned judge was not supported by the evidence and, in particular, there was no evidence supporting the claim for stocking costs and profits. The true value of the machines, so it was submitted, was $237,000.00. The basis for this argument was the note in the audited accounts of the respondents for the year ended 31 December 1988 which was to the effect that a sum of $237,000 represented their claim against their handling agent and the absence of such note in their accounts for the subsequent year which were prepared after the receipt of $206,800 from Sudagu Dianta. We have dealt with these aspects of the accounts and need say no more. Suffice it to say here that these accounts provide no basis for such argument.
The appellants next relied on certain declarations made by Swee and furnished to the appellants in the course of the latter transporting the exhibits of the respondents to Jakarta for the exhibition. In these declarations various sums were stated as the values of the exhibits, including five of the machines in question, and the total value of the five machines in one of the declarations amounted to US$113,604, which converted into Singapore currency at the prevailing rate of exchange (US$1:S$2) would be S$227,208. It is unclear in what circumstances the declarations were made. It appears to us that these were shipping documents, and the amounts stated were c i f values for five exhibits only. Swee in his evidence said that they were below the market values. Although these declarations were the respondents` documents and could amount to admission of the values of the exhibits, such values are not conclusive. For all these reasons we are unable to accept the appellants` contention that the true value of the machines was only $237,000.00.
In the alternative, the appellants argued that the true value amounted to $420,925. The appellants relied first on a letter written on behalf of the respondents to the appellants dated 15 December 1988 in which the respondents gave the total value of the machines as approximately $450,000.00. Secondly, there was evidence from one John Morris, the managing director of the respondents, who testified that the total cost of the machine without the element of profits added was $448,289.40. The witness also agreed in evidence that the cost of the machines as set out in their computation amounted to $420,925.00, without taking into account stocking costs and profits. Further, the figure of $450,000 was also adopted in the affidavit of one Pakirisamy Sivaraman, the commercial manager of the respondents.
We think there is some merit in this argument. The machines in question were supplied to the respondents from or through their parent company. The basic costs, ie the costs without adding the stocking costs and profit margin as claimed, were derived from the invoices of these machines received by the respondents from their parent company or associate company. These invoices had been produced by the respondents in evidence. They were only evidence of the fact that the respondents had received such invoices. They were, of course, not evidence of the truth of the contents. In so far as the truth of the contents, the respondents relied on the oral evidence of their witnesses. First, there was Pakirisamy Sivaraman who testified the costs of the machines. There was also the evidence of John Morris whose evidence was to similar effect. There was, therefore, evidence of the costs of these machines. The learned judge accepted such evidence. However, as regards the stocking costs and profits, no evidence was adduced to prove these two items. These two components should therefore be excluded in the computation. Excluding these two components the value of the machines would amount to $420,929.01 (and not $420,925). We would therefore award to the respondents the amount of $420,929.01 as the total value of the machines. From this sum should be deducted the amount of $206,800.00 paid by Sudagu Dianta and the amount of $29,447.20 due to the appellants, and the balance payable to the respondents is $184,681.81.
 Interest 
The learned judge awarded interest to the respondents from the time of the loss, ie the date of misdelivery to Sudagu Dianta, to the date of judgment. The appellants contended that the respondents had been guilty of inordinate delay in pursuing the claim: there was a lapse of about 21/2 years between the date of wrongful delivery of the exhibits and the date when the respondents brought their claim. We think that this complaint is justified and the interest should be awarded to the respondents for the period from the date of the respondents` counterclaim, ie 26 April 1991 to the date of judgment, ie 30 July 1994.
 Conclusion 
We vary the order below by reducing the amount awarded to the respondents to $184,681.81 with interest thereon at 6% pa from 26 April 1991 to 30 July 1994. To that extent the appeal is allowed.
 Costs 
We now come to the question of costs. The appellants have failed in four of the issues and succeeded only on the last issue on the quantum of damages. In the circumstances they should bear part of the costs of the appeal, and we would award to the respondents one-quarter of the costs of the appeal. We so order. There will also be the usual consequential order for payment to the respondents or their solicitors the deposit in court as security for costs.

This was an appeal from a departmental prosecution. The appellant company pleaded guilty in the district court to an amended charge as follows: 
 
You, Chen Hock Heng Textile Printing Pte Ltd 47 Sungei Kadut Street (Singapore 2572) are charged that you, after having been convicted on the 26 November 1993 in Subordinate Court No 13N of an offence under s 5(1) of the Building Control Act (Cap 29), for carrying out building works, to wit, erected sheds at front measuring approximately 16m x 9m and at side measuring approximately 10.6m x 5.5m at 47 Sungei Kadut St 6, Singapore 2572 without the approval from the Building Authority in contravention of s 5(1) of the Building Control Act (Cap 29), did continue such offence from the said date of conviction until 23 June 1995. The period of default being from 19 October 1994 to 23 June 1995, to wit, 247 days and you have thereby committed an [sic] continuing offence punishable under s 5(3) of the said Act.
 
 
 
The statement of facts, apart from the appellant`s antecedents, merely said that the facts were as stated in the charge.
The complainant`s statement of facts revealed that: 
 
The defendant is Chen Hock Heng Printing Pte Ltd, a company incorporated in Singapore with is registered address at No 47 Sungei Kadut St 6, Singapore 2572.
 
 
 
On 26 November 1993 the said defendant was convicted and fined $6,500 for an offence under s 5(3) of the Building Control Act (Cap 29) in respect of the unauthorized sheds erected at the factory premises at No 47 Sungei Kadut St 6, Singapore.
On 23 June 1995 I revisited the premises at No 47 Sungei Kadut St 6 and found that two sheds measuring approximately 26m x 9m and 10.6m x 5.5m still continued to remain erected at the front and the side of the factory premises, respectively in contravention of s 5(1) of the Building Control Act.
The defendant has thereby committed a continuing offence from the said date of conviction until 23 June 1995. The period of continuous default being from 19 October 1994 to 23 June 1995, to wit, 247 days, an offence punishable under s 5(3) of Building Control Act (Cap 29).
It was apparent that the learned district judge took this into account because at p 3 of his grounds, he stated: 
 
I considered the mitigation plea advanced by counsel for the defendant company. It would not be a difficult task to dismantle the sheds as they were not permanent or solid structures. They had no walls. The sheds were not demolished apparently because the company still wanted to use them to shelter its bales of textiles. The illness of its managing director was also cited as a reason why the company was still infringing the law. Although defence counsel submitted that the infringement was not blatant, I could not accept this in view of the previous occasions the company had been convicted for continuing the offence. I took into account, however, that about three quarters of the structures had been demolished.
 
 
 
The appellant was convicted upon its guilty charge and was fined $800 a day, amounting to a total of $197,600. On 4 November 1995, the appellants` then solicitors filed a notice of appeal against sentence only. On 24 November 1995, the appellant`s present solicitors filed the petition of appeal. In it, the appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence.
It was apparent that the gravamen of the charge was that the sheds, constructed by the appellant without prior approval, and for which the appellant had been fined $6,500, still remained on the premises and were being used by the appellant. In fact, these were the only facts before the court.
Before me, counsel for the appellant contended, and the learned DPP conceded, that the facts as stated did not constitute any offence under s 5 of the Building Control Act (Cap 29) (the Act). In my view, the concession by the learned DPP was rightly made. Section 5 of the Act, so far as relevant, provides: 
 
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no person shall commence or carry out, or permit or authorise the commencement or carrying out of, any building works unless -
(a) the Building Authority has approved all the plans of the building works under section 6; and 
(b) there is in force a permit granted by the Building Authority under section 7 to carry out the building works shown in the approved plans of the building works.
 
 
 
...
(3) Any person who contravenes or fails to comply with subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $1,000 for every day during which the offence continues after conviction.
 
 
 
There was no allegation of any building works being carried out by any person at all, much less the appellant, during the relevant period. Hence, no offence under s 5 could have been committed by the appellant. Section 5 deals with the commencement or carrying out of building works. It has nothing to do with what is to be done to any structure which had been built in contravention of s 5. This is covered by s 13, which empowers the Building Authority to make the relevant orders. Failure to comply with any such order is an offence under s 13(4), and an offence under s 13(4) may be a continuing one. It is quite clear that the scheme of the Act requires the Building Authority to make a decision as to what is to be done with the unauthorized structure that has been constructed. It is up to the authority then to issue the relevant order. What is not contemplated is that an offence is committed by merely allowing the structure to remain intact. It does not follow that because a structure is unauthorized, failure to remove it is an offence. Hence, the facts as admitted by the appellant did not disclose the offence as charged or, indeed, any offence at all, as it was not alleged that the authority had issued any order under s 13.
Reference need only be made to the Court of Appeal`s decision in the landmark case of 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
  . In that case, a five-judge Court of Appeal dealt with the question of the significance of the statement of facts, the trial court`s duty when recording a guilty plea, and what is to be done when the statement of facts does not disclose the offence charged. There, I said at p 145: 
 
... There is no provision within the terms of s 180 or indeed within the rest of the Criminal Procedure Code directing the court to consider a statement of facts before it accepts the accused`s plea of guilty. When an accused person pleads guilty, what he pleads to is the charge. Frequently, however, an outline of facts is recited to the court upon his pleading guilty, this being done orally in short straightforward cases. In more involved cases, the outline may be in the form of a written statement ... . The original purpose of the outline of facts was to provide judges with some form of assistance in assessing the penalty to be meted out and to enable the appellate court to assess the appropriateness of the sentence in the event it was called into question ... .
 
 
 
Over the years, however, the courts have tended towards the view that the tendering of a statement of facts constitutes an essential part of the criminal procedure of the courts. Most of the reported cases on this point have arisen from magistrate`s appeals to the various High Courts of what is now Malaysia ... The present position in Singapore was best summarized by LP Thean J in 
Chota bin Abdul Razak v PP
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 77
  at p 81: 
 
`... what is required is the admission by the accused of the offence without qualification. It is, therefore, essential that what the accused admits in the statement of facts contains all the ingredients that constitute the offence with which he is charged. It is not essential, however, that the accused should admit every iota of facts contained in the statement. If what he admits contains all the ingredients that constitute the offence and what he disputes or does not admit is irrelevant or immaterial to the offence, such an admission, in my opinion, is sufficient for the purpose of s 180(b), and the court should accept his plea of guilty. Such an admission is an admission without qualification of the offence alleged against him.`
 
 
 
The above pronouncement, to our minds, places in proper perspective the role of the statement of facts. We reiterate, therefore, that, in our judgment, the recording of a statement of facts by the court following an accused`s plea of guilt, which began as a matter of practice which evolved primarily as a means of assisting judges to determine the appropriate sentence, has evolved into a legal duty on the court to record a statement of facts and to scrutinize the statement of facts for the explicit purpose of ensuring that all the elements of the charge are made out therein.
 
 
 
While the proper role of the statement of facts is that which we have set out above, it is also to be noted that over the years a practice has grown for applications to be made to the High Court to exercise its powers of revision under s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code on the ground that the statement of facts does not satisfy every element of the offence charged. As the accused in such cases will have pleaded guilty in a subordinate court to the charge, the application for revision usually arises because he is dissatisfied with the nature or extent of the sentence and is then advised not just to appeal against the sentence (which he is entitled to do) but also to mount an indirect appeal against conviction (which he is not entitled to do) by an application for revision on the ground that the statement of facts does not satisfy every element of the offence. In such cases, the High Court is capable of reviewing the conviction in exercise of its powers of revision, but it must be stressed that the very scope of these powers oblige the court to act with great circumspection and only where it is manifestly plain that the offence charged is nowhere disclosed in the statement of facts tendered.
In that case, the accused had pleaded guilty to a charge of abetting robbery with hurt. On his appeal against sentence to the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal reopened the conviction after having occasion to refer to the statement of facts presented in the court below. The Court of Appeal noted that it does not have the far-reaching revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court over the subordinate courts by virtue of ss 266, 268 and other sections of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). It also noted that s 54(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) does not alter the rule in s 44(2) of the same Act barring appeals against conviction by accused persons who pleaded guilty. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal held that it was empowered under s 54(1) to reopen the conviction. A conviction for abetting housebreaking in order to commit theft was substituted.
In my view, the present case fell squarely within the situation contemplated in 
 Mok Swee Kok v PP 
. There can hardly be another case in which it is more `manifestly plain that the offence charged is nowhere disclosed in the statement of facts.`
However, in this case, what counsel for the appellant did was to challenge the correctness of the conviction in the petition of appeal, despite the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty to the charge. Section 244 of the CPC states quite clearly that: 
 
When an accused has pleaded guilty and been convicted by a District Court or Magistrate`s Court on that plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence.
 
 
 
A similar provision appears in s 44(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. While there are cases from Malaysia which appear to support the proposition that, in certain limited cases, an appeal against conviction can still be mounted, I am of the view that the proper interpretation of the decision in 
 Mok Swee Kok v PP 
 is that the correct procedure is to apply for revision. The revisionary power given to the High Court is very wide and there is no need to stretch the meaning of other provisions in the CPC in order to do justice in a case such as this. In the present case, the error was compounded by the fact that the notice of appeal stated that the appeal was only against sentence.
Nevertheless, the error in the present case was so fundamental that the court should still exercise its extensive powers of revision under ss 266 and 268 of the CPC and quash the conviction. These provisions allow the High Court to exercise its power of revision on its own motion in any case which has come to its knowledge.
That being the case, it seemed to me that the proper thing to do was to dismiss the appeal, but, at the same time, to exercise my powers of revision to quash the conviction and sentence. The fines paid by the appellant should also be returned. I ordered accordingly.
 Appeal dismissed, but conviction and sentence quashed under power of revision.",1996-03-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

s 83 Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1994 Ed)
 
In these proceedings, the abovenamed Narmal Singh s/o Fauja Singh (the respondent), an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court, was ordered to show cause why he should not be dealt with under s 83(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1994 Ed) (the Act). The proceedings arose from a determination by the Disciplinary Committee appointed by the Chief Justice under s 90(1) of the Act that in relation to the information laid by the Council of the Law Society cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 83 of the Act. At the conclusion of the hearing we ordered that the respondent be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors and now give our reasons for the order.
The respondent was admitted as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore on 8 November 1989. He commenced practice as a legal assistant in M/s Assomull, Pereira & Partners in 1989, and later went on to practise as a partner of M/s Gurdaib, Cheong & Narmal until August 1993.
 The respondent`s convictions 
On 16 August 1993 the respondent was charged with six offences in the district court. He claimed trial and was convicted on 3 September 1993 on the following four charges:
 
 
(i) in DAC 01079/92, a charge under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (PCA) of having corruptly offered gratification to one Abdul Aziz bin Mohamed Noor (Aziz), a police officer in the Singapore Police Force, a gratification of a sum of $3,000 as an inducement to Aziz to render assistance in relation to one Tan Be How (Tan), who was wanted by the police for investigation into a series of housebreaking cases; 
 
(ii) in DAC 01081/92, a charge under s 5(a)(i) of the PCA of having corruptly received $5,000 as gratification from Tan for his proposed assistance in getting Tan free from charges in relation to housebreaking offences; 
 
(iii) in DAC 01082/92, a charge under s 5(a)(i) of the PCA of having corruptly solicited from Tan $5,000 as gratification for his proposed assistance in getting Tan free from the said charges; and 
 
(iv) in DAC 01080/92, a charge under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) of having committed criminal breach of trust of the sum of $500 belonging to Assomull, Pereira & Partners in his capacity as a legal assistant.
  
 
 
As regards the other two charges, the respondent was acquitted. He was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 18 months and was also ordered to pay a penalty of $5,000, and in default of payment to serve a term of imprisonment of five months. Against his convictions and sentences he appealed but later he withdrew his appeal. He has since served the term of imprisonment.
 The Disciplinary Committee proceedings 
Upon the respondent`s convictions of the four offences, the Council of the Law Society proceeded under s 85(2) of the Act and laid an information touching upon the respondent`s conduct to the chairman of the inquiry panel, and as a result an Inquiry Committee was duly empanelled to inquire into the information. The Inquiry Committee recommended that a formal investigation be held by a Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the information, and accordingly on application by the Council of the Law Society, a Disciplinary Committee was duly appointed by the Chief Justice on 8 March 1995 under s 90 of the Act.
Before the Disciplinary Committee the respondent admitted the charges. On 30 August 1995, the Disciplinary Committee concluded its investigation and reported that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 83(2)(a) of the Act. Accordingly, the Law Society applied for an order requiring the respondent to show cause before this court why he should not be dealt with under the provisions of s 83(1) of the Act.
 The show cause proceedings 
Before us, counsel for the respondent stated that he did not intend to show cause, but only to raise some matters for consideration in mitigation. Counsel acknowledged that it was not permissible to challenge the respondent`s convictions. He urged the court nonetheless to consider the reliability and cogency of the evidence of Aziz and Tan before the district court and sought to show the weakness of the prosecution case against the respondent. We found no merit whatsoever in this submission. It is manifestly clear from s 83(5) of the Act that this court cannot go behind the respondent`s convictions. The strength or weakness of the prosecution`s case before the district court is irrelevant in these proceedings.
Counsel further pleaded that the respondent could be given a punishment that might leave him a firm hope of returning to the profession one day. It was suggested that a suspension from practice might meet the ends of justice. We were unable to agree. In considering the appropriate penalty to impose, we could not ignore the gravity of the offences and the circumstances in which they were committed. The respondent had been convicted of four offences altogether, although the first three of the offences arose out of the same `transaction`. This `transaction` revolved around the respondent corruptly offering gratification to Aziz, a police officer, in order that Tan would be let off from police investigation into his role in the housebreaking offences. At the same time, the respondent himself solicited and received $5,000 as gratification from Tan for his assistance in that scheme. The gravity of these offences was compounded by the fact that the respondent committed them while acting on behalf of his client. As an officer of the court he sought to evade the due process of the law and pervert the course of justice. Such conduct of an advocate and solicitor is extremely reprehensible. We have expressed similar views in 
Law Society of Singapore v Dhanwant Singh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 429
  and we need not repeat them here. We need only add that the offences committed in the present case were far more serious. The fourth offence was one of criminal breach of trust of $500. The amount might be small but the element of dishonesty existed.
The offences of which the respondent was convicted demonstrated his extreme defects in character. In our judgment, his conduct merited an order that he should be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors, and we accordingly made the order.
 Order accordingly.",1996-02-02 00:00:00,SG High Court

The appellant pleaded guilty before the magistrate`s court to a charge of criminal trespass, contrary to s 441 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and punishable under s 447. The magistrate sentenced him to five weeks` imprisonment.
The appellant appealed against his sentence. He also filed a number of motions and applied for criminal revision (Cr Rev 13/95) to set aside his guilty plea. Suffice it to say that the motions have all either been dismissed or withdrawn. After numerous adjournments (which, together with the motions, would explain the number of deputy public prosecutors involved in this case), I heard the application for criminal revision on 19 March 1996, before hearing this appeal. The application was dismissed. That being so, this case was treated like any other appeal against sentence from a conviction upon a plea of guilt.
After hearing both Mr Tang for the appellant and the deputy public prosecutor, Mr Wong Keen Onn, I dismissed the appeal. As this appeal raised the point of whether the UK Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (the UK Act) is applicable in Singapore, I felt it necessary to write short grounds to put this issue to rest.
The admitted statement of facts, and the appellant`s mitigation, showed that the appellant was a managing director of the Xin Zhang Jiang group of restaurants. He was unhappy about the Ministry of Labour`s restrictions on the employment of foreign workers and a raid conducted on his restaurant. In August 1993, he began writing articles to comment on the ministry`s policies. He also printed a number of pamphlets for distribution.
On 17 September 1993, the appellant was found distributing pamphlets at the Ministry of Labour Building. At the time, the appellant was wearing a plastic handcuff on his left hand. The complainant, one James Pang, who was the head of the Building Management Unit at the ministry, was annoyed over the appellant`s act. He called the police, who arrested the appellant.
The magistrate considered a number of matters when sentencing the appellant. So far as the factual matters and the inferences she drew therefrom are concerned, nothing more need be said, save that her findings were justified in view of what was admitted in the statement of facts and the appellant`s mitigation plea.
The magistrate took into account the appellant`s three previous convictions in the 1970s when sentencing. These convictions were under ss 500 and 505 of the Penal Code, namely, criminal defamation and making statements conducing to public mischief respectively. Mr Tang`s argument was that these were spent convictions under the UK Act and should be disregarded. In any event, the offences were not similar offences.
On the UK Act, Mr Tang relied on s 5 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the CPC). This states: 
 
As regards matters of criminal procedure for which no special provision has been made by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force in Singapore the law relating to criminal procedure for the time being in force in England shall be applied so far as the procedure does not conflict or is not inconsistent with this Code and can be made auxiliary thereto.
 
 
 
The argument was that the UK Act was imported into Singapore by s 5 of the CPC. I was unable to accept this argument. First, the exercise of a judge`s discretion when sentencing is not a matter of criminal procedure. Sentencing principles and the application of these principles are matters of substantive law. Textbooks and law reports may, for convenience, put sentencing under the heading `criminal procedure`, but that is a completely different matter.
In 
 PP v Mohamed Ismail 
 
 
[1984] 2 MLJ 219
 , it was held that an amendment removing the court`s discretion, by making certain penalties mandatory instead of discretionary, when sentencing, was caught by art 11 of the Constitution if it purported to apply to offences committed before the amendment came into effect. This showed that matters of sentencing are matters of substantive law. If the amendment in 
 Mohamed Ismail 
 only dealt with criminal procedure, then it would not have been caught by art 11.
Second, a perusal of the UK Act revealed that this piece of legislation deals with matters of evidence and substantive rights. The main operative provision in the UK Act is s 4. Mr Tang relied on s 4(1). This states: 
 
Subject to sections 7 and 8 below, a person who has become a rehabilitated person for the purposes of this Act in respect of a conviction shall be treated for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed or been charged with or prosecuted for or convicted of or sentenced for the offence or offences which were the subject of that conviction; and, notwithstanding the provision of any other enactment or rule of law to the contrary, but subject as aforesaid -
 
 
 
(a) no evidence shall be admissible in any proceedings before a judicial authority exercising its jurisdiction or functions in Great Britain to prove that any such person has committed or been charged with or prosecuted for or convicted of or sentenced for any offence which was the subject of a spent conviction; and
 
 
 
 
(b) a person shall not, in any such proceedings, be asked, and, if asked, shall not be required to answer, any question relating to his past which cannot be answered without acknowledging or referring to a spent conviction or spent convictions or any circumstances ancillary thereto.
  
 
 
However, it can be seen from sub-ss (2) and (3), which it is unnecessary to reproduce here, that the right not to disclose previous spent convictions extends to situations where the information was sought other than in proceedings before a judicial authority. This includes obligations to disclose arising under any rule or law or even by agreement. The UK Act even allows defamation actions to be brought. Clearly, the UK Act deals with substantive rights and hence substantive law. It is not concerned with mere procedure.
So far as s 4(1) of the UK Act provides that no evidence of a spent conviction shall be admissible and that a person need not answer any question relating to those convictions, that is a matter of evidence and not procedure. It is clear that s 5 of the CPC does not apply to matters of evidence. Reference need only be made to 
 Ng Kwee Piow v R 
 
 
[1960] MLJ 278
 . Furthermore, this part of s 4 merely gives effect to substantive rights which were granted by the UK Act.
In any event, the UK Act does not have the far-reaching effect suggested by Mr Tang. Section 4 of the UK Act is subject to s 7, the relevant part of which states: 
 
(2) Nothing in section 4(1) above shall affect the determination of any issue, or prevent the admission or requirement of any evidence, relating to a person`s previous convictions or to circumstances ancillary thereto -
 
 
 
(a) in any criminal proceedings before a court in Great Britain (including any appeal or reference in a criminal matter) ...
 
 
 
This appeared to me to take the UK Act completely out of the ambit of s 5 of the CPC, even if it relates to procedure, because it does not apply in criminal proceedings. It does not affect `the determination of any issue`, including sentencing. The spirit of the UK Act was applied to criminal proceedings by way of 
 Practice Direction (Crime: Spent Convictions) 
 
[1975] 1 WLR 1065
. However, I was unable to see how the disembodied spirit of the UK Act can manifest itself in Singapore through s 5 of the CPC. Furthermore, there was no absolute bar against considering spent convictions when sentencing. There, Lord Widgery CJ instructed: 
 
7 When passing sentence the judge should make no reference to a spent conviction unless it is necessary to do so for the purpose of explaining the sentence to be passed.
 
 
 
The implication is that spent convictions can still be relevant for sentencing. Otherwise there will be nothing about the sentence that needs to be explained by reference to the spent convictions.
For these reasons, I was of the view that there was no merit in this submission, and that the UK Act has no application in Singapore.
Turning to the previous convictions themselves, they were not strictly convictions for similar offences, as the ingredients of these offences and the present one did not share any common element. However, it would be wrong to treat them as though they were totally irrelevant, for in the broad sense, they shared some similarities, in that they involved, at least, some element of mischievous intention. I use the word `mischievous` in the broad sense understood by laymen.
In Singapore, previous offences, even if they were not strictly speaking of a similar nature, have been taken into account when sentencing. This was done in 
 JB Jeyaretnam v PP and another appeal 
 
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 129
  and in 
Lim Kim Seng & Anor v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 743
  . However, as was said by KS Rajah JC in 
 Lim Kim Seng v PP 
, it would be wrong to treat those offences as though they were similar offences in the strict sense of the word.
The effect that these convictions have on sentencing in any case must depend on the facts of the case. In my view, relevant considerations would be the number and nature of these previous convictions. Similarly, for convictions which occurred a long time ago, it would also be relevant to consider the length of time during which the defendant has maintained a blemish-free record. All these are part and parcel of the convicted person`s antecedents which the court should take into account.
In the present case, taking into account the circumstances in which the offence was committed and the appellant`s previous convictions (while bearing in mind that these were not strictly similar offences and that they were old convictions), I was of the view that the sentence of five weeks` imprisonment imposed by the magistrate was not manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I dismissed his appeal.

The appellant pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to the following charge of dangerous driving: 
 
You, Chue Woon Wai, are charged that on 12 August 1995 at about 8.19pm along Geylang Road at the junction with Geylang Lor 1, Singapore, did drive motor taxi No SHA 8400B in a manner which was dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time or which might reasonably be expected to be on the road, to wit, by failing to conform to traffic red light signals, thus collided into motorcycle No FH 3769H, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).
 
 
 
He was fined $1,000 and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for one year. He filed an appeal against the order of disqualification, and subsequently also filed Crim M 6/96 (the motion) for leave to adduce fresh evidence. I shall deal briefly with the motion first.
 The motion 
The motion related to two matters. First, the appellant claimed that the weather conditions at the time of the collision were not as stated in the statement of facts. He sought to show that the road surface was slippery on account of rain. Next, he sought to show that the overhead pole of the traffic light facing his approach along Geylang Road was not in operation at the material time. Counsel for the appellant informed me that these issues had not been raised earlier, primarily because the appellant had not been represented in the proceedings below. I dismissed the motion as I saw no reason why the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence and presented below. There was no suggestion that the appellant had been deprived of his right to counsel. He had chosen not to take advantage of this right.
 The appeal against disqualification 
The salient facts were set out in the charge. In addition, the statement of facts, which the appellant admitted to, revealed that both the motor cycle rider and his pillion rider were injured. The rider`s left leg was fractured and he had to be hospitalized. The pillion rider sustained lacerations on both legs and hands and was treated as an outpatient. Both vehicles were seriously damaged. At the time of the accident, the traffic flow was heavy. The weather was fine, visibility was clear and the road surface was dry.
In mitigation, the appellant said that he had been driving for the past 12 years. He claimed that the road was slippery. When he `jammed` his brakes, this caused the vehicle to skid, thus resulting in the collision. The magistrate considered that the critical fact was that the appellant had failed to conform with the traffic red light signal. Moreover, serious injuries and vehicle damage were caused. In the magistrate`s judgment, an order for disqualification for one year was warranted.
On appeal, counsel for the appellant argued inter alia that, before deciding to impose the disqualification, the magistrate had some undefined responsibility to explain the possibility of disqualification to the appellant, and to ask him to state whether there was any `special reason` for not imposing the disqualification. It was argued that the magistrate had erred in not discharging this responsibility, and the order for disqualification should thus not have been made.
The concept of `special reasons` is contained in various provisions of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed) (the Act). It exists in the specific context where an order of disqualification is made mandatory upon conviction of certain offences: see ss 64(2), 67(2), 68(2), 79(4) and 116(5) of the Act. Mandatory disqualification in relation to an offence of dangerous driving under s 64(1) will only be triggered upon `a second or subsequent conviction`, since s 64(2) states: 
 
On a second or subsequent conviction under this section, the convicting court shall exercise the power conferred by section 42 of ordering that the offender shall be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence unless the court, having regard to the lapse of time since the date of the previous or last previous conviction, 
 or for any other special reason
, thinks fit to order otherwise, but this provision shall not be construed as affecting the right of the court to exercise the power aforesaid on a first conviction. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In the present case, the appellant had no previous convictions under s 64. The magistrate, in proceeding to disqualify him from driving, was exercising his discretionary power conferred pursuant to s 42(1) of the Act, which reads: 
 
A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit except that if the court thinks fit, any disqualification imposed under this section may be limited to the driving of a motor vehicle of the same class or description as the motor vehicle in relation to which the offence was committed.
 
 
 
Counsel submitted that the court had a duty to ask the accused to raise any special reasons where he was caught by a provision which attracted mandatory disqualification. Counsel reasoned that the same duty should be imposed, a fortiori, on a court which is deliberating on the exercise of its discretionary power to order disqualification.
With respect, I could not agree with counsel`s submissions. From the provisions of the Act, it is clear that the concept of `special reasons` plays no part in relation to the court`s discretionary power under s 42(1) of the Act to impose disqualification. A fortiori, the court does not owe an accused person any duty under s 42(1) to ask him to state special reasons before sentence. Even if s 64(2) had been operative, it could not have been Parliament`s intent that the court should undertake the responsibility of eliciting special reasons from the accused. Certainly, the relevant provisions contain no indication of such intent. I am also not aware of, nor was counsel able to point to, any rule of practice which supports his submission.
To bolster his arguments, counsel relied on the following dicta of Silke J from 
 Lo Nyuk Fah v PP 
 
 
[1966] 2 MLJ 206
  (at p 207): 
 
... the accused should be given the opportunity to bring to the notice of the court any special reasons or special circumstances he may have as to why disqualification should not be imposed. This should be recorded and the evidence of the accused should be on oath.
 
 
 
In 
 Lo Nyuk Fah 
`s case, Silke J observed that there was `no proof of the previous conviction and no opportunity was given to the appellant to put forward any special circumstances`. In Silke J`s view, this occasioned a failure of justice. I did not find 
 Lo Nyuk Fah 
`s case to be of any real assistance. Regrettably, the reported grounds of Silke J`s judgment shed little light as to why the appellant had not been given an opportunity to put forward special circumstances. Indeed, it was unclear how the appellant had been deprived of his opportunity to state any special reasons. There was no indication whether the appellant had even made any submissions in mitigation before sentence. In the premises, I was not persuaded that Silke J had laid down a general principle imposing some responsibility on the court to ascertain whether the appellant had any special reasons to mention before making a disqualification order.
In my opinion, the onus lies on an accused person to raise `special reasons` for the court`s consideration, if indeed any such reasons exist. This would be so irrespective of whether the court is dealing with mandatory or discretionary disqualification. Had the accused claimed trial to the charge, these reasons should, and invariably would, have been raised in his evidence during the hearing. In any event, they would have surfaced when the accused, upon conviction and prior to sentence, was called upon to enter a plea in mitigation. He may well decide not to say anything in mitigation. He does so in the exercise of his own better judgment. The court can only assume that he knows what is in his own best interest.
On the other hand, had the accused elected to plead guilty upon counsel`s advice to do so, he would be taken to have understood the nature and consequences of his plea. Even if he had been unrepresented, it may nonetheless be clear that he was cognizant of the nature and consequences of his plea. In the instant case, the record of appeal reflected this. I found it pertinent that in the appellant`s plea in mitigation, he had in substance raised the same points that he sought to rely upon as constituting `special reasons`. This confirmed my view that any relevant reasons should, and invariably would, be brought up by the accused himself.
Counsel further submitted that the magistrate had failed to give sufficient weight to certain mitigating circumstances in this case. Counsel stated that the appellant was married with one daughter. He was the main breadwinner supporting his family, including his aged parents, who are both in their seventies. His wife supplements the family income by doing temporary clerical jobs. He was made a bankrupt in September 1995. Apart from his full-time job as an outdoor marketing salesman, he had taken on a part-time job as a taxi-driver. He had an unblemished driving record over the past 12 years. He had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, and the accident was caused by a momentary lapse of judgment.
I considered that there were valid mitigating circumstances in the present case which counsel had brought to my attention, perhaps rather more persuasively than the appellant might have done in the proceedings below. In particular, his previous good driving record and the fact that he had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity had to be accorded due weight. However, if I may reiterate the views which I have expressed recently in 
Joseph Roland v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 179
  , they would not be `special reasons` which would excuse him from disqualification. In the circumstances of this case, a term of disqualification for six months would be appropriate. Accordingly, I allowed his appeal to that extent.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an action in either contract or tort by Guan Ming Hardware & Engineering Pte Ltd (the plaintiffs) against Chong Yeo & Partners (the first defendant), a firm of solicitors in Singapore and Tongel Yeo (the second defendant), the partner having conduct of the matter whom the plaintiffs had instructed to act on their behalf, for failing to exercise due care, skill and diligence in advising, pursuing claims and enforcing judgments against two companies in Singapore, Argos Engineering Pte Ltd (AE) and Argos Steel Structure (S) Pte Ltd (AS) for S$89,920.40 and S$16,404.70 respectively.
 Background 
In 1991, the plaintiffs were owed sums of money by the two companies, AE and AS. They decided to instruct solicitors to commence proceedings in the courts to recover these amounts. In October 1991, the precise date as to which there is a dispute, the plaintiffs instructed the defendants to act on their behalf and to commence proceedings immediately against AE and AS. Proceedings were commenced and judgments were obtained. However, the plaintiffs discovered to their great chagrin, the recovery proceedings were wholly unsuccessful. The circumstances leading to this result (much of which is disputed), and whether liability for this unsuccessful recovery falls on the defendants is the subject matter of this action.
 The claim 
I will refer to the plaintiffs` case in the context of the plaintiffs` claims against each of the companies AE and AS.
 A AE
(i) The AE cheque
The plaintiffs allege that on or about 24 October 1991, Mr Larry Lee, the plaintiffs` managing director (Mr Lee), sought advice from the second defendant, an advocate and solicitor of some seven years standing, as to whether the plaintiffs ought to accept a cheque for S$20,600.30 received from AE in part payment of the sum owed of S$82,920.40 and that the second defendant`s advice to Mr Lee was to reject the cheque on the grounds that it would complicate the proceedings against AE. The plaintiffs further allege Mr Lee acted on that advice and returned the cheque for S$20,600.30 to AE.
The first ground then of the plaintiffs` claim against the defendants is that the defendants` advice to return the cheque was negligent. Had such advice not been given, the plaintiffs say they would have recovered a sum of S$20,600.30 as early as October 1991 in respect of their claim against AE for S$82,920.40.
(ii) Commencement and conduct of the claim
Next, the plaintiffs allege various instances of failure by the defendants to exercise due care, skill and diligence in the commencement and conduct of the claim against AE. Firstly, they allege the defendants only issued a writ of summons against AE on 24 October 1991 when the plaintiffs say instructions were given by the plaintiffs to the defendants much earlier - in early October 1991. The plaintiffs were not specific about the date except to allege that it would have been on or about 17 October 1991. Secondly, the plaintiffs allege that although appearance was entered by AE on 31 October 1991, it was not until 20 November 1991 - about 20 days later - that the defendants (who had already received the necessary documentary evidence from the plaintiffs to enable them to proceed with a summary judgment application against AE) filed a summary judgment application. The application was set down for a 13 January 1992 hearing. Thirdly, the plaintiffs allege that although AE had failed to file its defence to the claim by 14 November 1991 (the date when its defence was due), the defendants did not, as they could have, enter judgment in default. Fourthly, it is alleged that the defendants could have pressed for a date earlier than 13 January 1992 for the hearing of the summary judgment application but had not done so.
But the gravamen of the plaintiffs` case here and their fifth allegation, is that the defendants filed a defective affidavit in support of the application for summary judgment because at the hearing before the assistant registrar on 13 January 1992, the assistant registrar ruled that the affidavit, which the second defendant said he had prepared, was defective as it did not comply with the recently revised O 14 r 2(8) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (RSC) (the rule). The rule came into effect on 1 August 1991. The assistant registrar considered the defendants ought to have exhibited documentary evidence to that affidavit in support of the plaintiffs` claim, as the rule required. Instead, all that the affidavit did was to refer to the statement of claim that had been filed, allege the sum claimed was due and owing and alleged that there was no defence to the claim. The statement of claim stated: 
 
1 The plaintiffs` claim against the defendants the sum of $82,920.40 in respect of goods sold and delivered to the defendants, at the defendants` request, full particulars of which the defendants are already aware and short particulars whereof as follows:
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
Statement of account as at September 1991 = $82,920.40
 
 
 
2 Despite repeated requests and demands, the defendants have failed, neglected and/or refused to make payment of the said sum of $82,920.40 or any part thereof.
 
 
 
And the plaintiffs claim:
 
 
 
(a) The sum of $82,920.40;
 
 
 
 
(b) Interest at the rate of eight (8%) per cent per annum from the date of issuance of this writ till judgment or payment whichever is the earlier; and 
 
(c) Costs.
  
 
 
In effect, the affidavit was a standard form affidavit prepared in accordance with the requirements of O 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, prior to its revision in August 1991. The omission to exhibit the supporting documents was not caused, the plaintiffs say, by the defendants not having the necessary documentary evidence because the plaintiffs had sent these, well before the hearing of the summary judgment application, to the defendants.
So the hearing on 13 January 1992, despite the defendants` objections, was adjourned to 16 March 1992 to enable the plaintiffs to file a supplementary affidavit to remedy these defects by exhibiting the necessary documentary proof of the plaintiffs` claim and to show that AE had no defence to the claim in accordance with the provisions of the rule. Such further affidavit was then filed, and at the adjourned hearing before the assistant registrar on 16 March 1992, after arguments were heard, the plaintiffs obtained judgment against AE for S$82,920.40, costs and S$1,976.46 in interest. Had the affidavit not been defective, however, the plaintiffs say they would have obtained judgment on their claim against AE on 13 January 1992 which in turn would have allowed the plaintiffs to proceed with execution proceedings much earlier, the inference being that they in such event would have recovered the full amount owed. In support of this assertion, the plaintiffs adduced evidence of a successful recovery by another creditor, First Hydraulics Pte Ltd (First Hydraulics), of sums owed to it by AE. First Hydraulics had obtained judgment against AE on 25 January 1992.
(iii) Execution
Subsequently after judgment was obtained on 16 March 1992, and notwithstanding the second defendant`s advice that winding-up was the most effective recovery remedy, the plaintiffs allege Mr Lee instructed the second defendant to garnish AE`s accounts at two banks immediately but that the defendants did not do so as they only applied for an order nisi on 31 March 1992, an apparent delay of about fifteen days.
The order nisi having been obtained on 31 March 1992, the hearing for an order absolute which was to have been on 4 May 1992, was, however, adjourned indefinitely. That was because on 24 April 1992, a winding-up petition of AE was filed by another of AE`s creditors. The plaintiffs say that had the defendants filed the garnishee proceedings when instructed, and obtained an early return date in early April 1992 instead of on 4 May 1992 for an order absolute, which the plaintiffs further allege the defendants ought to have done as the defendants were also well aware or had been made aware by the plaintiffs of other claims against AE by other creditors, then the order absolute would have been obtained before 24 April 1992 and the amount owed would have been recovered. Even though the winding-up petition, as it turned out, was dismissed on 22 May 1992, its dismissal offered no consolation to the plaintiffs because on 20 May 1992, a receiver of the company had been appointed by yet another creditor.
The plaintiffs assert that each of or all of these instances of the defendants` negligence or breach of duty, deprived the plaintiffs of a successful recovery.
 B AS
The plaintiffs were similarly unsuccessful in their recovery efforts in respect of AS even though the defendants had obtained default judgment against AS in November 1991 for S$16,404.70, interest and costs. The plaintiffs readily admitted they had instructed the defendants not to initiate garnishee proceedings until about late February 1992. The plaintiffs say that was because the plaintiffs did not wish to execute on the judgment until after they had obtained judgment on their claim against AE. The plaintiffs were concerned (a concern they say the defendants were aware of) that execution on their judgment against AS alone, which was for a far smaller sum, would result in the closure by AE of AE`s bank accounts, prejudicing the plaintiffs` claim against AE. Hence the plaintiffs say they were content to wait until 13 January 1992 when they assumed summary judgment against AE would be given. The plaintiffs` complaint then is, as the defendants were aware of the plaintiffs` concern that AE might close its accounts, that the defendants ought to have advised the plaintiffs that they could have applied for a Mareva injunction to prevent dissipation of AE`s assets if necessary, and that had such advice been given, the plaintiffs would have instructed the defendants not only to apply for a Mareva injunction but also to execute on the AS judgment as early as in November 1991.
The plaintiffs further allege that even then, and after they had instructed the defendants in late February 1992 to immediately garnish AS` bank accounts, the defendants did not do so. Instead they only obtained an order nisi on 2 March 1992 and a hearing date for the order absolute on 9 April 1992. This resulted in the order absolute application being adjourned indefinitely when it came on for hearing because by that time, a petition had already been filed by another creditor for AS to be wound up and indeed shortly thereafter in May 1992 AS was wound up.
So again, the plaintiffs say it was the defendants` failure to provide advice and the defendants` failure to act promptly that resulted in the plaintiffs` inability to recover the judgment sum of S$16,404.70 from AS.
 Summary of the plaintiffs` claim 
In summary therefore, the plaintiffs allege failure by the defendants to:
 
 
(i) properly advise on the AE cheque; 
 
(ii) commence proceedings against AE and AS promptly; 
 
(iii) prosecute those proceedings with diligence; 
 
(iv) draw up a proper affidavit with supporting documents in the summary judgment application against AE and which also resulted in a delay in the enforcement of the AS judgment; 
 
(v) advise the plaintiffs they could apply for a Mareva injunction on AE`s assets; and 
 
(vi) execute on the judgments against AE and AS promptly.
  
 
 
All of which resulted in unsuccessful recovery of the AE and the AS judgments.
 The defence 
A AE
 
 
(i) The AE cheque
  
 
 
The defendants deny any negligence. The second defendant, the partner having overall conduct of these claims and to whom Mr Lee principally turned for advice and to whom Mr Lee principally gave instructions, denied ever advising Mr Lee about the cheque sent by AE. The second defendant said the first time he knew of the cheque was on 4 November 1991. That was the date a copy of the cheque was received by him from the plaintiffs. He pointed out that this was well after the cheque itself had been returned to AE. He denied ever having discussed this cheque with Mr Lee or giving any advice on it.
(ii) Commencement and conduct of the claims
It was the second defendant`s evidence that the defendants were retained by the plaintiffs no earlier than 19 October 1991 and whilst he admitted Mr Lee had first spoken to him on that date about the claims and that he had as a precaution and in anticipation of being instructed to act, caused a search on AE to be made at the Companies Registry in Singapore, he said it was not until 22 October 1991 that Mr Lee sent to the defendants the plaintiffs` statement of account of the money owed to the plaintiffs by AE and instructed the defendants to proceed. Hence the commencement of the proceedings on 24 October 1991, followed by advice on 1 November 1991 by the second defendant to the plaintiffs - AE having entered appearance - that an application for summary judgment was appropriate coupled with a request that the plaintiffs send to the defendants copies of the relevant documentation evidencing AE`s debt. The second defendant said, following a reminder from him on 4 November 1991, the plaintiffs between 4 and 20 November 1991 sent copies of the relevant documentary evidence. This, the second defendant alleged, was the reason for the application for summary judgment being filed only on 20 November 1991.
As for the adjournment by the assistant registrar of the application for summary judgment in January 1992, the second defendant did not deny the affidavit he had filed lacked documentary proof but he was adamant that the affidavit he had prepared and filed in support of the application was not in any way defective and he asserted that his decision not to exhibit the necessary documentary evidence was reasonable. He pointed out that the rule had been very recently introduced, that he interpreted this as giving an applicant for summary judgment a choice as to how and when to exhibit such documentary proof (particularly as the documentary evidence was voluminous and would be costly to exhibit) and that if he was wrong in this view, which he said he was not and there was no reported authority that ran counter to his interpretation of this rule, then all he could justly be accused of was an error of judgment which by definition, was not negligence.
(iii) Execution
The second defendant did not deny he had advised the plaintiffs once they had got judgment that winding up AE was the appropriate course of action. He said that the first defendant only received instructions from the plaintiffs to garnish AE`s accounts on a date after 24 March 1992. He explained also that he was only able to extract the judgment on 24 March 1992 because it was not until 23 March 1992 that he was able to resolve a dispute he had with AE`s solicitors on the interest to be inserted in the judgment. So the negligence alleged by the plaintiffs was denied.
 B AS
The second defendant was equally adamant he only received instructions on or about 24 October 1991 to commence proceedings against AS and not before. He said having issued the writ on 24 October 1991 and having served it on 6 November 1991, he was able to obtain default judgment against AS on 19 November 1991 when AS failed to enter appearance. The second defendant alleged that the defendants did not execute because of specific instructions obtained from the plaintiffs not to do so until after judgment against AE had been obtained. He said he did not advise the plaintiffs to apply for a Mareva injunction because there was no evidence furnished by Mr Lee that AE would dissipate its assets by closing its bank accounts had the plaintiffs executed on the judgment they had obtained against AS. In any event, the second defendant asserted Mr Lee was sufficiently knowledgeable about enforcement of judgment procedures to have known what the plaintiffs could and could not do.
So the defendants denied the claims in their entirety and further submitted that:
 
 
(i) neither of the judgments was satisfied because of intervening events, viz the appointment of receivers of AE by other creditors and the winding-up of AS, matters over which they had no control; 
 
(ii) evidence of the recovery by the other creditor, First Hydraulics Pte Ltd, could not be relied upon as evidence of the defendants` failure because that creditor had obtained satisfaction by means other than executory processes; 
 
(iii) the judgments would in any event have been unsatisfied because the evidence showed that AE and AS had insufficient funds at the material time; 
 
(iv) even if there was such breach in respect of the summary judgment proceedings, the defendants claimed an immunity at law against actions in negligence as a tort or in contract.
  
 
 
And, the defendants counterclaimed for their fees of S$6,744.00 in acting for the plaintiffs in the AE and AS claims.
 The issues 
The following issues, therefore, arise:
 
 
(1) whether there was a duty owed in either contract or tort to the plaintiffs; 
 
(2) whether the defendants were in breach of that duty; and 
 
(3) whether that breach caused the loss suffered by the plaintiffs.
  
 
 
 
 
 Law 
 
 
 
The defendants owed a duty to the plaintiffs in both contract and tort not to be negligent. The duty implied at law in contract imports notions of reasonableness determined by the courts. The tortious duties which are owed are measured by the standard of the reasonable lawyer. In effect, there is little difference between implied contractual duties and tortious ones and it would seem then that it would not really matter how such obligations are characterized. However, as different rules of remoteness apply, which leads to some divergence in recovery between the two causes of action, it becomes necessary to examine the obligations separately. Since the tort test of remoteness is less stringent than the one in contract, I have given primary consideration to the cause of action in tort.
 A Duty in tort and contract
Separate contracts arose in respect of the actions against AE and AS. These contracts were oral and as no evidence as to specific terms governing the defendants` obligations was adduced, the relationship between the parties would be governed largely by implied terms recognized by law. There are various ways of categorizing those terms, but for the purposes of this case, they are considered under the general rubric of exercising due skill and care. In England, it is an implied term at law that the solicitor will exercise due skill and care in his work: see 
 Nocton v Lord Ashburton 
 
[1914] AC 932
.
In 
 Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett, Stubbs & Kemp 
 (a firm) 
 [1979] Ch 384, it was found that a general duty in tort could be owed by the solicitor to his client. The same obligation to a client was implicitly recognized to apply to a barrister in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
[1969] 1 AC 191
.
The parties chose to address their arguments without really distinguishing between liability in tort and in contract. It is clear that in the absence of express contractual stipulations, concurrent liabilities in both contract and tort can exist: see 
 Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd 
[1994] 3 WLR 761
 at p 786, where Lord Goff, with whom the other law lords concurred, approved the statement by Oliver J in 
 Midland Bank Trust Co v Hett, Stubbs & Kemp 
 that: 
 
A concurrent or alternative liability will not be admitted if its effect would be to permit the plaintiff to circumvent or escape a contractual exclusion or limitation of liability for the act or omission that would constitute the tort. Subject to this qualification, where concurrent liability in tort and contract exists the plaintiff has the right to assert the cause of action that appears to be most advantageous to him in respect of any particular legal consequence.
 
 
 
I understand GP Selvam J in 
Chuan Hup Marine Ltd v Sembawang Engineering Pte Ltd
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 629
  , in this context, shares the same view.
 B Immunity
However, though a duty may be found to exist, recovery may be precluded by an immunity arising out of considerations of public policy. Such an immunity has been recognized in England and in Singapore to exist.
In England, it is established that a barrister enjoys an immunity against actions in negligence in respect of matters concerning the conduct of a trial in court: 
 Rondel v Worsley 
 
[1969] 1 AC 191
.
 Rondel v Worsley 
 involved a plaintiff who had been charged with causing grievous bodily harm. He retained the services of a barrister on a dock brief. At the conclusion of the trial, the plaintiff was convicted, but being dissatisfied with the conduct of the defence by the defendant - he felt the defendant had failed to ask certain questions which would have established the plaintiff`s innocence - he sued the defendant, who sought to have the action struck out as not disclosing any reasonable cause of action.
The House of Lords found that the defendant as a barrister was entitled to an immunity under which he was protected from being sued for professional negligence in the conduct of a case, which immunity is based on public policy. Lord Reid said (at p 227): 
 
It is, I think, clear that the existing rule was based on considerations of public policy. But public policy is not immutable and doubts appear to have arisen in many quarters whether that rule is justifiable in present day conditions in this country. So it appears to me to be proper to re-examine the whole matter.
 
 
 
And continued: 
 
It has long been recognized that no counsel is entitled to refuse to act in a sphere in which he practises, and on being tendered a proper fee, for any person however unpopular or even offensive he or his opinions may be, and it is essential that that duty must continue: justice cannot be done and certainly cannot be seen to be done otherwise. If counsel is bound to act for such a person, no reasonable man could think the less of any counsel because of his association with such a client, but if counsel could pick and choose, his reputation might suffer if he chose to act for such a client, and the client might have great difficulty in obtaining proper legal assistance.
 
 
 
Every counsel has a duty to his client fearlessly to raise every issue, advance every argument, and ask every question, however distasteful, which he thinks will help his client`s case. But as an officer of the court concerned in the administration of justice, he has an overriding duty to the court, to the standards of his profession, and to the public, which may and often does lead to a conflict with his client`s wishes or with what the client thinks are his personal interests. Counsel must not mislead the court, he must not lend himself to casting aspersions on the other party or witnesses for which there is no sufficient basis in the information in his possession, he must not withhold authorities or documents which may tell against his clients but which the law or the standards of his profession require him to produce. By so acting he may well incur the displeasure or worse of his client so that if the case is lost, his client would or might seek legal redress if that were open to him.
And added (at p 228): 
 
And there is another factor which I fear might operate in a much greater number of cases. Every counsel in practice knows that daily he is faced with the question whether in his client`s interest, he should raise a new issue, put another witness in the box, or ask further questions of the witness whom he is examining or cross-examining. That is seldom an easy question but I think that most experienced counsel would agree that the golden rule is - when in doubt, stop. Far more cases have been lost by going on too long than by stopping too soon. But the client does not know that. To him brevity may indicate incompetence or negligence and sometimes stopping too soon is an error of judgment. So I think it not at all improbable that the possibility of being sued for negligence would at least subconsciously lead some counsel to undue prolixity, which would not only be harmful to the client but against the public interest in prolonging trials ... .
 
 
 
Further, at p 230, he said: 
 
Suppose that, as in the present case, a convicted man sues his counsel. To succeed he must show not only that his counsel was guilty of professional negligence but also that that negligence caused him loss. The loss would be that he was wrongly convicted by reason of his counsel`s negligence. So after the plaintiff`s appeal against conviction had been dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the whole case would in effect have to be retried in a civil court where the standard of proof is different.
 
 
 
Lord Morris added (at p 251): 
 
It would be a retrograde development if an advocate were under pressure unwarrantably to subordinate his duty to the court to his duty to the client.
 
 
 
Similar reasons were given by the other law lords in that case for the existence of the barrister`s immunity.
The next opportunity, it appears, when the House of Lords had occasion to discuss immunity was in 
 Saif Ali & Anor v Sidney Mitchell & Co (a firm) & Ors 
[1978] 3 WLR 849
, where the majority view was that on the facts in that case, immunity was not considered to apply. In arriving at that decision, the House reformulated the immunity. Lord Wilberforce, a member of the majority, was of the view that the operative public policy consideration was the need to ensure that matters previously tried would not be attacked and on that basis, the immunity established in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
 was extended to include pre-trial work which was intimately connected with the conduct of a case in court. He adopted the principle stated by McCarthy P in 
 Rees v Sinclair 
 [1974] 1 NZLR 180, at p 187, which is that: 
 
[T]he protection exists only where the particular work is so intimately connected with the conduct of the cause in court that it can fairly be said to be a preliminary decision affecting the way that cause is to be conducted when it comes to a hearing.
 
 
 
Lord Diplock, who was in the majority, was similarly of the view that regard had to be had to the underlying policy considerations, namely, the duty owed to the court, the need to protect participants in court proceedings from civil liability, and the avoidance of collateral attacks. He found that these considerations were not applicable in relation to out of court work.
Subsequently the English Court of Appeal considered the immunity claimed in 
 Somasundaram v M Julius Melchior (a firm) 
 
[1988] 1 WLR 1394
. It was noted in that case that public policy required that collateral attacks on decisions of competent courts could not be allowed. In the view of the Court of Appeal, this principle of public policy operated as an independent consideration, regardless of whether the immunity recognized in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
 in fact applies to a particular case.
Finally, the prohibition against collateral attacks, which is in fact an abuse of court process, has been most recently applied in 
 Smith v Linskills (a firm) & Anor 
 [1995] 3 All ER 226, in which Potter J dismissed a claim against the plaintiff`s solicitors for negligence in the conduct of the plaintiff`s defence.
In Singapore, the immunity laid down in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
has been accepted to apply. In 
 Majid v Muthuswamy 
 
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 89
 , an appeal to the Federal Court in Singapore, claims were made against a deceased solicitor in relation to three court proceedings. Two of the claims were considered by the court as not disclosing any cause of action since the solicitor was not acting for the claimant in them. As for the third, the court was of the view that no negligence was disclosed. It was in the context of considering how the matter would stand if that third claim had disclosed a cause of action, that the court had to consider whether 
 Rondel v Worsley 
applied locally.
Wee Chong Jin CJ, in delivering the judgment of the court, observed (at p 90): 
 
The case of 
 Rondel v Worsley
 decided in the House of Lords has held that on grounds of public policy, a barrister in England is not liable for negligence, so long as the negligence alleged, arises during his conduct of a case.
 
 
 
There are 
 dicta 
 in that House which indicate that the same considerations would apply so far as solicitors are concerned in England. Without finally deciding the question, we are at present inclined to the view that the same considerations of public policy apply in Singapore and that therefore the decision in 
 Rondel`s 
 case would apply in Singapore too.
The profession is a fused one here, and having regard to the reasons given by the Law Lords in 
 Rondel`s 
 case, which we would respectfully agree with, we think that the position in Singapore could be stated thus: an advocate and solicitor can be sued for professional negligence where the act complained of is an act done in his capacity of a solicitor but will not be liable for negligence if the act complained of is done in his capacity as an advocate. That broadly is our view at the present ... .
There are a number of points to note of this decision. Firstly, the court in 
 Majid v Muthuswamy 
 had regard to the policy considerations underlying the decision in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
. Secondly, although the court drew a distinction between an act 
 qua 
 solicitor and one 
 qua 
barrister, it did not address and did not purport to lay down a test to distinguish between what would be termed solicitor`s and what would be termed barrister`s work. Recognizing that, the court said it did not regard its decision as final. Thirdly, these observations, concerning the application of 
 Rondel v Worsley 
 were dicta.
In saying those comments were dicta, it is not suggested that 
 Rondel v Worsley 
does not apply. It certainly does where there can be no doubt where the work undertaken, the subject of the allegation of negligence, was clearly in the course of the conduct of a case in court affecting its outcome as in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
. The problem arises where the negligence or breach complained of was clearly not during the course of conducting a case in court, but arose out of work preparatory to the hearing or subsequent to judgment. In particular, is the preparation of a defective affidavit in breach of the rule for a summary judgment application by an advocate and solicitor, solicitor`s work or barrister`s work, or to adopt the test in 
 Rees v Sinclair 
, is that work so intimately connected to the conduct of a case in court so as to fall within the immunity? If it is so intimately connected, or if it is barrister`s work (and as to that I have my doubts) then it would follow that all affidavits prepared by advocates and solicitors in Singapore not complying with the rule or any other provisions of the Rules of the Supreme Court intimately connected to the conduct of a case in court would be protected by immunity. That could not have been the intention in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
or in 
 Majid v Muthuswamy 
 . Thus what I believe needs to be closely examined, in the local context where the law profession is fused, is the basis and the precise extent to which the immunity in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
 applies in Singapore, taking into account the various policy considerations stated in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
 and their applicability to Singapore.
Further, the reformulation in 
 Saif Ali v Sidney Mitchell 
of the 
 Rondel v Worsley 
 immunity can give rise to difficulties in Singapore because in characterizing whether the alleged act of negligence by an advocate and solicitor is intimately connected to the conduct of a case in court, there can really be no clear distinction between work intimately connected and that which is not. Indeed, it was this difficulty which led Lord Russel and Lord Keith in 
 Saif Ali 
 v Sydney Mitchell 
 to refuse to limit the immunity of a barrister in that way.
A surer guide then to determining the scope of the immunity is to examine the underlying public policies as identified by Lord Reid in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
. Lord Reid himself noted that considerations of public policies are not immutable, and ought to fit the times. Similarly, public policy ought to address local concerns. Policies pertinent in the context of the split profession in England would not necessarily be applicable in Singapore, and not just because the profession here is fused. Indeed, even in England, there is a discernible trend, as is apparent from 
 Saif Ali v Sidney Mitchell 
and 
 Somasundaram v Julius Melchior, 
 to clarify the scope of the immunity since the immunity must only go so far as to serve the interests of the community and not a step further, lest it becomes an unwarranted and unjustified privilege.
What then are the possible policy considerations in Singapore and which of these considerations would grant absolute immunity to the defendants in the circumstances of this case?
The possible policy considerations espoused in 
 Rondel 
are:
 
 
(1) the cab rank rule; 
 
(2) the duty owed to the court; 
 
(3) the independence of counsel; and 
 
(4) the 
 de facto 
 retrial of the original case giving rise to the allegation of negligence, which amounts to a collateral attack on the prior decision.
  
 
 
Of the four considerations, the independence of counsel and the duty owed to the court go to the question of whether a breach has occurred. They do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that a duty to exercise due care and skill ought not to operate, but rather that in certain circumstances what ought to be considered a breach is justified or excused by overriding considerations, so a distinction needs to be drawn between policy factors justifying or excusing breach, and those denying the existence of a duty to exercise due care and skill.
(i) Policy factors going to questions of breach With respect to the need to protect the independence of counsel, Lord Reid in 
 Rondel v Worsley 
noted the possibility that if the barrister (or in Singapore, an advocate and solicitor) had no immunity, he may feel compelled to exercise some form of `defensive` litigation, and thereby prolong the trial. The immunity thus serves to protect the independence as it were of the barrister. However, an appropriately formulated test of standard of care is a sufficient protection against that danger. In any event, the concern that doctors may resort to `defensive` medicine has never prevented a finding of liability in medical negligence.
It is clear that the need to protect that independence cannot go so far as to absolve counsel from liability for gross errors of judgment. It is far better for this question of independence to be weighed as a question of judgment only and to consider that this factor does not exist independently of the need to take due care in the exercise of judgment. As Lord Diplock said in 
 Saif Ali v Sydney Mitchell 
(at p 861), after considering the various duties owed to the court: 
 
The fact that application of the rules that a barrister must observe may in particular cases call for the exercise of finely balanced judgments upon matters about which different members of the profession might take different views, does not in my view provide sufficient reason for granting absolute immunity from liability at common law. No matter what profession it may be, the common law does not impose on those who practise it any liability for damage resulting from what in the result turns out to have been errors of judgment, unless the error was such as no reasonably well-informed and competent member of that profession could have made. So too the common law makes allowance for the difficulties in the circumstances in which professional judgments have to be made and acted upon.
 
 
 
That leaves the argument that liability would interfere with the duty owed to the court. But an act or an omission in fulfilment of that duty to the court could never amount to negligence simply because it would be in the fulfilment of a greater obligation which justifies that act or omission.
The two factors of independence of counsel and of the duty owed to the court could not for these reasons accurately be described as forming the basis for the immunity in Singapore. In any event, on the facts of this case, none of the alleged acts of negligence would have been justified or excused by these two factors.
(ii) Policy factors denying the existence of a duty
That leaves:
 
 
(1) the cab rank rule; and 
 
(2) prevention of collateral attacks.
  
 
 
Taking the first, viz the cab rank rule, which is the inability of a barrister to choose his clients, it is difficult to see how that could really be a material consideration in Singapore. The force of this consideration has been very much doubted even in England. In a fused profession, which is what we have in Singapore, the barrister`s inability to choose his clients is irrelevant.
The most cogent argument for the existence of the immunity is the second, viz that it is required to prevent collateral attacks, although the danger of such attacks can be overstated. A matter in a decided case is considered res judicata. Where the allegation of negligence in effect attacks the findings of the case or its verdict, it is an abuse of the process of court, and in effect amounts to a retrial of the issues. Guarding against such attack justifies the difference in the position between a lawyer and an accountant or a doctor. The need to ensure finality of litigation is of sufficient importance to outweigh instances of negligence, no matter how gross.
For these reasons, of all these policy considerations the consideration that appears most relevant to Singapore and having regard to the circumstances of this case is that of collateral attack. The 
 Rondel v Worsley 
immunity conferred on an advocate and solicitor in Singapore against claims for negligence should therefore only apply if, by not conferring immunity, attacks on prior decisions of the courts would follow. That should be the extent of the immunity in Singapore.
Limiting the immunity in this way will not result in excessive exposure of lawyers to negligence claims or subject them to incessant nuisance litigation. It has to be remembered that the standard of care adopted by the courts is not that of a particularly competent or skilful practitioner, but merely that of the reasonable one. The standard of care is objective and does not depend on the particular circumstances of the tortfeasor, though it is possible for him to hold out that the skill possessed is lower than that normally expected.
So, the degree of care and skill expected of the defendants in this case is that of reasonably competent and diligent solicitors and in circumstances where the defendants fall short of that degree of care and skill they should only be able to claim immunity to preclude attacks on a prior decision of the court.
A consequence of such skill is that there ought to be adequate knowledge of the law (
 Kitchen v Royal Air Forces Association 
[1958] 2 All ER 241). The lawyer `is liable for the consequences of ignorance or non-observance of the rules of practice` (
 Godefroy v Dalton 
 (1830) 6 Bing 460; 130 ER 1357). Similarly, a lawyer choosing to adopt a particular method when another is clearly right is also in breach of his duty (
 Levy v Spyers 
 (1856) 1 F & F 3; 175 ER 599). The obligation on the lawyer to have adequate knowledge however does not extend to errors of judgment in doubtful areas of the law (
 Godefroy v Dalton 
 ).
 Findings 
On that note, I now turn to the evidence adduced in this case and the findings I have made with regard to the evidence.
In summary, with the exception of the allegation of negligence or breach of contractual duty in respect of the affidavit prepared and filed by the defendants in support of the summary judgment application against AE, I am not satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the plaintiffs` loss arose in the circumstances alleged by them. Having carefully observed the demeanour of the witnesses and the manner in which the questions put to them was answered, I preferred the defendants` evidence to the plaintiffs. I will explain why.
(i) The AE cheque
Mr Lee in the course of the trial alleged that the cheque was received on 24 October 1991. Subsequently Mr Lee also said during his cross-examination, in answer to the defendants` contention that the cheque was in fact received earlier, the following: 
 
Q: Look at p 150, para 3. Would you like to say something on 16 October 1991?
 
 
 
 
A: This date I think Mr Muthu the previous lawyer drafted this letter whereby he referred the date from the cheque. 
 
Q: But you said earlier this letter was written based on information given by you. 
 
A: For the date stated I think I did instruct or give information to mention exactly the date 16 October 1991 whereby I received the cheque. 
 
Q: Can you now look at p 2 of the statement of claim para 5.1? Would you like to comment on the pleading that the cheque was received on or about 16 October? 
 
A: I think Mr Rai also presumed 16 October is the date I received the cheque because he refers to the cheque document dated 16 October 1991.
  
 
 
It was significant also that even in the plaintiffs` statement of claim, it was pleaded the cheque was received on 16 October 1991 contrary to Mr Lee`s evidence and whilst the statement of claim is not evidence of the matters stated in it, nevertheless, these inconsistencies make it difficult for me to find on a balance of probabilities when the cheque was in fact received, which in turn makes it difficult for me to accept that any advice was given by the second defendant as alleged by the plaintiffs.
In addition, it was also Mr Lee`s evidence that there were payment plans proposed by AE which Mr Lee on his own had rejected. The cheque tendered by AE was apparently in attempted performance of one of these plans, though it fell short both in terms of time and quantum. It would not have been surprising therefore if Mr Lee had rejected the cheque on his own.
Mr Lee further alleged the second defendant`s advice to him not to accept the cheque rested on the second defendant`s supposed assumption that acceptance could complicate the suit against AE, but as I am unable to accept Mr Lee`s evidence, I do not think a finding is necessary on this. In any event, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the defendants had such concerns in mind.
(ii) The commencement of proceedings
In 
 Allen v Sir Alfred McAlpine & Sons Ltd 
[1968] 2 QB 229
 it was held that there should be reasonable promptness in pursuing a cause of action. On the evidence I do not think the defendants were in breach in not commencing proceedings promptly against either AE or AS. The files were opened on 24 October, and writs were filed on the same date. Ms Ann Gan, the then secretary of the second defendant, said in answer to the following questions put to her in cross-examination: 
 
Q: Do you as a matter of practice write the date when the file is opened, on the file?
 
 
 
 
A: Yes, I do. 
 
Q: Did you look at your file on the Argos Engineering matter and check the date when the file was opened before you stated what you stated in para 3? 
 
A: I didn`t check. 
 
Q: Is it your habit to communicate to Tongel Yeo who I presume was your boss instructions you receive from your client? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is it your habit to do this immediately on receipt of these instructions? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
This evidence was followed a little unusually, by a physical examination in court by the plaintiffs` counsel of the defendants` files. The examination disclosed the files were all dated 24 October 1991. The plaintiffs having asked to examine the files raised no objections that these results amounted to hearsay. In these circumstances I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs have shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the instructions were received in early October 1991.
(iii) Delay in prosecution of the claim
The plaintiffs alleged that there was a delay in obtaining summary judgment against AE. The defendants reply that there was only a 14-day gap between the receipt of documents and the application for summary judgment, and that the time was necessary for them to check through those documents.
I accept that the documents were received on or after 6 November 1991. While a two-week period for checking through the documents would seem excessive, nonetheless, the time taken does not, in my view, amount to an act of negligence, that is, one that no reasonable lawyer would have taken. Except for the very most urgent applications, particularly interlocutory ones, a two-week period of inaction is not indicative of negligence. The defendants may have been dilatory, but they were not negligent.
The plaintiffs further contend that the defendants ought to have applied for default judgment in respect of the AE action after the defence was not filed when it was due. But as was pointed out by the defendants in their submissions, this was not pleaded. Though the general claim of negligence would encompass such an omission, there is a necessity, stipulated under the Rules of the Supreme Court (O 18 r 12), for the plaintiffs to plead adequately their claim, so that the defendants know what they have to meet. At no point, even in the course of the trial, was there any indication that this was part of the plaintiffs` claim. I do not see how in these circumstances, I could possibly make a finding on this.
As for the plaintiffs` claim that the defendants could have sought an earlier date for the hearing of the plaintiffs` application for summary judgment when it was filed and also for a date earlier than 16 March 1992 when it was adjourned by the assistant registrar for want of a proper affidavit, these allegations were not specifically pleaded and no evidence was adduced by the plaintiffs on these allegations. Moreover these allegations were not specifically put to the second defendant - all that was suggested to him was that he did not pursue the claim with diligence which he denied. He was never specifically asked whether he could have asked for an earlier date. I could not in these circumstances make any finding on these allegations.
(iv) The failure to attach supporting documents to the O 14 application
Order 14 r 2(8) requires that supporting documents be provided. The relevant provisions provide: 
 
2(1) An application under Rule 1 must be made by summons supported by an affidavit or affidavits.
 
 
 
 
... 
 
(2) (8) An affidavit or affidavits for the purpose of this Rule must contain all necessary evidence in support of or in opposition (as the case may be) to the claim, or a part of the claim, to which the application relates, and unless the Court otherwise directs, may contain statements of information or belief with the sources and grounds thereof.
  
 
 
The words of the rule are clear. It is mandatory that the necessary evidence in support of the claim is provided. The defendants have, amongst other things, contended that they did not have at the time of filing of the application, all the relevant documents. However, when the defendants applied for summary judgment, it must follow they must have had sufficient evidence with them to have formed the view that no defence was available. Documents evidencing this would then have been the necessary evidence. In any event, it is evident and clear that not providing any is grossly insufficient.
The second defendant contended that what he did or omitted to do, while not prudent, was not unreasonable. It was his view that: 
 
It was for the applicants` lawyers to decide what to include ... such evidence could have been included in the reply affidavit.
 
 
 
And `... costs needed to be saved.`
I do not, however, think such a stance is reasonable in the light of the clear words of the rule. It would only have been through ignoring those plain words that one could come to the conclusion that it was unnecessary to include evidence such as documents or that such documents could be included in subsequent affidavits.
In this regard, the defendants further alleged that one should measure the requisite standard by what other lawyers would have done at that time. No evidence was in fact adduced of this. But even if any was, it would have been open to me to find, though the entire legal community thought otherwise, that such a view was erroneous and clearly manifested lack of due skill and care (
 Edward Wong Finance Co Ltd v Johnson, Stokes and Master 
[1984] AC 296
). Numbers alone cannot be conclusive.
The reasonable lawyer on reading the relevant provisions could not have come to any other interpretation than that supporting documents had to be provided. In 
 Godefroy v Dalton 
, it was said by Tindal CJ of the skill required of a solicitor (at p 467): 
 
He is liable for the consequences of ignorance or non-observance of the rules of practice of this court; or the want of care in the preparation of the cause of trial; or of attendance thereon with his witnesses; and for the mismanagement of so much of the conduct of a cause as is usually and ordinarily allotted to his department of the profession.
 
 
 
Those words apply equally to an advocate and solicitor in Singapore.
An advocate and solicitor is expected to know the rules of practice; he is expected to know what is required of him procedurally; he is expected to know the proper interpretation of what can only be the essentials of his work. Of course, no lawyer would need to know the whole of the law (
 Montriou v Jefferys 
(1825) 2 Car & P 113; 172 ER 51), but the lawyer must need to know the basics of his trade, and the rules of court can only be regarded as such. Given that the rule is clear in its requirements, and the defendants were grossly in error by not providing any supporting evidence whatsoever, it could not be said that the defendants` error was only one of judgment. The second defendant was at the material time a partner in his firm, and had been in practice for about seven years and his `judgment call`, as he labelled it would have to be measured against the standard of a lawyer of similar experience (
 Nettleship v Weston 
 
[1971] 2 QB 691
).
By the time the application was made, four months had passed since the amended rules came into force. While mere novelty or unfamiliarity is no excuse for negligence, it may be said that a reasonable lawyer may commit an error of judgment in dealing with the unfamiliar, but in this case, in my view, the amendment was clear in its effect. Anyone reading the provision would have understood what the rule meant.
The only conclusion I can draw then is that the defendants were negligent as regards the summary judgment application action; they had committed a breach of the duty of care owed by a reasonable lawyer to his client.
In these circumstances, does the 
 Rondel v Worsley 
immunity apply? The summary judgment application was heard in chambers before a registrar. Proceedings before a registrar are sufficiently akin to a trial: a decision is reached after both parties are heard; it is an exercise of a judicial office. Applying the test I suggested earlier to determine whether immunity applies, the question is whether an allegation of negligence would amount to a collateral attack on the assistant registrar`s decision. I do not think it does, because on the subsequent rehearing the summary judgment application was allowed, a finding of negligence would not affect the judgment on the summary judgment application at all; the same result would have followed. The allegation of negligence does not purport to attack a prior decision of the court. No immunity therefore exists in respect of the summary judgment application.
(v) Execution of judgment
 AE 
Solicitors are under a duty to execute judgments promptly (
 Harrington v Binns 
 (1863) F & F 942; 176 ER 429). With regard to the enforcement of the judgment obtained against AE, I am unable to reach a conclusive finding of fact. The plaintiffs allege that instructions were given on or about the date of judgment, that is around 16 March 1992. The defendants for their part say that it was only received in late March 1992 and that that partly explains the date of execution of the judgment in the form of garnishment against AE`s accounts on 31 March 1992. It was also the defendants` evidence that there was some dispute on the interest element of the AE claim with AE`s solicitors about the judgment awarded which the plaintiffs did not challenge although the plaintiffs said that in respect of the dispute about interest, that that should not have prevented the extraction of the judgment. I accept, however, the defendants` evidence that to execute leaving the interest element at large would be unwise; I do not think that a reasonable lawyer would do so. I also accept, on the evidence, that the defendants were not negligent in not having secured an earlier date for the hearing. Mr Lee insists that he had spoken and given instructions to the second defendant on 16 March 1992. The second defendant on the other hand said he could not recall if there was any such conversation and denies knowing the desired mode of execution of judgment against AE before 16 March 1992.
However, notwithstanding the plaintiffs` allegations, Mr Lee himself had some doubts in cross-examination about the date, though in re-examination he said that on viewing a fax received on 16 March 1992, he was quite certain that he had indeed spoken to the second defendant on that date. Mr Lee was clearly uncertain and he attempted to redress this in his re-examination; I was not satisfied by his subsequent attempts in his re-examination to dispel the earlier hesistancy he had shown.
 AS 
With regard to the execution of judgment against AS, the defendants do not deny that no advice was given to the plaintiffs about the options available to the plaintiffs to protect the judgment pending the outcome of the action against AE.
The plaintiffs alleged that although they were concerned about protecting the recovery of the then prospective judgment against AE, the defendants did not advise what could be done, as they ought to have.
The lawyer has a duty to advise the client in contentious matters. In 
 Jacks v Bell 
(1828) 3 C & P 316; 172 ER 437, it was held that a solicitor would be liable for not advising that there was no cause of action. By analogy, the lawyer ought also to advise about the available alternatives. But he cannot be expected to list all alternatives however remote they may be. He must be expected to exercise some judgment in the selection of alternatives to present to his client. The standard is again that of a reasonable and diligent lawyer (
 Godefroy v Dalton 
).
As regards the issue whether the defendants ought to have advised the plaintiffs of the protective measures the plaintiffs could take on the AE claim, the evidence of Ms Lee Yueh Fang, an assistant solicitor employed by the first defendants is important. This is what she said in answer to questions put to her in cross-examination: 
 
Q: Did you give Larry Lee any advice on what he is afraid of viz that by garnishing Argos Steel`s account, this may cause Argos Engineering to close their account with their bank ?
 
 
 
 
A: Not in relation thereto, not that I can recall. 
 
... 
 
Q: Would you have told Tongel Yeo that Larry Lee is afraid of garnishing the Argos Steel account because he is afraid Argos Engineering may close its account with the bank? 
 
A: I can`t recall.
  
 
 
The assumption implicit in these questions, though it was never asked expressly, was that Mr Lee had indeed told Ms Lee Yueh Fang that he was afraid that AE may close its account. It was implied as well that there was evidence of dissipation. Counsel for the defendants did not object to these questions being put to her in cross-examination although in re-examination, Miss Lee clarified her earlier answers as follows: 
 
Q: Did Larry Lee at any time tell you that he had evidence that Argos Steel or Argos Engineering were dissipating or attempting to dissipate their assets?
 
 
 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
Notwithstanding Miss Lee`s clarification, however, it was conceded by the defendants in their written submissions that Mr Lee had indeed told Ms Lee Yueh Fang that he was afraid that AE would close its accounts if execution was levied against AS. It was submitted by the defendants that: 
 
On 8 January 1992, Mr Lee told Ms Lee about an account of Argos Steel at Hongkong & Shanghai Bank, but gave no further details. However, he instructed her not to make any application until after judgment had been obtained against Argos Engineering because he was afraid that it would cause Argos Engineering to close its bank account.
 
 
 
The question then is whether such fears, assuming they were expressed, required the defendants to advise the plaintiffs of the pre-judgment conservation measures they could have taken on the AE claim.
On this the defendants made a number of submissions, all of which, save one, I could not accept.
Firstly, the defendants submitted as Mr Lee knew about the effectiveness of various enforcement proceedings there was no duty on the defendants to advise him as to what could be done. I find it difficult to accept this submission because no advice whatsoever was given. It would have been different if some advice had indeed been given and that advice was rejected by the client. A lawyer is retained specifically for his specialist knowledge. Some lay persons may be reasonably or even well acquainted with the law, but precisely because a lawyer holds out his specialist skills, the duty he has to advise cannot be the lesser for knowledgeable clients.
The second submission by the defendants was that regardless of any action against AS, AE would have dissipated its assets anyway. Even if that were so, the point is that no advice at all was given which would have enabled the plaintiffs to proceed with the action against AS.
Thirdly, the defendants submitted that AS and AE were different commercial entities, and that AS had no control over AE. Even though the corporate veil had not been lifted the point still is whether, as a matter of commercial reality, related companies, which the second defendant conceded AS and AE to be, would remain unaware of action taken against any of them. The issue is not whether AS would have caused AE to remove its assets upon execution being levied against the former, but whether AE`s independent reaction would have been to do so. The defendants say Mr Lee in any event decided to proceed with execution of the AS judgment despite the fact that no judgment had still been obtained against AE. Mr Lee made that decision when he was told that AS would be wound up. But Mr Lee was in a desperate situation then, and any fears he had about AE must have been clearly outweighed by what he thought was the impending demise of AS.
What I do accept, however, is the defendants` submission that because there was, as conceded by Mr Lee, no evidence of any dissipation by AE, it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to show that the reasonable advocate and solicitor would have assuaged Mr Larry Lee`s fears. In some circumstances there may be a duty to assuage fears but as on the facts of this case there was no evidence at the material time of any dissipation or danger of dissipation beyond Mr Lee`s fears, I accept the defendants` submission that the reasonable advocate and solicitor would not have done anything more than what the defendants did here.
Although the evidence shows that the defendants had not considered and addressed the plaintiffs concerns as to what precautionary measures could be taken by the plaintiffs to protect the AS judgment, this omission is not, by itself, conclusive. In the process of sifting alternatives, some are rejected out of hand, others are subconsciously never even considered. Which must be considered and which is not even to be thought of is part of the art of the law. Unless the alternative not even considered was one which the reasonable lawyer would have had to consider, the defendants were not in breach. Interlocutory reliefs are a standard part of the lawyer`s trade and in some circumstances they are undoubtedly necessary. In others optional. In even others still, a waste of effort and resources. Where there are indications of possible dissipation of assets, the reasonable lawyer must no doubt immediately consider such measures. Where none is present, it may not come to his mind at all.
As for executing promptly on the AS judgment, I accept that instructions were given by Mr Lee to Ms Lee Yueh Fang, on or about 2 March 1992 and as a garnishee order nisi was obtained on the same day against AS` accounts, this must be considered prompt action. I also accept the evidence of Ms Lee Yueh Fang that she obtained the earliest date available for the hearing on the decree absolute.
There was one other submission by the plaintiffs in respect of the AS claim. This is that the delay in the proceedings against AE affected the proceedings against AS. However as the plaintiffs did not also specifically allege this in the amended statement of claim, I accept the defendants` submission that the plaintiffs ought not be allowed to proceed on this point.
As I have found that the defendants have been negligent in one respect, that is in filing a defective affidavit on the AE claim and that immunity does not apply, I turn next to consider what, if any, is the plaintiffs` loss and the amount.
 Loss 
(A) Causation
The next issue is whether the breach of duty by the defendants in not attaching the relevant supporting documents caused the loss suffered by the plaintiffs. The burden of proving causation is unsettled law. A number of cases show the uncertainty. In 
 The Paludina; Owners of Steamship Singleton Abbey v Owners of Steamship Paludina 
 
[1927] AC 16
, the House of Lords took the view that the onus lay on the plaintiffs that there was no intervening cause, while in 
 Philco Radio and Television Corp of Great Britain Ltd v J Spurling Ltd & Ors 
[1949] 2 All ER 882, the Court of Appeal held that it lay on the defendants to show that there was an intervening cause. Thus in a claim that there is no causation, the question may be either whether the defendant has to assert that the link was broken or whether the plaintiff has to show that the link was present. The view taken by the author of 
 McGregor on Damages 
 (15th Ed, 1988) is that the burden rests on the plaintiff, for he alleges the items of recovery. Burrows on 
 Remedies for Torts and Breach of Contract 
 (2nd Ed, 1994) however takes the view that plaintiffs are only concerned with showing a prima facie case; the allegation of break in causation comes after the proof of that case, and properly belongs to the defendant. Burrow`s analysis appears to regard lack of causation as a form of defence but it is not a defence, strictly speaking. It is a direct attack on the plaintiff`s case, for it indicates that the plaintiff`s case is defective in one of its elements. From this it must follow that it must be part of the plaintiff`s assertions that there is sufficient causation, and therefore the burden must lie on him.
Was the adjournment then of the hearing to another date by the court an intervening cause breaking the chain of causation between the breach by the defendants and the loss suffered? In contract, in 
 Stansbie v Troman 
[1948] 1 All ER 599, it was held that where the duty of the defendant included ensuring that a third party act did not occur, there was no break in causation where that very third party act occurred. That case involved a painter who was left in the plaintiff`s house alone. He did not secure the house when he left it for a while. A burglary was committed. The painter was held liable, notwithstanding that the burglary was another person`s act for he was negligent in not preventing such an occurrence. In 
 London Joint Stock Bank v Macmillan 
 
[1918] AC 777
, a customer of a bank failed to sign his cheque in such a way as to prevent fraud. Someone managed to alter the amount drawn, and withdrew a larger amount. It was held that the customer was liable for the increased amount as it was a breach of duty to the bank to ensure that his signing of the cheque did not facilitate fraud. In these cases, the acts of the third parties were wrongful. The same principle should apply to lawful acts 
 a fortiori 
. In tort the position is similar. A third party act will not break the chain of causation where it was within the scope of the tortfeasor`s duty to prevent (
 Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co 
[1970] AC 1004
). But if it were otherwise, lawful acts would have to be distinguished from unlawful ones. The former will only break causation where it can be shown that they would have occurred anyway whether or not the tortfeasor`s act had preceded them. It must also be shown that such acts were not likely to occur (
 The Oropesa; Lord & Anor v Pacific Steam Navigation Co Ltd 
[1943] 1 All ER 211).
In the AE claim, the defendants had a duty to exercise skill and care in the litigation. That skill and care must include avoiding unnecessary adjournments. The decision of the court to adjourn flowed directly from the breach in not providing the necessary documents. The court`s decision did not break the causation and the defendants remain liable.
The purported winding-up and actual receivership of AE were similarly matters which the defendants ought to have guarded against. The defendants` duty included one of executing judgments promptly (
 Harrington v Binns 
). That obligation must include ensuring that judgments are not frustrated because of delays. There was therefore no break in causation.
(B) Remoteness
If there was no break in causation, was the loss too remote? The test of remoteness in tort was laid down in 
 The Wagon Mound; Overseas Tankship (UK) v Morts Dock & Engineering Co 
 [1961] 1 All ER 404, which held that the defendant is liable for all damages reasonably foreseeable. It is only necessary that what was reasonably foreseeable had a possibility of occurring rather than a probability (
 The Wagon Mound (No 2); Overseas Tankship (UK) v Miller Steamship Co Pty Ltd 
 [1966] 2 All ER 709). After 4 November 1991 the defendants knew that there were a number of creditors owed money by AE. It was thus reasonably foreseeable that a delay would possibly cause the defendants to fail to recover for the plaintiffs.
Remoteness in contract is governed by the rule in 
 Hadley v Baxendale 
(1854) 9 Ex 341; 156 ER 145. In contract, the probability of the event occurring must have been reasonably contemplated by the parties (
 The Heron II; Koufos v C Czarnikow 
 [1967] 3 All ER 686). The degree of likelihood is higher than that in tort. What is reasonably contemplatable must be measured at the time of the making of the contract: 
 Hadley v Baxendale 
 . This gives rise to problems of characterisation (
 Parsons (H) Livestock Ltd v Uttley Ingham & Co Ltd 
[1978] QB 791
); to some extent what the answer is depends on what is asked. If it were asked whether the defendants contemplated that there may not be recovery because of a large number of creditors, the evidence is that the defendants eventually knew on 4 November 1991 that there were a number of creditors who were pursuing payment by AE. But this would not have been clear at the time of the formation of the contract in October 1991, that is when instructions were given. No evidence was given that at that time the defendants had such knowledge. On this characterization, the loss would have been too remote.
An alternative characterization is to ask whether the defendants had it in mind that if they were to suffer delay there would be no recovery of the debt. The answer to this is that it was a possibility but the loss was too remote because the degree of likelihood required is that of probability rather than merely possibility.
In principle therefore, although the latter characterization appears less artificial and the more appropriate, the result is the same. The loss in contract is too remote.
Damages, in my view, are, therefore, only recoverable in tort. The amount recoverable is that which would put the plaintiffs into the same position as if the breach had not occurred (
 Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co 
(1880) 5 App Cas 25
. On that basis, the amount is the value of the judgment against AE, which was $82,920.40 and interest would run on that at 6% pa, from the date of breach, ie the date the order absolute was adjourned sine die.
The defendants submitted it was not shown that at the time of enforcement supposing that there was no delay in the obtaining of judgment against AE, that there was sufficient to meet the plaintiffs` award in full. In this regard, the evidence concerning First Hydraulic is relevant, for in March 1992, they recovered about $99,000. The defendants argue that this is irrelevant as the money obtained by First Hydraulic was not the result of an executionary process. This is spurious; the judgment was satisfied. It follows that there was money available to AE. That money would have been available before March 1992, and, therefore, available to the plaintiffs had the defendants obtained judgment for them earlier.
 Counterclaim 
That brings me to the defendants` counterclaim.
The rule is that a solicitor cannot recover costs if he has been guilty of negligence (
 Stokes v Trumper 
 (1855) 2 K & J 232; 69 ER 766). It is necessary to show that the result obtained by the solicitor was fruitless and that such failure results solely from the negligence. On the facts, no benefit was obtained by the plaintiffs on the AE judgment. It is the enjoyment of the fruits of the judgment which must be regarded as the result sought by the plaintiffs. Thus in respect of the AE action, no costs can be recovered.
As no breach was found in respect of the AS action, the defendants would be entitled to their retainer for that action. In the event, the defendants are entitled to $1,644 and interest running at 6% from 24 September 1992.
 Conclusion 
I therefore give judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of S$82,920.40 together with interest thereon at 6% pa from the date damage arose from the breach, ie the date the order absolute was adjourned sine die, or 4 May 1992. The plaintiffs` claim for S$16,404.70 is dismissed and there will be judgment for the defendants in the sum of S$1,644 plus interest at 6% pa from 24 September 1992. The defendants` counterclaim for their fees in the sum of S$5,100 is dismissed.
 Costs 
On the first day of the hearing, the plaintiffs applied to amend their claim. I allowed the application and awarded the costs of amendment and consequential amendments to the defendants.
About an hour was further wasted as the plaintiffs did not have one of their witnesses ready. The plaintiffs had several allegations of negligence. Only one succeeded and this was for the larger claim. The defendants succeeded on part of their counterclaim, albeit for a relatively smaller amount. In the event, taking a broadbrush approach and taking into account all the above matters, I award the plaintiffs two-thirds costs, on the standard basis.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiff company is a trading company which had a fixed deposit account with the defendant bank in respect of which it executed a fixed deposit agreement and a memorandum of lien on fixed deposits.
It was not a very active company. Its director Mr Shy Shinn-Shiu, a Taiwanese, would come to Singapore from time to time, and it had one full-time employee, Doreen Ong Swee Lim (hereinafter referred as `Doreen Ong`). Between 6 March 1992 and 2 July 1992 the defendant issued four letters of credit in favour of a Singapore company Kaoru Kuroki Agencies (hereinafter referred to as `Kaoru`) for an aggregate sum of $490,000. By the letters, the defendant undertook to negotiate Kaoru`s drafts upon presentation with Kaoru`s signed commercial invoices and delivery orders. The four letters of credit were the last four of a series of 13 such credits for the benefit of Kaoru for goods to be supplied by Kaoru. The goods were to be supplied from Kaoru`s warehouse to the plaintiff`s warehouse and did not involve shipment or shipping documents.
The applications for the letters of credit submitted to the defendant by Doreen Ong bore the forged signatures of Mr Shy. Each of the letters stipulated that it must be presented for negotiation together with the 
(1) signed commercial invoice in five copies indicating this credit number and countersigned by Lee Feng Steel Pte Ltd; 
(2) delivery order in duplicate indicating this letter of credit number, made out to First Commercial Bank Singapore for account of applicant chopped and authentically countersigned by buyer acknowledging receipt of goods in good order and conditions (sic).
After the letters of credit were issued, they were presented for negotiation with the corresponding invoices and delivery orders through the International Bank of Singapore. Subsequently Doreen Ong executed four trust receipts on behalf of the plaintiff in favour of the defendant in connection with those four transactions.
Doreen Ong and her husband were charged with cheating the defendant with the 13 letters of credit. She pleaded guilty to five charges and admitted other charges of cheating the defendant`s manager by deceiving him in believing that Mr Shy`s signatures in the applications (including the applications for the letters of credit in these proceedings) were genuine when she knew them to be false.
The basis of the plaintiff`s claim is set out in the following paragraphs of the statement of claim: 
 
 
4 It was an implied term of the contract between the defendant as bankers and the plaintiff company as customers that the defendant would observe and/or exercise reasonable skill and care in and about negotiating and/or paying on the LCs. 
 
(6) Purporting to act on behalf of the plaintiffs and in breach of her authority, Doreen forged the signature of the authorised signatory, one Mr Shy Shinn-Shiu, on the application forms for the LCs and eight others, which were chronologically prior to the LCs, all in favour of Kaoru. In breach of the plaintiffs` mandate, the defendant issued the LCs. 
 
(10) The plaintiffs further aver that the defendant knew or ought to reasonably know that the signatures on the application forms for the LCs were forged. Notwithstanding the fact that the defendant had prior knowledge and/or notice of the said forgeries, the defendant issued the LCs pursuant thereto. 
 
(11) In the premises, the defendant had no authority to pay the corresponding bills of exchange drawn in respect of the LCs. 
 
(14) At a date or dates unknown to the plaintiffs until discovery and/or interrogatories the defendant negotiated and honoured the LCs in favour of Kaoru notwithstanding apparent irregularities and/or discrepancies in the accompanying documents, and in continuing to negotiate and honour the LCs without any proper enquiry, the defendants were negligent and in breach of their duty of care and terms of the contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants.
  
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
Failing to discover the irregularities and/or discrepancies on the invoices submitted by Kaoru which indicated the term as `Cash Payment` instead of the relevant `LC number` as required under the terms of the credit.
 
 
 
At the trial the plaintiff summarised its case as follows: 
 
 
(i) The discrepancy between the signature on the application forms and the specimen signature is so pronounced that ordinary visual inspection would be sufficient to see that they did not correspond. 
 
(ii) The terms of the letter of authority clearly and expressly excludes Doreen`s authority to sign any papers in connection with the application of LCs. 
 
(iii) At no time thereafter did the plaintiffs expressly or impliedly appoint Doreen as their agent for the purpose of applying for LCs. 
 
(iv) The plaintiffs had never ratified the acts of Doreen in respect of any application for LCs. 
 
(v) The plaintiffs had never acted in such a manner as to lead the defendants to believe that they had authorised Doreen to act on their behalf, and that the defendants were not led into such belief so to accept the application for the LCs as within the scope of such ostensible authority.
  
 
 
Essentially, there were two elements in the plaintiff`s claim, firstly, the forged applications for the letters of credit, and secondly, the alleged discrepant invoices accepted for negotiation.
The defendant admitted para 4 but denied paras 6, 10, 11 and 14 of the statement of claim. The defendant also pleaded that the plaintiff was estopped from saying that the signatures in the application forms were forged or that the invoices were irregular or discrepant.
Beyond denying liability towards the plaintiff`s claim, the defendant made a counterclaim for $5,816.22 and interest, being the amount still outstanding from the sums that the defendant had paid under the letters of credit after setting off the fixed deposit account. The plaintiff`s defence to the counterclaim was a reiteration that no payment was due under the letters of credit.
The only witness for the plaintiff was Mr Shy. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief Mr Shy said that his signatures on the applications were forged. Mr Shy did not allege that Doreen Ong had forged his signatures, and there was no evidence that she did that. She admitted in the criminal proceedings to cheating the bank with the forged applications, and not that she forged the applications. To this extent the plaintiff`s claim in para 6 of its statement of claim that she forged the application was not proved.
He also alleged that three of the four invoices tendered under the letters did not conform with the terms of the letters of credit in that they did not bear the credit numbers.
Mr Shy also referred to the trust receipts Doreen Ong executed. He said that she was not authorized to sign them. The plaintiff had issued a letter of authority to the defendant of 5 January 1991 that: 
 
We hereby authorised (sic) Miss Ong Swee Lim of NRIC No 1782901/G to sign all IMPORT & EXPORT DOCUMENTS on behalf of LEE FENG STEEL PTE LTD (except LETTER OF CREDIT APPLICATION) with immediate effect.
 
 
 
Doreen Ong`s signature was appended to the letter against a stamp indicating that she was a director of the plaintiff. Mr Shy contended that the four trust receipts did not come within the authority conferred because they related to local letters of credit which did not involve any goods being imported or exported and were not import and export documents.
Mr George Lin Tzuoo Yau was the first witness for the defendant. He is the assistant vice president and deputy general manager of the defendant. Original copies of the invoices relating to the four letters of credit were tendered in evidence through him. The defendant maintained separate files for each of the letters of credit issued, and those invoices were retrieved from those files.
Mr Lin disagreed with the suggestion that Doreen Ong was not authorised to sign the trust receipts. He said that the trust receipts come within the meaning of import documents in the letter of authority because that expression covers all documents connected with letters of credit, local as well as foreign, established to buy goods.
The second witness for the defendant was Miss Yvonne Chan Shu Yuan. She is a clerk in the defendant`s letters of credit opening and advising section. She had checked the applications for the second, third and fourth letters of credit in question after they were submitted by Doreen Ong. She checked the signatures of the applications against Mr Shy`s specimen signature and had found no apparent discrepancies or irregularities.
Miss Chan referred to the invoices with no credit numbers. She said that they may be proforma invoices, ie preliminary invoices submitted to show what the buyer intended to buy from the seller, which are tendered with applications for letters of credit.
The third witness for the defendant was another employee, Miss Yeo Kah Hwa. At the material times she was attached to the inward documentary bills section of the export bills department of the defendant and her duty was to check documents tendered for compliance with the terms of letters of credit. She explained that when a presenting bank forwards documents to an issuing bank for negotiation it will stamp its name and reference number on the documents and enclose a covering schedule. She checked the documents tendered in respect of the four letters of credit. The invoices bore the credit numbers and the word `Cash` and she accepted them to be in compliance wit the terms of the letters of credit. The invoices also carried the stamp of the presenting bank, the International Bank of Singapore and the bank`s reference numbers.
The last witness for the defendant was Mr Cheong Koh Kee. He was a clerk in the employ of the defendant and had checked the application for the first of the four letters of credit in question that was submitted by Doreen Ong. He followed the same procedure as Miss Yvonne Chan and found no discrepancy or irregularity.
These are the essential facts. The defendant had issued the letters of credit purportedly at the plaintiff`s request. The plaintiff did not apply for them. Both parties were victims of Doreen Ong`s dishonesty, and the plaintiff says that it cannot be accountable for credits it did not apply for.
The defence is a denial that the letters of credit were issued in breach of the plaintiff`s mandate. This appeared to be a difficult position to take after the forgery of the applications was established. The defendant relied on the Privy Council`s decision in 
 Gian Singh & Co Ltd v Banque de L`Indochine 
 
[1974] 1 WLR 1234
 where Lord Diplock held (at pp 1238-1239): 
 
The fact that a document presented by the beneficiary under a documentary credit, which otherwise conforms to the requirements of the credit, is in fact a forgery does not, of itself, prevent the issuing bank from recovering from its customer money paid under the credit. The duty of the issuing bank, which it may perform either by itself, or by its agent, the notifying bank, is to examine documents with reasonable care to ascertain that they appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit. The express provision to this effect in art 7 of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits does no more than re-state the duty of the bank at common law. In business transactions financed by documentary credits banks must be able to act promptly on presentation of the documents. In the ordinary case visual inspection of the actual documents presented is all that is called for. The bank is under no duty to take any further steps to investigate the genuineness of a signature which, on the face of it, purports to be the signature of the person named or described in the letter of credit.
 
 
 
Counsel for the defendant recognised that the forgery in 
 Gian Singh 
 related to a document presented under a letter of credit, and not to the application for a letter of credit, but submitted that in theory there should be no difference in the standard of care required of an issuing bank either in checking documents presented under a letter of credit and in checking the letter of credit application itself.
There is a significant difference. When a customer applies for and a bank issues a letter of credit, a contractual relationship is established. The contract will probably incorporate the terms of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP), which sets out the issuing bank`s duties including its duty in checking documents tendered under the letter of credit. In any event, there will be contractual terms, expressed or implied, on the bank`s duty of care. Where no application is made by the customer, no contract is formed, and there are no contractual terms to protect the bank against the consequences of being deceived.
However that was not the only defence pleaded. The defendant also contended that the plaintiff was estopped from saying that the applications were forged because the plaintiff had known or ought or is deemed to have known that (a) the defendant would carry out Doreen Ong`s instructions because she was the plaintiff`s servant or agent with apparent authority to deal with the defendant on the plaintiff`s behalf, (b) the defendant would carry out the instructions because she was left in charge of the business, (c) the defendant would act on the trust receipts signed by her, and (d) the defendant was induced into believing that the plaintiff had signed the applications.
Doreen Ong was the plaintiff`s sole employee. Mr Shy had brought her with him to the bank when he was there to apply for letters of credit. She was authorised to handle correspondence with the bank. By the letter of authority the plaintiff also gave her the appearance of being a director.
The applications did not purport to be signed by Doreen Ong. Her deceit was that she delivered the applications purported to be signed by Mr Shy when she knew that he did not sign them. No question arises over her authority to 
 sign 
 such applications. The only question is whether she had the authority, real or ostensible, to 
 deliver 
 them. How senior need an employee be to hand in applications for his or her employer? When Doreen Ong submitted those four forged applications there was no reason for the defendant to doubt her authority to do that. On the principle that a principal is liable for the fraud of his agent acting within the scope of his authority, whether the fraud is committed for the benefit of the principal or for the benefit of the agent, the plaintiff is liable for her actions.
This principle was first pronounced in 
 Barwick v English Joint Stock Bank 
 (1867) LR 2 Exch 259, where Willes J held (at p 265): 
 
[W]hether a principal is answerable for the act of his agent in the course of his master`s business, and for his master`s benefit, no sensible distinction can be drawn between the case of fraud and the case of any other wrong. The general rule is, that the master is answerable for every such wrong of the servant or agent as is committed in the course of the service and for the master`s benefit, though no express command or privity of the master be proved.
 
 
 
The phrase `and for the master`s benefit` left room for doubt whether the master was also liable when the servant acts for his own benefit. This was considered and resolved by the House of Lords in 
 Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co 
 [1912] AC 714, where Lord Macnaghten, in the leading judgment held (at p 731) that `a principal must be liable for the fraud of his agent committed in the course of his agent`s employment and not beyond the scope of his agency, whether the fraud be committed for the principal`s benefit or not.`
Though the principle in 
 Lloyd 
`scase overcome the defendant`s difficulty on the question of its mandate to open the letters of credit, the defendant must still show that it had discharged its duty of care when it approved the applications. The plaintiff had alleged the defendant knew, or is presumed to know of the forged signatures in the applications.
Whether the plaintiff knew or had reason to know of the forgeries is a question of fact. There is no evidence that the defendant issued the letters of credit with actual knowledge that the applications were forged.
The real question then is whether it had reason to know that. This relates to a bank`s duty of care in processing such applications. The plaintiff accepted that the applications did not have to be examined by a document examiner. What is the standard by which the processing is to be done? Should officers who check signatures undergo training? Are they to check with the naked eye? What margins for variation should they allow?
No evidence on these matters was adduced. Counsel highlighted differences in the signatures in the applications from the specimen signature. I can see the differences, but I am not able to say that they were such that a reasonable bank officer would have detected the forgery.
Having found that the defendant was entitled to receive and approve the applications, it is not necessary for me to deal with the other defences of estoppel.
The negligence and breach of contract referred to in para 14 of the statement of claim is particularised to as `Failing to discover the irregularities and/or discrepancies on the invoices submitted by Kaoru which indicated the term as `Cash Payment` instead of the relevant `LC number` as required under the terms of the credit.`
Counsel for the plaintiff conceded that if it was found that the invoices it relied on were proforma invoices delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant at the time of application, then there is no issue of non-compliance of the invoices with the terms of the letters of credit. Two versions of the invoices were tendered in evidence. First there was the set tendered by the plaintiff which was given by the defendant to Mr Shy when he went to the bank to inquire why the plaintiff was not able to make a withdrawal from its account. Three of the four invoices did not bear the corresponding credit numbers as required by the letters of credit, and all of them had the word `Cash` next to the printed word `Payment`. The defendant did not deny the existence of these invoices. It tendered in evidence another set of invoices which it said were forwarded to it by the presenting bank, International Bank of Singapore. Each of these invoices was kept in the file maintained for each application. However three copies of the invoice for the fourth application were found in the inward bills file. Mr Lin was not able to explain why the bank had four copies of this invoice because the procedure was for four of them to be sent to the customer. These invoices, unlike the photocopies which the plaintiff produced, bore the respective credit numbers and the stamp of the International Bank of Singapore which presented the documents for negotiation on behalf of Kaoru.
Miss Yvonne Chan offered an explanation for the copies of the invoices tendered by Mr Shy. She said that such invoices, which she called proforma invoices, may be tendered by applicants to show what they intended to buy but she could not remember if there were proforma invoices when she processed the applications for the second, third and fourth of the letters of credit in question. Mr Cheong corroborated Miss Chan`s evidence on the use of proforma invoices, and was also unable to remember if the application be processed was supported by a proforma invoice.37 Counsel for the plaintiff did not cross-examine them on the explanation offered.
After reviewing the evidence on the invoices I accept the explanation that invoices may be tendered in two forms and stages, first by the applicant and then by the presenting bank. The presence of International Bank of Singapore`s stamp on the invoices produced by the defendant points to these invoices being the ones presented by the bank which were checked during the negotiation of the drafts. Furthermore Miss Yeo Kah Hwa`s evidence that she checked the invoices bearing the credit numbers and the presenting bank`s stamps was not disputed during cross-examination.
The plaintiff`s unexplained retention of four copies of the invoices to the last letter of credit suggests that there was a departure from the practice of retaining only one copy. However the evidence remained that compliant invoices were tendered to the defendant for negotiation. Even if there was a departure from the practice of returning four copies of the invoices to the customer, that did not support the plaintiff`s claim that the invoices checked were irregular or discrepant.
In view of the foregoing findings, I dismiss the plaintiff`s claim. The defendant`s counterclaim succeeds and judgment shall be entered for the sum of $5,816.22 and interest at the contractual rate up to the date of judgment and at 6% pa under O 42 r 12, Rules of the Supreme Court thereafter until payment. The defendant will have the costs of the claim and the counterclaim, the latter to be in accordance with the Rules of the Subordinate Courts.

 The facts
The plaintiff, together with his wife, was the defendant in Suit No 803 of 1994 (the suit) in an action brought by J & V Development Pte Ltd (the claimant) for recovery of possession of a property situated at No 4 Lorong 33, Geylang, Singapore (the property).
On his part the plaintiff commenced proceedings against the claimant for adverse possession of the property in Originating Summons No 519 of 1994; the proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of the suit.
The claimant applied for and obtained summary judgment against the plaintiff in the suit on 21 October 1994 (the judgment) and the plaintiff`s appeal against the judgment was dismissed on 20 December 1994.
Sometime in late December 1994, the plaintiff through two representatives consulted the defendant law firm (which is a sole proprietorship) on the possibility of appealing against the judgment. Relying on the professional advice rendered to him, that he had a 40% chance of success, the plaintiff retained the services of the defendant and paid $20,000 to the defendant as a deposit to account of the costs and disbursements to be incurred for the appeal. The plaintiff agreed, on the defendant`s recommendation, to appoint another lawyer CYH as senior counsel for the appeal.
The defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal on 6 January 1995 followed by a notice of change of solicitors on 10 February 1995 to take over conduct of the matter from the plaintiff`s previous solicitors (the previous solicitors) after writing to the previous solicitors on 3 February 1995 and obtaining their reply thereto (on 9 February 1995), that they did not object to the defendant taking over conduct of the matter.
By his letter dated 21 January 1995 (the registrar`s letter), the Registrar of the Supreme Court notified the previous solicitors that the record of proceedings were ready for collection and that the record of appeal together with the plaintiff`s case (as appellant) must be filed within three months thereof namely, by 
 21 April 1995. 
By their letter dated 9 February 1995 to the defendant, the previous solicitors forwarded to the defendant the relevant documents for the suit together with a schedule for the documents; item 1 (repeated in item 2) of the schedule was the Registrar`s letter.
The defendant did not file the plaintiff`s case and record of appeal by 21 April 1995. He then received a letter dated 25 April 1995 from the Registrar of the Supreme Court advising that the plaintiff`s appeal was deemed to be withdrawn pursuant to O 57 r 9(4) of the Rules of the Supreme Court, as the time for filing the requisite documents had expired.
The defendant advised the plaintiff to apply for an extension of time to file the record of appeal and the plaintiff`s case. The plaintiff accordingly did so through his present solicitors, after discharging the defendant; his application was dismissed with costs on 19 May 1995.
The plaintiff then commenced these proceedings alleging the defendant had been negligent and had breached his duty of care to the plaintiff in, inter alia, failing/neglecting to file the plaintiff`s case and record of appeal by 21 April 1995. Resulting from the defendant`s negligence in allowing his appeal to lapse, the plaintiff alleged he had suffered the following loss and damage: 
(a) the plaintiff`s interest in the property which would not have been lost and or the chance of succeeding in his defence in the suit; 
(b) the sums of $65,709.68 as damages and $5,400 as costs paid to the claimant in the suit; 
(c) costs owed to the previous solicitors for defending the plaintiff in the suit; 
(d) $22,407.14 for costs and expenses incurred in applying unsuccessfully for extension of time to appeal to the Court of Appeal; 
(e) $20,000 paid to the defendant which consideration had wholly failed.
After the defendant had entered an appearance to the writ, the plaintiff applied for summary judgment (the application) for the sum of $20,000 and for interlocutory judgment with damages and interest, to be assessed.
The application was heard on 7 February 1995 whereupon the learned assistant registrar granted conditional leave to the defendant to defend provided he furnished a bankers` guarantee in the sum of $20,000 within 14 days failing which the plaintiff would be entitled to enter final judgment for that sum and interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed.
The plaintiff appealed against the orders made by the learned assistant registrar, on the ground that she should have awarded the plaintiff final judgment in the sum of $20,000 and interlocutory judgment. I heard the appeal whereupon I granted the plaintiff the orders prayed for in the application. The defendant has appealed against my decision. [Ed: The appeal has since been discontinued.]
 The appeal
 
 
 
 The defendant`s case
 
In resisting the application, the defendant filed an affidavit in which he deposed as follows: 
(a) he did not dispute that the elderly plaintiff (who like his wife is illiterate) consulted him through two representatives in December 1994. He had informed the representatives that he had not done and did not have the expertise to do, an appeal before the Court of Appeal; neither had he handled contentious adverse possession claims previously. The representatives asked and he recommended a senior lawyer (CYH) which suggestion they accepted; 
(b) he could not contact CYH until the first week of January 1995; he then forwarded the relevant papers to CYH. The defendant had made it clear to the plaintiff`s representatives that if CYH refused to accept the brief, he would decline to act for the plaintiff; 
(c) in late January 1995 CYH informed the defendant that the plaintiff`s likelihood of success for the appeal was 40% which view the defendant conveyed to the representatives and which advice was subsequently repeated by CYH at a meeting with the representatives. The plaintiff therefore relied on CYH`s advice not the defendant`s, in pursuing the appeal; 
(d) the representatives after obtaining the plaintiff`s instructions reverted to the defendant to confirm that the plaintiff wished to proceed with his appeal and wanted CYH to conduct the same. As CYH did not have the necessary support staff, it was agreed that the defendant would prepare the record of appeal and the plaintiff`s case; 
(e) after receiving the relevant papers from the previous solicitors, the defendant forwarded the same to CYH on 16 February 1995; he did not read the papers thoroughly upon receipt and he did not notice that the registrar`s letter was listed in the schedule for the documents; neither did the previous solicitors draw his attention to the same. He was also not told by the plaintiff`s representatives about the letter when he asked them for and they handed to him, all the relevant papers. He left the task of perusing the papers to CYH and waited to be directed by CYH on how to file the appeal papers; he also assumed that the trial judge had not completed writing the grounds of decision for the appeal.
The defendant contended that the plaintiff would not have succeeded in his appeal even if the record of appeal and the plaintiff`s case had been filed in time since he had failed at two lower courts; the odds against the plaintiff succeeding were 60%. In order to succeed against the defendant, the plaintiff would have to prove that he would have won in the Court of Appeal.
The defendant pointed out that by his own admission the plaintiff had not satisfied the test of adverse possession because: 
(a) in an undated statutory declaration the plaintiff had stated there was a letter from the alleged owner disputing his right to adverse possession during the relevant period; 
(b) in his defence to the suit, the plaintiff had stated that he shared the property with another person and it was only after her death in January 1988 that he occupied the whole of the property. Therefore the plaintiff had not fulfilled the 12 years` occupation required for adverse possession.
 (ii) The plaintiff`s case
Besides the plaintiff whose version of the facts I have already set out, an affidavit was also filed by one of his representatives (Angeline Tang) who consulted the defendant. Ms Tang confirmed the plaintiff`s version of the facts. She also confirmed that the defendant had told her he had no experience with Court of Appeal matters and would have to conduct the plaintiff`s appeal with a senior counsel such as CYH (whom the defendant had briefed several times previously) 
 but, at no time 
 did the defendant tell her that he did not want to take over the case nor was she told about the defendant`s arrangement with CYH vis a vis the conduct of the appeal.
Ms Tang further deposed that she had handed over to the defendant on 4 January 1995 at his request, the plaintiff`s file of documents which she was informed would be handed to CYH. Ms Tang pointed out that at that time the plaintiff did not have the registrar`s letter as it came later, it was unfair of the defendant to attempt to put the blame on her. Subsequently, together with the plaintiff, she met the defendant and CYH in early February 1995. Advice was given by both the defendant and CYH and their fees were also discussed. Later she attended the defendant`s office on the plaintiff`s instructions to pay the deposit and also to pay the judgment sum of $47,919.42 to the claimant. After that date she telephoned the defendant a few times to inquire about developments in the case and he told her the court had not yet given its reasons for rejecting the plaintiff`s appeal; the defendant assured her the matter was in good hands.
The plaintiff also filed a reply to the defendant`s affidavit. The plaintiff confirmed Ms Tang`s contention that at the meeting with the defendant and CYH, neither of them were told by the defendant that he would not be acting for or advising the plaintiff; they were also not told about any arrangement between the defendant and CYH for the conduct of the appeal, the plaintiff assumed they would do what was necessary. Fees were discussed and the plaintiff was advised that the defendant`s and CYH`s fees for the appeal were $10,000 and $25,000 respectively, which fees had to be paid before the two of them would act for him. The plaintiff denied that he relied solely on the advice of CYH - 
 both 
 the defendant and CYH advised him that he had a good claim for adverse possession for at least part of the property and the outhouse, the defendant advised him to pursue the appeal as he had 40% chance of success. Therefore the defendant was estopped from now asserting that the plaintiff would not succeed in his appeal.
The plaintiff proposed and later, handed to the defendant (through Ms Tang) 50% of the fees due to the defendant and CYH on the understanding that he would pay the balance on the day of the appeal. He also paid the judgment sum to the defendant for onforwarding to the claimant. Relying on the defendant`s advice, the plaintiff continued to remain in possession of the property pending the outcome of his appeal.
The plaintiff pointed out that the property had two buildings, namely, a main house and an outhouse. When he came across the property in 1978 both buildings were in a state of disrepair and looked abandoned. The plaintiff and his wife occupied the outhouse and he used about 10,000 sq ft of the land as a garage for his trade as a motor mechanic. At that time the main house was occupied by a lady who told him she was not the owner. He did not have the owner`s consent when he moved into the outhouse which he occupied exclusively, neither did he seek the owner`s consent when he moved in to the main house which he shared with the lady until her death in 1988.
 The appeal
 
 
 
 (i) The plaintiff`s case
 
Counsel for the plaintiff pointed out that the court below erred in refusing the plaintiff summary judgment when clearly the defendant was negligent. The necessary ingredients for actionable negligence against a solicitor are set out by the Court of Appeal in 
 Hilborne KE v Tan Tiang Quee 
[1972] 2 MLJ 94
 (at p 98); [1972-1974] SLR 85 (at p 94), these are: 
(a) a legal duty towards the client to exercise care or skill, or both; 
(b) a breach of that duty by the solicitor, ie a failure to attain the standard of care or skill prescribed by law; and 
(c) actual loss to the client as the direct result of such breach.
Clearly the plaintiff`s claim against the defendant satisfied the above ingredients. Once negligence is shown, the burden shifts to the defendant (see 
 Wai Wing Properties Pte Ltd v Lim, Ganesh & Liu 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 101
) to disprove the allegation.
The defendant as a solicitor ought to know the time frame for appeals. In 
 Miranda v Khoo Yew Boon 
[1968] 1 MLJ 161
 a Malaysian solicitor omitted to file a memorandum of appeal within the timeframe after filing a notice of appeal for his client and his application for an extension of time to do so was disallowed. The lawyer was held to be liable to his client for negligence. The court in 
 Wai Wing Properties Ltd 
 
 v Lim Ganesh & Liu 
 had referred to 
 Fletcher & Son v Jubb, Booth & Helliwell 
 [1920] 1 KB 168 where a solicitor was held to be guilty of negligence when he overlooked time and allowed his client`s claim to be time-barred under the Public Authorities Protection Act 1893. The Court of Appeal held that it was the duty of the solicitor to know the provisions of that Act.
The presence of a senior counsel does not exonerate a lawyer from the duties he owes to a client 
 (Mansouri v Bloomsbury Health Authority 
 (
 The Times, 
 20 July 20 1987);
 Mainz v James & Charles Dodd 
 (1978) 122 Sol Jo 645). It was not satisfactory even if a solicitor simply sent chasers once a month to counsel to get on with the preparation of the necessary advice (per Dillon LJ in 
 Mansouri 
`s case). The defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff to make sure the plaintiff`s appeal did not become nugatory.
The defendant had a duty to read the registrar`s letter as it was with him and he failed to explain why he did not; the defendant was negligent in not reading the letter - the defendant failed to keep track of the plaintiff`s appeal, he did absolutely nothing.
In so far as the plaintiff`s loss was concerned, it had been shown that he incurred the legal costs in his (unsuccessful) application for extension of time to file his record of appeal. Therefore the plaintiff should be awarded interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed.
 (ii) The defendant`s case
Counsel for the defendant argued that his client was 
 not 
 the party with whom the plaintiff contracted; the plaintiff looked to CYH for advice - the defendant was merely a conduit who sent everything to CYH. Throughout, the parties looked to CHY for guidance, the defendant did not render any advice at the meeting between the plaintiff and CYH. The defendant had made it clear to the plaintiff that he had not done an appeal to the Court of Appeal.
The plaintiff has to prove he suffered damages as a result of the failure to file the record of appeal in time. The plaintiff`s claim for adverse possession was not upheld in the courts below and on his own affidavit testimony, he had not been in exclusive occupation of the property for more than 12 years - he only said he occupied a substantial part thereof. Based on these two factors there are triable issues which warrant the case going to trial.
In reply to his opponent`s submissions, counsel for the plaintiff pointed out that CYH`s opinion was sought on the 
 likelihood 
 of success, which is different from the 
 conduct 
of the plaintiff`s appeal. As for the contention that the defendant was merely a conduit, his agreed fee for the appeal was $15,000, there must be a responsibility attendant to that fee. Further there was no letter from the defendant to the plaintiff to say that the former acted merely as a conduit. The plaintiff as a lay person did not know and was not told what role CYH and the defendant played. As the defendant had suffered loss by the legal costs he incurred, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove otherwise. Having initially informed the plaintiff his chances of success were 40% how can the defendant turn around to say his chances are zero?
 The decision
On the facts as adduced from the affidavits, and which were largely undisputed, I was of the view that the defendant had no valid defence to the plaintiff`s claim against him for professional negligence; indeed his conduct was inexcusable. I shall address the three main issues raised by the defendant which apparently found favour in the court below:
 Who was to conduct the plaintiff`s appeal?
I do not accept the defendant`s argument that he was merely to act as a conduit for CYH. The defendant was the solicitor 
 on record 
 for the appeal, after he filed a notice of change of solicitors on 6 January 1995, not CYH; how can his counsel say that the plaintiff did not contract with the defendant? Whatever private arrangement the defendant may have had with CYH was not made known to the plaintiff; neither did the defendant write to the plaintiff to confirm the limited role he intended to play in the appeal. Even so the defendant had admitted that he, not CYH, would prepare the record of appeal and the plaintiff`s case. Therefore, all the more reason he should have read the documents forwarded to him by the previous solicitors so as to monitor the deadline for filing the appeal documents. I do not accept the defendant`s excuse that he did not read thoroughly the letter dated 9 February 1995 from the previous solicitors, even a cursory glance would have sufficed as the registrar`s letter was listed as 
 items 1 and 2 
 in the schedule of documents. It is noteworthy that the defendant`s agreed fee for acting as a `conduit` was $15,000 which, with respect, is a very substantial sum to pay for such nominal services. It is equally noteworthy that CYH who the defendant described in his affidavit as, assuming
 a pivotal responsibility in the appeal 
 did not file 
 any 
 affidavit on the defendant`s behalf.
 Would the plaintiff have succeeded in his appeal if the defendant had filed the record of appeal in time?
It bears repeating that when the plaintiff met the defendant and CYH, the plaintiff and Ms Tang were told the chances of success were 40%; in the defendant`s affidavit the plaintiff`s chances were rated as nil - a drastic turnaround. The burden was on the defendant to explain why he had made a volte face in view of his and CYH`s earlier advice to the plaintiff and I was not satisfied he had discharged the burden. I would now refer to 
 Wai Wing Properties Pte Ltd v Lim Ganesh & Liu 
 cited by counsel.
The basis of the plaintiffs` action against the defendant law firm in that case is as follows. The plaintiffs were property developers who sold one unit each in their residential project to Lee and Neo in 1983. In 1985 the plaintiffs agreed to reduce the purchase price to Lee and Neo by $80,000 each which sum was to be applied to the last progress payment. Subsequently Lee and Neo executed sub-sales of their respective units. Lee sought confirmation that the price reduction applied to the sub-sales as well which confirmation was duly given by the plaintiffs.
After the plaintiffs had completed the project and the last instalment paid by the sub-purchasers, Lee and Neo asked the plaintiffs for the promised refund; the plaintiffs paid Lee $40,000 and Neo $38,400 but refused to pay the balance claiming the sub-sales disentitled them from the refund.
The plaintiffs then received two letters of demand from Lee and Neo under s 254(2) of the Companies Act for the balance sum outstanding. The plaintiffs` managing director Kwok consulted Liu of the defendants on the statutory demands; Liu advised that it would not be prudent of Lee and Neo to file a winding-up petition without first obtaining judgment against the plaintiffs, they did not have a clear case to obtain judgment and the refunds made to them were made under a mistake of fact or law. Liu further said he would write to the solicitors for Lee and Neo to explain the position; the letter was not written. Instead the plaintiffs were served with a winding-up petition by Lee which petition appeared in the press as well as in the government gazette. The plaintiffs` accounts with several banks were frozen. Liu was instructed by Kwok to apply to dismiss the winding-up petition. Liu then wrote a belated reply to Neo on the winding-up notice, Neo did not file a winding-up petition. Lee`s winding-up petition was withdrawn on the understanding he would commence proceedings for the recovery of his claim in the district courts which he did.
Eventually Liu discharged himself from further acting for the plaintiffs who then brought these proceedings against the law firm for professional negligence. Chao Hick Tin J found for the plaintiffs and on the issue of causation he said (at p 116): 
 
Liu has suggested in his evidence that even if a reply had been given there was no guarantee that Lee would not file his petition. In answer to that I would make these observations. Firstly, in civil litigation what needs to be shown is on a balance of probabilities, not certainty. Secondly, having been negligent in discharging his duties as a solicitor, which negligence I have found caused Lee to file the petition, I think the burden shifts to the defendants to show that even if there was no failure, Lee would still have proceeded to file the petition. Lee said he would act on the advice of his solicitors. Mr Kelvin Lim, the solicitor of Lee, was not called upon by the defence to testify. Thirdly, Liu himself said that there were merits in the plaintiffs` defence to the claim and that following the principles laid down in 
 Re Nima,
 a winding-up petition was not the proper procedure to recover a debt which was in dispute. What is there to suggest that Mr Kelvin Lim would not have been an equally competent and reasonable solicitor and see the point which Liu himself saw?
 
 
 
The argument here is similar to that advanced in 
 Heywood v Wellers 
 [1976] 1 AER 300 where the solicitors were alleged to have failed to take certain steps to protect the client. Denning MR rejected that argument as follows (at p 459): 
 
`It was suggested thateven if the solicitors had done their duty and taken the man to court he might still have molested her. But I do not think they can excuse themselves on that ground. After all, it was not put to the test and it was their fault that it was not put to the test. If they had taken him to court as she wished - and as they ought to have done - it might well have been effective to stop him from molesting her anymore. We should assume that it would have been effective to protect her, unless they prove that it would not.`
 
 
 
I fully endorse the above comments of Chao Hick Tin J and Denning MR. The burden is on the defendant, which he failed to discharge, to prove that the plaintiff would not have succeeded in his appeal in any event, even if the defendant had filed his record of appeal in time.
 Has the plaintiff proven he suffered loss as a result of the defendant`s negligence?
I found it difficult to comprehend the defendant`s contention that the plaintiff had not discharged the burden of proving his loss and damage when, the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to his solicitors as well as to the claimant`s solicitors arising from the defendant`s negligent conduct are well documented in the plaintiff`s affidavit. In any case the issue of the 
 extent 
 of the plaintiff`s loss would be dealt with later at the assessment stage, I was only concerned with liability. As for the deposit of $20,000, equally the defendant had no valid defence to the plaintiff`s claim for its refund as the consideration for the payment, 
 both 
 to the defendant and to CYH had wholly failed, the plaintiff`s appeal having been deemed to be withdrawn as a result of the defendant`s omission.
I could see no triable issues which warranted the matter going for trial. Accordingly I allowed the plaintiff`s appeal and granted him judgment in terms of his application.

This is an action for libel. The plaintiff, Chiam See Tong (Chiam), is an advocate and solicitor of over 20 years standing and was, until Parliament was prorogued ten days ago, a Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Potong Pasir where he was first elected in 1984. Chiam was elected under the banner of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP). The SDP is an opposition party.
The defendants are members of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the SDP, except that the 11th defendant`s defence was that he had resigned from the CEC on 30 October 1995. The first defendant, Ling How Doong (Ling), is the chairman of the SDP and was the MP for Bukit Gombak in the last Parliament. He is also an advocate and solicitor. The second defendant, Wong Hong Toy (Wong), is the vice-chairman and the third defendant, Chee Soon Juan (Chee), is the secretary-general. The seventh defendant, Cheo Chai Chen (Cheo), was the MP for Nee Soon Central. Chiam, Ling and Cheo together held three out of four opposition seats in the last Parliament.
On 6 November 1995, a press statement was issued by the CEC. It was signed by Wong for the CEC. There was no dispute that this press statement was extensively republished by the mass media in Singapore. It was broadcast by the Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) on its news broadcast and its InTV teletext service on the same day. On the next day, it was republished by the 
 Straits Times 
 which is the main English newspaper, the 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
 which is the main Chinese newspaper and the 
 Berita Harian 
 which is the only Malay newspaper in Singapore.
The text of the 6 November press statement is as follows: 
 
The SDP has asked Mr Chiam See Tong to resign from the Party. Mr Chiam has said that he would do so under one condition: that Dr Chee Soon Juan stands against him in a by-election in Potong Pasir. Dr Chee accepts the challenge under one condition: that Mr Chiam joins the PAP and stands as a PAP candidate. Of late, Mr Chiam has been highly praised by the PAP and he has also been very supportive of the ruling party in attacking the SDP. That being the case, he should join the PAP.
 
 
 
The SDP has shown tolerance and restraint in the face of Mr Chiam`s repeated attacks against the party. But Mr Chiam has mistaken kindness for weakness. As a matter of principle and honour, Mr Chiam must leave the party he disagrees with so much.
 
 
 
Mr Chiam almost killed the SDP when he abruptly and irresponsibly resigned as secretary-general. The CEC will not allow him to destroy the party again. Mr Chiam predicted that the collective leadership would not last. Today not only has this collective leadership lasted, but we have become stronger and has a firm sense of direction. Mr Chiam is now showing his spite and jealousy that the SDP has been able to progress without him.
 
 
 
The SDP is not about Chiam See Tong, Chee Soon Juan or any one individual; it is about a democratic party whose main interest is to serve the people of Singapore in the most effective manner. The SDP has made plain our manifesto and has worked extremely hard in the last two years to win the hearts and minds of Singaporeans. Our track record is a matter of public record and we are willing to let Singaporeans judge us for what we are and what we have done.
 
 
 
If Mr Chiam wishes to lead the SDP again, he is welcome to do so. But first he must set out his vision and programme for the party and let the party members decide if they want him as their leader. Up until now, all he has shown is a craze for personal political power. This is not what we, as a collective leadership, want for the SDP or for Singapore. We will remain disciplined and concentrate on fighting for the people`s rights and interests.
 
 
 
Once more, we call on Mr Chiam to join the PAP and to stand as a PAP candidate and we will contest him in Potong Pasir in a by-election.

Dated 6 November 1995
 
 
 
The letters `PAP` in the press statement refer to the People`s Action Party, the ruling party in Singapore.
Chiam alleged that the 6 November press statement is defamatory of him. The defence of the second, third, fifth to tenth and twelfth defendants was that the statement is not defamatory and in any event, they relied on fair comment. The first, fourth and eleventh defendants denied having anything to do with the 6 November press statement in their pleaded defences.
 The background
It is the case for Chiam that because the CEC had in the 6 November press statement referred to events that occurred in the SDP going back to 1993 he had to give evidence of the history of the SDP. The SDP was founded in 1980 and Chiam was one of its founding members. He was its secretary-general from 13 September 1980 till 17 May 1993, for over 12 years. In his evidence, Chiam said that he drafted the party`s constitution and its manifesto. Chee did not deny that Chiam had a hand in the drafting of the SDP`s constitution and its manifesto but said that he did not know whether other persons had helped Chiam.
Sometime in 1988, Wong, who had just resigned from the Workers` Party of which he was chairman, joined the SDP. According to Wong, he was approached by Chiam to do so. Chiam sought to deny that he brought Wong into the SDP, but admitted that he met with Wong to negotiate the terms under which the latter would join the SDP. At that time, Chiam already knew about Wong`s previous convictions.
In the early part of 1993, Chee`s employment with the National University of Singapore was terminated on account of his alleged misapplication of $200 of research funds. At that time Chee was already a CEC member and was the assistant secretary-general of the SDP. There was an occasion when Chiam defended Chee in Parliament.
In April of that year Chee went on a hunger strike. Chee`s evidence was that he took full responsibility for the hunger strike. Chiam in a press statement on 5 April said that he and the SDP had `full confidence` in Chee`s action and that `The SDP sympathises and respects the deep conviction and belief of Dr Chee in his present course of action`. Chiam`s evidence was that he tried to dissuade Chee from it. He, however, did not deny that he had suggested to Chee that if he were to go on a hunger strike, he should do so in a public place, namely at a block of flats in Potong Pasir.
Chiam then became concerned as to what the hunger strike would do to the image of SDP. On 17 May, Chiam attempted to table a motion in the CEC to censure Chee for the hunger strike. He was unanimously outvoted by the CEC and the motion was not allowed to be put. Chiam took this as a vote of no confidence against him. There and then he wrote out his resignation as the secretary-general of the SDP, stating that it was to be `forthwith` and walked out of the meeting.
Chee in his evidence said that he, together with some other members of the CEC went after Chiam to persuade him to return. Chiam`s testimony was that he did not remember this. However, it was not disputed that the CEC did subsequently send delegations to make overtures to Chiam to persuade him to remain as the party`s secretary-general, but the number of such meetings and the composition of the delegations, in particular whether Chee was one of the members, was in dispute.
In any event, Chiam laid down certain conditions for him to withdraw his resignation, in particular that Wong must resign from the CEC. This condition was not acceptable to the CEC because they felt that it was not for any individual to dictate who should or should not be in the CEC which is an elected body. In the meantime neither side announced Chiam`s resignation and the parties appeared to have carried on negotiations.
In June Chee met Chiam in the latter`s office. Chiam said that he had told Chee that the permit for the party`s newspaper, the Demokrat, had to be renewed, and that he could not sign the relevant forms as the SDP`s secretary-general as he had resigned on 17 May. Chiam said that he gave Chee till the end of June to reply. Chee did not dispute that there was a discussion about the permit. He, however, maintained that he went to see Chiam not on that subject but to persuade him to withdraw his resignation.
On 18 June, the CEC made a press release announcing that Chiam had `stepped down` as secretary-general of the SDP. Apparently, the CEC had given Chiam until 4pm that day to retract his resignation. Chiam claimed that Chee, who had been delegated the task of informing him of the deadline, had failed to do so and had subsequently admitted to the omission. Chee denied this, but could give no clear evidence on this point.
Chiam also said that he was not shown a copy of the press statement before it was released to the press and that he had to read it under the lights of a street lamp when shown a copy by a reporter. Wong`s evidence was that he and Ashleigh Seow, who was at that time a member of the CEC, had faxed a copy of the press statement to Chiam`s office.
Regardless of what had really happened, Chiam formed the impression that the press statement read like his political `epitaph`. He also took the view, though it was he who had tendered his resignation, that the press statement was a `fait accompli`. Chiam told the reporters, and this was published the next day, that he had not `stepped down` but had resigned over differences with the CEC. Later, in early July, Chiam said to the media that Chee had `usurped` his position as secretary-general of the SDP. Chee claimed that, as the assistant secretary-general, he had only stepped into Chiam`s shoes under the provisions of the SDP constitution.
On 16 July, Chiam gave a talk to the Singapore Press Club, which was followed by a question and answer session. Chiam was reported to have said, and he admitted saying, that `the opposition needed members who were credible, clean and trustworthy`, that Wong `had a criminal past` and Chee was `sacked over $200`. He had also asked rhetorically, `Why should people join a party where a leader goes on a hunger strike and does foolish things like that or you have a vice-chairman who has been jailed ... Who wants to join his party?`
Chiam`s stand in the witness box was that he had merely `criticised` the CEC. The CEC evidently thought otherwise, for they commenced disciplinary proceedings against Chiam. On 6 August, Chiam appeared before a disciplinary committee comprised of the CEC members which eventually decided to expel him from the SDP. This was followed by meetings between members of the CEC and Chiam to see whether a compromise could be reached by Chiam withdrawing what he said at the Press Club. It suffices to say that these came to nought and the minutes of the CEC meeting on 16 August recorded that the CEC had come to the conclusion that `further overtures would be fruitless` and that the expulsion should take effect from 20 August.
On 20 August, Chee wrote a letter to Chiam telling him that he had been expelled `forthwith` but that he could appeal to the SDP`s ordinary party conference. On the same day, Chee wrote to the Speaker of Parliament informing him that Chiam had been expelled. A press statement was also issued that day by the CEC to that effect.
The next day, Chiam wrote to the Speaker saying that his expulsion was invalid. At about the same time, some cadre supporters of Chiam twice requisitioned for an ordinary party conference in accordance with the SDP`s constitution. The first requisition was rejected by the CEC purportedly on the ground that some of the signatures were dubious. None of the defendants could explain why the second requisition was ignored.
Be that as it may, Chiam sought and obtained a declaration in the High Court from Warren LH Khoo J on 10 December 1993 that the expulsion was invalid. The learned judge found that Chiam had not been fairly heard. Chiam also obtained an injunction restraining the SDP from taking any steps to expel him. However, Khoo J rejected his allegation of bad faith or bias on the part of the CEC.
Thereafter, it would appear that there was an uneasy calm between the parties. There was no direct communication between Chiam and the CEC and they spoke to each other through the press. Chiam`s evidence was that he and the CEC were not on speaking terms. Chiam said that he refused to speak to them. Wong and Chee`s evidence was otherwise. Both of them said they had even invited him to go with them on a trip to Australia. Chiam`s evidence on this was equivocal.
In January of 1995, the SDP held its biennial open party conference. Chee was elected as the party`s secretary-general. Chiam declined to run for the post, claiming that the defendants had `packed` the party membership with `their own men`.
In May 1995, a motion was moved in Parliament by nominated MP Kanwaljit Soin (1) to ask the government to explain its refusal to stay Flor Contemplacion`s execution and (2) to reaffirm Parliament`s confidence in Singapore`s criminal justice system. Before this, the SDP had made a press statement on 23 March on this subject, and on 10 April Ling had written a letter to President Ramos of the Philippines in his capacity as Chairman of the SDP and `Unofficial Opposition Leader`.
At the end of the debate Chiam voted for the motion but Cheo abstained and Ling was not present when the vote was taken. Ling, Wong and Chee in the witness box did not take issue with the way Chiam voted, but they testified that they were of the view that Chiam`s speech, in the context of the speeches made, was an oblique attack by Chiam on the SDP. Whatever may be the case, it appeared that no action was taken by the CEC on that occasion.
 The immediate facts
In September, the Prime Minister of Singapore was invited to Williams College in Massachusetts, USA, where an honorary degree was conferred on him by the Prime Minister`s alma mater. Some faculty members of Williams College opposed the conferment of the degree and held an `alternative panel` discussion at Williams College to state their opposition. Chee was invited by the organisers of the alternative panel to attend the discussion, which he accepted. He went there with Wong and another member of the SDP.
At the alternative panel discussion, speeches were made by various persons, including Francis Seow (Seow) and Christopher Lingle. There was no dispute that in his speech Seow had made a baseless attack on the independence and integrity of the Singapore judiciary. Chee made two speeches. His first speech was a short response to the speech of Seow. Amongst other things, Chee said: 
 
I`ve heard a lot of comments and questions about Singapore and Singapore`s government this evening and I must say that I do agree very much with many things that Mr Seow and Dr Lingle have said and that even as we speak, me and my colleagues that are here this evening are going through some of these difficulties.
 
 
 
Because it was thought that Chee had, in his speech, endorsed the attack by Seow on the judiciary of Singapore, there was a debate in Parliament which I shall refer to as `the Williams College debate`. On 2 November, a motion was tabled in Parliament by a PAP MP, Dr Ow Chin Hock which (1) regrets Chee`s attendance at the alternative panel and his endorsement of Seow`s attacks, and (2) `deplores the SDP`s support for a baseless attack by a fugitive from justice on the independence and integrity` of Singapore`s judiciary and legal system. The CEC was of the view that this was a censure of the SDP. Chiam testified that he thought otherwise.
Both parties in these proceedings have referred extensively to Hansard for what happened during the Williams College debate on the motion. Chiam in his rather lengthy speech, amongst other things, referred to the SDP being run by `a megalomaniac`, made an oblique reference to the CEC as being `completely dishonest`, and said that Chee was a man who, `Whatever he can get, he gets, whether it is $100 or $200`. Chiam also said that by voting for the motion, he was `not running down the SDP` but was only against `those who are now in charge of the SDP`. At the conclusion of the debate the next day, the PAP members and Chiam voted for the motion. Ling and Cheo voted against the motion, because they took the stand that the SDP did not endorse or support Seow`s speech. The other opposition MP, Low Thia Khiang of the Workers` Party, abstained.
In court, it was put to Chiam that it was not necessary for him to have said what he did in Parliament and for him to have voted for the motion. Chiam maintained that he felt that it was necessary as this was a national issue and he is a loyal Singaporean. He admitted, however, that he decided to `air his views` about Chee.
The CEC took strong exception to Chiam`s speech and for the way he voted. The next day, they issued a press statement signed by Wong on behalf of the CEC. The defendants` evidence was that it was drafted by Chee with `input` from other CEC members.
In order to understand the state of affairs that existed between Chiam and the CEC, it is necessary to set out in full the press statement of 4 November 1995: 
 
The CEC notes with regret Mr Chiam See Tong`s remarks in Parliament. Mr Chiam did not point out how the SDP endorsed Mr Seow`s attacks on the judiciary. Instead, he launched a personal attack on the party leadership and Dr Chee Soon Juan.
 
 
 
In the past, the SDP has shown restraint in attacking Mr Chiam because it was still willing to work out a compromise with him. But in the past year, Mr Chiam has repeatedly attacked the SDP even while he continued to use the party`s name to hang on to his MP`s position. On several occasions in the recent past, Mr Chiam has not taken issue with many of the PAP`s policies but has used these occasions to help the PAP attack his own party. The last straw came when Mr Chiam, together with the PAP, attacked the SDP in Parliament yesterday.
 
 
 
Mr Chiam when he was secretary-general: 
[middot] made CEC members sign a deed not to criticise the party and its leadership when they left office. But he has repeatedly broken this solemn oath that he swore after he resigned as secretary-general, 
[middot] failed to honour his MP`s pledge of $500 a month, 
[middot] never set a vision or a platform for the SDP, 
[middot] hardly did any research to counter the PAP`s propaganda, 
[middot] declined to participate in the Cost Review Committee, 
[middot] did not coordinate with the SDP MPs in Parliament and 
[middot] neglected the party`s newspaper.
 
 
 
Under his leadership, the SDP was just a collection of individuals who did not have a common direction. In public, Mr Chiam espoused democratic practices. Within the party, however, Mr Chiam was an authoritarian. Since Mr Chiam`s departure as secretary-general, the SDP has become more purposeful. We have been willing to point out and engage the PAP`s propaganda. But after not getting his way within the Party Mr Chiam now joins in the PAP chorus to attack the SDP.
 
 
 
If Mr Chiam feels so strongly against the present leadership and its policies, then he must be principled enough to resign as an SDP member and join another party. But instead, he has chosen to hang as an SDP MP but not perform his role as part of the opposition in Parliament in accordance with the SDP`s policies. Mr Chiam knows that there is a court injunction `restraining the SDP whether by themselves or agents from expelling the plaintiff from the SDP or taking any steps to do so.` Since the SDP cannot take action against Mr Chiam in this regard, he should be decent enough to resign from a party he has denounced. Mr Chiam talked about human decency and honour. If he claims to be so decent, then why doesn`t he resign from a party he obviously dislikes so much? Any honourable politician would do that.
 
 
 
Residents of Potong Pasir voted for an SDP candidate and now find that their SDP MP supports the PAP to try to wreck his own party. The SDP calls on Mr Chiam See Tong to declare his real interests and intentions and to resign from the SDP.
 
 
 
Central Executive Committee
 
 
 
Dated 4 November 1995
 
 
 
That same day, Chiam responded to the CEC`s 4 November press statement by issuing his own press statement. The contents of this was substantially republished by the Sunday Times on 5 November. He threw a challenge to the leaders of the SDP, in particular he called on Chee to stand against him in a by-election in Potong Pasir with conditions attached which Mr Elias described as `Winner takes all`. It appears from his press statement that Chiam also entertained the pious hope that the Prime Minister would agree to hold a by-election in the constituency to help resolve the internal squabbles of the SDP. Again, to appreciate the turn of events, I set out this press statement in full: 
 
I shall come straight to the point. The CEC of the SDP wants me to resign from the party which I have founded. From the first day I took part in opposition politics I have announced that the type of opposition I intend to build must be constructive honest and sincere and I have not deviated from that intention. I founded the SDP so that it could be a vehicle for nation building and that is what I still want the SDP to do. On the other hand, the present CEC wants to use the SDP on an agenda which I do not agree. As long as I am in politics I shall not allow them to do so. They want me out of their way. They want me to resign from the party. The present CEC wants people to hear only their brand of politics. They do not want competition, they do not want an alternative voice within the SDP. Whilst preaching to the people of Singapore that there must be open debate yet the current SDP leadership does not want to debate with the alternative voice which I represent with the party. Is that the type of openness, is that the type of democracy which they proclaim to uphold?
 
 
 
I am saddened by the way the SDP is run and the present SDP CEC knows that I have a greater moral claim to the leadership than anyone of them, either individually or as a group, collectively. I tell the present collective leadership I want the leadership of the party back. On their part they want me out of the party. I want the people of Singapore to decide. The SDP has the largest number of Members of Parliament in Parliament. It is the most influential opposition party in Singapore. Whatever happens to the leadership or the direction taken by the SDP the effect of which must concern Singaporeans. To me the question of the leadership of the party must not be decided by the current CEC. The current CEC has been condemned by Parliament which represents the majority of the people of Singapore and as a result the current SDP CEC has no more moral authority to decide on the leadership of the SDP. To me, the people of Singapore must decide on who they want to lead the SDP. Therefore, I want the people of Singapore to decide on the choice of their leaders in the SDP. Accordingly, I am taking up the challenge of the current CEC of the SDP. I shall resign from the SDP. The terms and conditions for me to do so are as follows:
 
 
 
 
1 When I resign from the SDP I shall also automatically lose my Parliamentary seat in Potong Pasir. I want the present secretary-general, Chee Soon Juan to stand against me in Potong Pasir. Should Chee wins, he shall remain the leader of the SDP, and the current CEC remains intact, but should he loses then the whole current CEC and all the cadres shall immediately resign their posts as CEC and cadre members and I shall resume the secretary-general post and I shall pick my own CEC members which in turn shall select a whole new set of cadre members. 
 
2 The above suggestion is, of course, conditional to a by-election being held at Potong Pasir. If the current CEC agrees to my proposal then I undertake to write to the Prime Minister to hold a by-election in Potong Pasir upon my resignation from the SDP. 
 
3 The decision to resign from the SDP and to contest the consequent by-election at Potong Pasir is not lightly taken by me. To me politics is not about individual interests. To me politics is about national interest. The step I am taking now is for the good of Singapore and I call upon the people of Singapore to support me in my this momentous decision to resign from the party which I have been associated with the past 15 years.
  
 
 
The defendants` evidence of their reaction to this press statement was that nine members of the CEC, that is, excluding Ling, the fourth defendant and the eleventh defendant, met at a coffee shop around 12 noon on 6 November to discuss Chiam`s press statement. The result of the meeting was that the press statement of 6 November, the subject matter of this action, was issued. It was drafted by Chee, again with input from other CEC members. It was maintained by Wong and Chee that their press statement was a counter challenge to that of Chiam. The following question and answer of Wong explains the stand of the CEC: 
 
 
Q: Are you suggesting that the plaintiff should actually join the PAP? 
 
A: No. Plaintiff challenged the CEC that if he was to resign from the SDP, Dr Chee will have to stand for election at Potong Pasir against him. Plaintiff said if Dr Chee failed the CEC members must resign and so must the cadre members which means the entire CEC and cadre members will have to resign. It will mean that the entire party will no longer be in existence. Therefore, it was an unreasonable condition which can never be met. Therefore, I too imposed a condition which could not be accepted by the plaintiff.
  
 
 
In the event, the defendants have been brought to court for libel in the press statement as they had not confined themselves to the counter challenge. Ling maintained that he knew nothing about the meeting of 6 November nor of the contents or the release of the press statement. Wong and Chee accepted responsibility for it. Wong said that the first paragraph was his contribution. Chee took the stand that the purpose of the press statement was to call on Chiam to resign from the SDP, but he denied that it was to embarrass him.
On the same day, 6 November, Chiam issued a press statement in reply. In it, he stated that the CEC had tried to `slander me by insinuating that I had crossed over to the side of the PAP which they know I shall never do`. He also said that, `They have trivialised the whole matter by setting impossible conditions`. On 10 November, he wrote in his firm`s letterhead to the chairman of the SDP saying that he had not waived his rights to sue the CEC members in respect of the press statement of 6 November.
On 18 January 1996, Chiam`s solicitors wrote individually to the defendants alleging that the 6 November press statement was defamatory of Chiam in that the words were understood to mean: 
 
 
(1) our client is a puppet, stooge and/or lackey of the PAP and responds and reacts according to the praise or otherwise of the PAP; and 
 
(2) our client has compromised his political principle and integrity as an opposition Member of Parliament because of his quest for personal political power and his resentment against the SDP, to the extent of even attempting to destroy his own party.
  
 
 
The letter then went on to allege that these allegations had `brought our client into public scandal, odium, contempt and ridicule.` It demanded a public apology and damages, including aggravated damages for the republications that occurred.
On 27 January 1996, Wong replied to Chiam`s solicitors on behalf of the CEC. The CEC denied that the 6 November statement was defamatory of Chiam in the manner suggested. Wong and Chee testified that they were so advised by Ling. The letter also asserted that in so far as it was alleged that the defendants had said that Chiam had compromised his political principle and integrity, there was sufficient truth to the claim. The CEC threatened to counterclaim for Chiam`s alleged breach of `the deed executed by your client.`
On 1 February, Chee told reporters that the SDP `will not apologise to Chiam for CEC`s remarks`. This was reported in the Straits Times on the next day.
Two days later, Chiam`s solicitors issued a writ against the defendants for libel. In the amended statement of claim, Chiam alleged that the 6 November statement, in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and were understood to mean that: 
 
 
a the plaintiff is a puppet and/or stooge and/or lackey of the People`s Action Party; 
 
b the plaintiff has compromised his principle and integrity as an opposition Member of Parliament because: 
 
i he has aligned himself with the PAP; 
 
ii he responds and reacts to the praise of the PAP and not as a result of independent thought; 
 
c the plaintiff, if invited to do so by the PAP, will betray the cause of the opposition by joining the PAP; 
 
d the plaintiff has persistently and unjustly criticized the SDP because of: 
 
i the reasons set out in paragraphs 5(a) and (b) hereof; and/or 
 
ii his spite and jealousy that SDP was able to carry on without him as its Secretary-General; and/or 
 
iii his desire to destroy the SDP. 
 
e the plaintiff had suddenly and without regard for the SDP`s interests abandoned the SDP by his resignation as secretary-general of the SDP in May 1993; 
 
f the plaintiff had resigned as the secretary-general of the SDP in May 1993 in order to destroy the SDP; 
 
g all the plaintiff`s actions and/or criticisms were motivated by his quest for personal political power; 
 
h the plaintiff is not fit to be an opposition Member of Parliament; 
 
i the plaintiff is not a man of honour and principle by remaining in a party which he does not share the same ideology.
  
 
 
In the alternative, Chiam alleged that the 6 November statement bore those meanings by way of innuendo. He pleaded, by way of particulars to support the innuendo, the events leading to the issue of the 6 November press statement.
The original defences were justification and fair comment, in addition to an insufficiently pleaded denial of defamatory meaning. However, the defence of justification was struck out before the case came to trial on the application of Chiam`s solicitors. Together with Ling, the fourth and the eleventh defendants pleaded that they took no part in the issuance of the 6 November 1995 press statement and that they were not responsible for it. In addition, they pleaded fair comment.
During the trial, Ling indicated that he was not going to give evidence in support of his pleaded defence save for the paragraph denying knowledge or responsibility for the statement. The remaining paragraphs of his defence were accordingly struck out. After Chee had given evidence, the fourth and eleventh defendants decided that they would adopt Ling`s stand at the trial. They confirmed this in the witness box and accordingly, the corresponding parts of their defences were similarly struck out.
As for the fifth to tenth and the twelfth defendants, it was also agreed between the parties that they would adopt Wong and Chee`s stand and evidence, and be liable to the same extent (including malice, if any) as Wong and Chee would be if the 6 November press statement were to be found libellous. Their evidence was therefore restricted to their confirmation of this agreement in the witness box.
 Was the 6 November press statement defamatory? 
The contents of the 6 November press statement has been set out above, as has the manner in which it was alleged to be defamatory of Chiam. The test of whether a statement is defamatory of a person was not disputed. It was also common ground that in Singapore, the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of is decided by the court.
In the well-known case of 
 Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd 
 
[1964] AC 234
, Lord Reid succinctly stated the test at p 259: 
 
Ordinary men and women have different temperaments and outlooks. Some are unusually suspicious and some are unusually naive. One must try to envisage people between those two extremes and see what is the most damaging meaning they would put on the words in question.
 
 
 
In deciding what the natural and ordinary meaning of the words are, the court is required to take into account an ordinary man`s general knowledge of worldly affairs. As was stated by Lord Reid at p 258: 
 
There is no doubt that in actions for libel the question is what the words would convey to the ordinary man: it is not one of construction in the legal sense. The ordinary man does not live in an ivory tower and is not inhibited by a knowledge of the rules of construction. So he can and does read between the lines in the light of his general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs ...
 
 
 
What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But the expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning.
 
 
 
In the present case, it was not disputed that the facts leading to the publication of the 6 November press statement were so well known amongst ordinary persons in Singapore as to constitute common knowledge. Chiam said as much in his pleadings, in the particulars in support of innuendo, though for the same reason, these facts cannot be `special facts` which go to support an innuendo. Accordingly, the claim by Chiam of innuendo must fail.
Reading the press statement as a whole, as I must, the first statement which Chiam takes objection to is, `Of late, Mr Chiam has been highly praised by the PAP and he has also been very supportive of the ruling party in attacking the SDP. That being the case, he should join the PAP.` At the submission stage, it was agreed that the words `of late` refer to the Williams College debate. Thus, the statement means that Chiam in the Williams College debate had been very supportive of the PAP in attacking his own party.
Chiam gave evidence that he was not being supportive of the PAP in that debate in attacking his own party. Assuming for the moment that he was correct, an untrue statement is not necessarily a defamatory statement. In order to be defamatory, a statement must lower Chiam in the estimation of others, or expose him to hatred, contempt or ridicule, and in this context, the views of the community as a whole must be considered, and not just that of a limited class; see 
 Berry v Irish Times 
 [1973] IR 368 and 
 Byrne v Deane 
 
[1937] 1 KB 818
.
In my view, the mere allegation that Chiam has been very supportive of the PAP is not defamatory, for being supportive of the PAP per se cannot lower him in the eyes of right thinking members of the public. Moreover, it was his case that whether he did support the PAP to attack the SDP must depend on the issue at hand. In the Williams College debate, in the words of Chiam, `National interest must rise above party interest.` For this reason, I am of the view that it is not defamatory of Chiam to say that he had been very supportive of the PAP in attacking the SDP.
However, it is defamatory to say of Chiam that in doing so, he is `now showing his spite and jealousy that the SDP has been able to progress without him.` That statement imputes that Chiam sided with the SDP`s political opponent to attack the SDP, not because it was a matter of principle, but because he was motivated by spite and jealousy. It also imputes that Chiam was not loyal to his party because of his own selfish reasons, namely his spite and jealousy against the CEC.
In my view, this imputation is very clear, for in the same paragraph, the statement says, `The CEC will not allow him to destroy the Party again,` there arising the further imputation that it was Chiam`s intention to destroy his own party when he supported the PAP to attack the SDP. It is made even more manifest when the statement later states, `Up until now, all he has shown is a craze for personal political power.`
It is in this context that the words, `As a matter of principle and honour, Mr Chiam must leave the party he disagrees with so much` should be read. The imputation is that Chiam is not a man of principle and honour. I have earlier said that it was common knowledge that the CEC had in the past called for Chiam`s resignation from the SDP and furthermore, that the SDP had expelled him except that that action of the CEC was unsuccessful. So, a reasonable reader would infer from the above statement that Chiam was not a man of honour and principle for remaining in the party he disagrees with.
On this issue, therefore, I am clearly of the view that the 6 November press statement is defamatory of Chiam. The sting of the defamation is that Chiam had been very supportive of the ruling party in attacking the SDP and that in doing so, Chiam was motivated by his spite and jealousy against the CEC and a craze for personal political power, to the extent that he intended to destroy his own party. In doing so, the statement also imputes that Chiam was disloyal to his party for very selfish reasons and that therefore he was not a man of honour or principle.
The question then is whether the sting goes further, to the extent of saying, as Chiam alleged, that he was a `puppet and/or stooge and/or lackey` of the PAP. The words `puppet`, `stooge` and `lackey` are derogatory words meaning someone who does the bidding of another without the will to exercise his own independent thought. These words do not appear in the 6 November press statement and the question I have to decide is whether an ordinary reader could infer that this is what is said of Chiam in the statement.
For it to be so understood, Chiam also relied on the statements that `Mr Chiam has been highly praised by the PAP` and that he had been `very supportive of the ruling party in attacking the SDP` as being false. But I do not see how any reasonable reader would infer that someone who is `highly praised by the PAP` and who has also been `very supportive of the ruling party in attacking` his own party is one who responds and reacts to the praise of the PAP. Nor would a reasonable reader infer that he is someone who has not acted as a result of independent thought, and is therefore a puppet, stooge or lackey of the PAP. In order to arrive at the imputation alleged by Chiam, the reader will have to hold the view that the PAP only praises its `puppet`, `stooge` or `lackey`. That, in my view, is not a reasonable reader of the 6 November press statement.
Nor do I see how a reasonable person will infer that Chiam `will betray the cause of the opposition` (whatever that means) by joining the PAP. There is no such allegation in the press statement, except that there is a challenge made to Chiam to join the PAP. In my view, any reasonable reader, possessed of the common knowledge of the events leading to the publication of this press statement, will come to the conclusion that it was issued in response to Chiam`s challenge of 4 November and that it carried an impossible condition. There was no imputation of any kind in the call for Chiam to join the PAP.
For these reasons, there is likewise no imputation that Chiam is not fit to be an opposition MP, which in any event, is a difficult allegation to understand. Chiam had not put his case so high as to allege that the statement imputed that he is not fit to be an MP; nor can there be any such imputation. However, Chiam would seem to suggest that there is a higher objective `cause for the opposition` but there was no suggestion by Chiam as to what this `cause` is. These alleged imputations of Chiam being unfit to be an opposition MP or that he will `betray the cause of the opposition` are therefore, in my view, without substance. I do not consider that the words in the 6 November press statement are capable of bearing these meanings.
Chiam also complained that the statement `Mr Chiam almost killed the SDP when he abruptly and irresponsibly resigned as secretary-general` was defamatory of him. I agree. It is defamatory to say of someone that when he was in a position of responsibility he had acted irresponsibly. However, I do not agree that the libel goes as far as to impute that Chiam had resigned as secretary-general in order to destroy the SDP. That statement is evidently a statement of opinion as to the result of Chiam`s action in resigning as secretary-general of the SDP. It is to take a long leap from there to say that it is an imputation of intention. I do not think that a reasonable reader will draw that kind of inference.
 The defence of the first, fourth and eleventh defendants 
I have already stated that Ling`s defence was a complete denial of responsibility or knowledge of the press statement. Ling`s evidence was that he did not take part in the meeting of 6 November, that he did not authorise the making or release of the statement and that he knew nothing about it despite being the chairman of the SDP. He even contended that the statement was not a CEC statement. He went so far as to say that until he was cross-examined in court, he formed no view in relation to the statement. This was despite the fact that he had acted as solicitor for the defendants, that he had advised the other defendants that the statement was not defamatory and that he had raised the defences of justification and fair comment. To get a flavour of Ling`s evidence, it is necessary to reproduce an extract of his cross-examination: 
 
 
Q: Do you support the press statement? 
 
A: You see the decision was arrived at by some members of the CEC. I don`t know what transpired at the meeting. If I know what had taken place, probably I would come to the conclusion whether this statement is supportable or not. 
 
Q: As you sit in court today, do you support it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did you take that decision the first time? 
 
A: Now. 
 
Q: When did you first see the press statement? 
 
A: Probably one or two days after the publication. 
 
Q: From that day to this date, you have taken no view on the press statement? 
 
A: As I said earlier, I had nothing to do with that publication, so I didn`t bother to take a view of the press statement. In fact, I did not read the Straits Times thoroughly. 
 
Q: When did you first read the press statement thoroughly? 
 
A: I believe when we received the letter from the plaintiff - I believe it was when the plaintiff made the press statement saying that the statement was insinuating and followed by if we dare to say it in the open. 
 
... 
 
Q: That would be the letter dated 10 November 1995 from the plaintiff to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you approve of the press statement then? 
 
A: I had not made up my mind yet and I believe this letter was referred to a lawyer friend of ours. So, at that time I did not approve of the press statement. 
 
Q: Did you concur with it? 
 
A: I never thought about it. My reason is this letter of the plaintiff is not an indication that action will be commenced. 
 
Q: Did you at that time concur with it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you at that time ratify it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you look at the statement to see who signed it? 
 
A: Actually as I said I went through the press statement. It was none of my business. I read it.
  
 
 
Mr Elias submitted that this evidence coming from Ling, as an officer of the court, as an advocate and solicitor, as a Member of Parliament, and as the chairman of the SDP, flew in the face of commonsense, and was unbelievable. I agree.
Ling gave evidence in the witness box for 3 days. To a large extent this was because of the kind of evidence he gave, which necessitated Mr Elias` extensive cross-examination in order to get straight answers from him. It was only after much vacillation that Ling finally agreed that the CEC meeting which authored the statement was a valid one. He then conceded that under the `Westminster` style of party politics which he claims to practise, he is `by convention` bound by the CEC`s decision to issue the statement, that he must endorse and ratify it and that it did not matter whether he attended the meeting.
Notwithstanding all this, Mr Dube submitted on Ling`s behalf that his evidence was that the press statement was not binding on him because the CEC meeting leading to the issuance of the press statement was not a valid one. Obviously, Mr Dube had misunderstood the effect of Ling`s evidence, for Ling was driven to unreservedly accept that the CEC meeting on 6 November was valid. This can be seen from the following extract of the cross-examination: 
 
 
Q: So in issuing the statement in your absence, the second defendant was perfectly entitled to sign it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So, in the light of that answer, how does it offend cl X(e) (of the SDP constitution)? 
 
A: Your Honour, when I refer to the clause, I`m going on the technicality aspect of it ... but as I (am) saying the fact that because there was more than a quorum, you know, more than a quorum, they have nine of them, the CEC meeting is you know a valid one in that sense because more than a quorum there. It`s a valid one.
  
 
 
When reminded of this evidence, Mr Dube accepted that if the meeting was properly convened, then in the light of Ling`s evidence, Ling, the fourth and eleventh defendants would be vicariously liable for the defamation. So, on the facts I have stated, I hold the said three defendants liable for the libel.
 Fair comment defence of Wong, Chee, the fifth to tenth and twelfth defendants 
The defence of Wong, Chee, the fifth to tenth and twelfth defendants was that the defamatory portions of the 6 November press statement was fair comment on a matter of public importance. As for the law on this, it was accepted that this was as stated by Chao Hick Tin J in 
 Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v Wright Norman & Ors 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 760
 at p 770: 
 
I now turn to consider the defences and, first, fair comment. The burden of proving fair comment rests on the defendants. To succeed on this defence, the defendants must establish these four elements: 
(1) the words complained of are comments, though it may consist of or include inference of facts; 
(2) the comment is on a matter of public interest; 
(3) the comment is based on facts; and 
(4) the comment is one which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved.
 
 
 
So far as the ingredient of public interest is concerned, it was common ground that the subject matter of the press statement satisfies this requirement.
In the re-re-amended defence, the said defendants relied on only three statements of facts in the press statement, namely that Chiam resigned abruptly as the secretary-general of the SDP, that Chiam criticised the SDP and that Chiam was highly praised by the PAP. It was alleged that the rest of the press statement was comment.
In 
 Telnikoff v Matusevich 
 
[1992] 2 AC 343
, it was held that in determining whether a defamatory statement is one of fact or comment, reference may not be made to an outside document. This principle was approved in 
 Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v Wright Norman & Ors 
 (supra). As I understand these two cases, the reason why an outside document could not be referred to was that there were ordinary readers of that libel who might not have read that document, or if they had read it, did not have its terms fully in mind. Thus, it was said by Lord Keith in 
 Telnikoff v Matusevich 
 at p 352 as follows: 
 
The question then arises whether it is permissible to have regard to the whole terms of the plaintiff`s article, not only the sentence from it quoted in the letter, in determining whether paras 6 and 7 of the letter contain statements of fact or are pure comment. In my opinion the letter must be considered on its own. The readers of the letter must have included a substantial number of persons who had not read the article or who, if they had read it, did not have its terms fully in mind. If to such persons the letter appeared in paras 6 and 7 to contain statements of fact about what the plaintiff had written in his article, which as I have already indicated might well be the case, then in the eyes of those persons the plaintiff would clearly be defamed. The matter cannot turn on the likelihood or otherwise of readers of the letter having read the article. In some cases many readers of a criticism of some subject matter may be familiar with that subject matter but in other cases very few may be, for example where that subject matter is a speech delivered to a limited audience. The principle must be the same in either case.
 
 
 
In the present case, it seems to me that there is no reason why I may not have regard to what is within the common knowledge of the reasonable reader when deciding whether a defamatory statement is one of fact or comment. It is after all the same material which I have to and did take into account in determining the natural meaning of the words complained of.
I now turn to apply what I have said to this issue of fair comment. First, looking at the press statement again as a whole, I want to itemise, as I view them, the statement of facts from the comments: 
(a) The statement that Chiam was highly praised by the PAP is a statement of fact which I have already found is not defamatory, even if it is untrue. 
(b) As for the statement that Chiam `has also been very supportive of the ruling party in attacking the SDP`, it was submitted for Chiam that the entire statement is one of fact. I am unable to agree. In the context in which these words were written, I am of the view that the statement that Chiam had attacked the SDP is a statement of fact, but the statement that Chiam had been very supportive of the ruling party in doing so is a comment on that fact. 
(c) Of the statement that `Mr Chiam almost killed the SDP when he abruptly and irresponsibly resigned as secretary-general`, the first part is clearly comment on Chiam, and the second part that he abruptly and irresponsibly resigned as secretary-general of the SDP, is a statement of fact. Further, it is not possible to separate the words `abruptly` from `irresponsibly`, as the defendants sought to do. The two words used in such a close context must have been used deliberately by the drafter. In my view, they are both allegations of facts which I have held are defamatory of Chiam. 
(d) The statement `The CEC will not allow him to destroy the party again`, is clearly a comment on the actions of Chiam: on his attack on the SDP in the Williams College debate. 
(e) Likewise, too, the allegation that `Mr Chiam is now showing his spite and jealousy that the SDP has been able to progress without him` is a comment. 
(f) Lastly, on the statement `Up until now, all he has shown is a craze for personal political power` it is necessary to read these words in the context of the paragraph in which they were found. In that paragraph, it was said that Chiam is welcome to lead the SDP again, but that he must first do certain things. It then alleged that `up until now`, Chiam had only done things that have shown his `craze for personal political power.` It concluded that that is not what the leaders of the SDP want. In the circumstances, it seems quite clear that a reasonable reader will interpret the statement `Up until now, all he has shown is a craze for personal political power` as a statement of fact on which comments were made in the rest of the paragraph.
As one of the main stings of the libel I have found was that Chiam had attacked his own party because of his craze for personal political power, the defendants are liable for this defamatory statement of fact.
Secondly, there is the question of whether there is sufficient substratum of facts to qualify the defamatory comments as fair comment. In this respect, the law is set out in 
 Kemsley v Foot & Ors 
 
[1952] AC 345
. It is not necessary for the facts relied on to support the comment to be set out in the defamatory statement itself, provided that they have been adequately referred to in the statement.
From the three particulars of facts pleaded to support the comments, it is clear that the defendants were relying on the factual matrix of the Williams College debate to found their comments. To the extent that the defendants relied on Chiam`s allegedly abrupt and irresponsible resignation as secretary-general, this cannot form part of the substratum, for it was a defamatory statement of fact which the defendants have not sought to justify. As for the statement of fact that Chiam was highly praised by the PAP, even if it was true, I fail to see how this can form the substratum for the defamatory comments. So, this leaves only the Williams College debate.
I have noted that the motion for the Williams College debate was proposed by a PAP MP. And, in that debate Chiam voted in favour of the motion to censure his own party. So, there can be no doubt that there is sufficient substratum of facts for the comment that Chiam had been `very supportive of the ruling party in attacking the SDP.` As the motion to censure the SDP can legitimately be construed as an attack on the SDP, the stand taken by the defendants that Chiam had attacked the SDP is true. Therefore, it could be said that there was sufficient substratum for the comments that Chiam was actuated by spite or jealousy and that his intention was to destroy the SDP.
However, on the facts I have stated I have little doubt that Wong, Chee, the fifth to the tenth and the twelfth defendants were actuated by express malice when they published the press statement. There is clear evidence that by the time of the Williams College debate there was bad blood between Chiam and the CEC, in particular Wong and Chee. Similarly too, the offending press statement was in response to Chiam`s press statement of 4 November in which Chiam had challenged Chee (and the CEC) to stand against him in Potong Pasir. The CEC considered Chiam`s challenge a ridiculous one, and so they issued a counter-challenge which Chiam said had `trivialised` his challenge `by setting impossible conditions`.
So, the irresistible inference must be that the offending press statement was released to embarrass Chiam for the challenge he made on 4 November. In the words of Mr Elias for Chiam, the press statement was made to `down` Chiam. In my view, this was an improper motive for the issue of the offending press statement. This constitutes express malice. This is why the defence of fair comment must, in any event, fail.
For all these reasons, Wong, Chee, the fifth to tenth and the twelfth defendants are also liable for the libel contained in the 6 November press statement.
 Damages 
It remains for me to assess damages. On the facts I have found, the damages Chiam can claim are compensatory. It is trite law that the quantum of the damages must be sufficient to vindicate his reputation and to compensate him for his injured feelings.
In assessing the damages, in addition to the general matters referred to by counsel in their submissions, in this case there are the following facts to be borne in mind. One, the common knowledge that the offending press statement was issued in the course of an internal political squabble between Chiam and the CEC which each carried out in the media. In the circumstances, a reasonable reader would more likely to be sceptical about what was stated in the offending press statement. It is a natural reaction for a reader to discount what is said disparagingly of a man when he knows that the words were said by the man`s enemies.
Two, for the same reasons, the injury to Chiam`s feelings would also be less. That this was the case is clearly shown in Chiam`s press statement of the same day in reply to the offending press statement stating that he was `disappointed` with the stand taken by the CEC who had `trivialised the whole matter by setting impossible conditions`, and further that the CEC `tries to slander me by insinuation`. As Mr Dube submitted for the defendants, his initial reaction was not of a man who was gravely injured in his feelings to the offending press statement. However, it must also be said the next day Chiam gave notice to the chairman of the SDP, Ling, that he reserved his `legal rights to sue for damages in relation to the said press statement`.
Three, when it came to legal proceedings, Chiam put his case so high as to allege that the defendants in defaming him were imputing that he is a stooge, lackey or puppet of the PAP and that he is unfit to be an opposition MP. It would appear that Chiam considered this to be the main sting of the libel. As I have explained, this I cannot find on the facts.
Four, I cannot agree with Chiam when he said that the conditions he had imposed in his 4 November press statement challenging Chee (and the CEC) to stand against him in a by-election in Potong Pasir were not impossible to perform. Neither Chiam nor Mr Elias on his behalf could make clear to me how the challenge would be successfully implemented. Leaving aside the internal strife that would erupt, of calling all the CEC and cadre members to resign, the challenge thrown by Chiam was a ridiculous one.
In my view, the challenge was flawed. As I see it if Chiam resigns from the SDP and runs against Chee in a by-election, he obviously cannot run under the SDP`s banner. So even if he wins and accepting his evidence that the mechanism is in place for him to resume the helm of the SDP, the simple fact is that Chiam cannot take his seat in Parliament for he did not win the election under the SDP banner. I therefore cannot see how he can be heard to say that he was gravely injured in his feelings when his challenge was trivialised.
Five, Mr Elias claimed damages for Chiam for injury to his reputation as an advocate and solicitor. In my view, damages would have to be given for the imputation that Chiam is not a man of principle or honour. However, as the libel was in relation to Chiam`s political life, and would be so understood by the ordinary reader, it cannot be aggravated damages.
Six, a claim for aggravated damages was sought for Chiam on the failure on the part of the defendants to apologise. In this context, it must be borne in mind that Chiam`s solicitors` letter of 18 January had demanded that the defendants apologise for imputing that Chiam was a stooge, lackey or puppet of the PAP and that he had compromised his integrity and principle as an opposition MP. As this has not been made good in the trial, the claim for aggravated damages for failure to apologise does not arise. However, the defendants on their part could have replied to say that the press statement was not defamatory in the manner alleged but that it could be defamatory in a lesser way, and offered to apologise for that. Instead, Chee made a statement to the press that the SDP will not apologise. So, I would give some damages in this regard.
Seven, having regard to s 18 of the Defamation Act, I am of the view that the common law rule in 
 Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome 
 
[1972] AC 1027
 that damages is assessed according to the lowest common denominator amongst defendants is not applicable in Singapore. It seems to me that s 18 is only workable if the highest point is taken as the starting point. This means taking into account all the circumstances and determining how much the person most culpable is liable for. If mitigation is claimed by some of the defendants, then the onus is on them to make an application under s 18, so that the court can consider the relevant matters concerning them. In this action, none of the defendants have applied for damages to be assessed separately.
Eight, I must take into account the conduct of the defendants in these proceedings. On Ling, I have earlier, in considering his liability for the libel, touched on his evidence. His evidence that as chairman of the SDP, he knew nothing about the offending press statement and had taken no stand on it was ludicrous, bearing in mind that he had also acted as solicitor for the other defendants. Here I would add that except, where from a line of questions, he was compelled to concede or admit to material facts, and even then grudgingly, he was often evasive in the witness box and his evidence left much to be desired. I would say that his conduct on the matters thrown up in this case, considered as a whole, was deplorable. In my view, the kind of evidence he gave in court had the effect of exacerbating the libel.
Nine, as for Wong and Chee, I have to take into account that they had sought to justify the libel even when they were in the witness box. In particular, Wong had maintained that Chiam was a man of no political principles. Chee had also said that Chiam had jumped on the PAP`s bandwagon. Both of them had also tried to give the impression that they had been very accommodating of Chiam up till the time of the libel and that it was Chiam who had rebuffed their attempts. However, it is clear to me on the evidence that by 16 August 1993 neither of them regarded Chiam as a member of the SDP.
Ten, it is of course a serious libel to say of an opposition MP that he is a lackey, stooge, or puppet of the ruling party, and if this is on a balance of probabilities proved, I would agree with Mr Elias that the damages would be more substantial than I am going to award. However, for reasons I have given, this imputation has not been proved.
Now, on the authorities for damages cited to me, this case is unlike that in 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur & Ors 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 542
, where the libel on the Senior Minister was published by a reputable publication and had appeared to have been written by an unbiased observer. I also do not find 
 Chew Chin Tong Ernest & Anor v Chee Soon Juan 
 (Suit No 955/93) (unreported) and 
 S Vasoo v Chee Soon Juan 
 (Suit No 936/93) (unreported) useful as I was only given the formal judgments.
On the findings I have made on the evidence, and taking into consideration all the factors I have enumerated above, I am of the view that the sum of $120,000 will assuage the injured feelings and restore the reputation of Chiam.
The plaintiff is entitled to the costs of this action. As regards apportionment of costs against the defendants, I am of the view that this court can express its disapproval of the conduct of some of the defendants. But any order that I can make will depend on whether there is an application by the several defendants. So, I give liberty to the defendants to make an application if they want to on a date to be fixed by the registrar.

are charged that you, on 25 Sept 96 at about 0845 hours, at the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint, Singapore, did engage in the business of conveying to Singapore in a motor vehicle JAY 1334, one Veeraiah Thangamani, an Indian National whom you knew or had reasonable grounds for believing to be a prohibited immigrant and you have thereby committed an offence under s 57(1)(c) of the Immigration Act (Chapter 133) punishable under s 57(1)(iii) of the same Act.
 
 
 
According to the statement of facts tendered by the prosecution, the appellant was a lorry driver who had colluded with a male Indian named Segar to convey an Indian national named Veeraiah Thangamani (Veeraiah) into Singapore. The appellant was paid RM$100 by Segar for doing so. He was also informed that Veeraiah had no passport. The whole operation took place on 25 September 1996 and involved Veeraiah lying down at the rear of the appellant`s lorry, covered with a piece of canvas, whilst the appellant drove through the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint. Unfortunately for the appellant and Veeraiah, immigration officers ambushed the lorry after it had already cleared the immigration checkpoint. The appellant was arrested and appeared in person before a district judge a few days later. He pleaded guilty to the charge set out above and was sentenced to two years` imprisonment, with three strokes of the cane. He brought an appeal against sentence as well as (subsequently) an application for criminal revision.
On 21 January 1997 both the appeal against sentence and the application for criminal revision came up for hearing before me (the appellant being legally represented by this stage). I dismissed them and now set out my reasons in writing.
 The criminal revision 
In respect of the application for revision, counsel for the appellant relied on three broad grounds. He pointed out, first, that the statement of facts adduced below showed the appellant to have engaged in only one isolated act of conveying a prohibited immigrant into Singapore. Counsel contended that, in order for the appellant to be convicted under s 57(1)(c) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Ed) (the Act), he must be shown to have engaged in more than a single act of conveying a prohibited immigrant: he must, in counsel`s words, be shown to have acted with some degree of `system, repetition and continuity`; and there was no evidence of such conduct in the statement of facts.
Counsel further referred me to s 57(6) of the Act, which provides: 
 
Where, in any proceedings for an offence under ss (1)(c), it is proved that the defendant has conveyed any prohibited immigrant in any vehicle, vessel, aircraft or train, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that he is engaged in the business or trade of conveying to Singapore in or on that vehicle, vessel, aircraft or train that prohibited immigrant knowing him to be, or having reasonable grounds for believing him to be, a prohibited immigrant.
 
 
 
Counsel submitted that if the prosecution were relying in any way on this presumption, they should have included it in the charge against the appellant. Their omission to do so, he said, was fatal because it rendered the appellant`s plea of guilt equivocal.
Lastly, counsel contended that in any case the appellant was capable of rebutting the presumption in s 57(6) even on the prosecution`s own evidence: he reiterated that the statement of facts revealed no more than one isolated transaction; and this, in his submission, was insufficient to constitute the offence under s 57(1)(c).
 `Business` 
So far as the first ground of revision was concerned, the presumption provided for in s 57(6) of the Act must be borne in mind. I have set out the provision above and it is plain from its terms that a single act of conveying a prohibited immigrant is enough to bring the presumption into operation. The appellant`s act of conveying Veeraiah in his lorry was clearly specified in the statement of facts; and once the presumption in s 57(6) was given effect, the onus shifted to the appellant to show that he was not in any way engaged in the business of conveying a prohibited immigrant to Singapore. In the event, of course, he elected to plead guilty. The point is, however, that the onus was never on the prosecution to prove that the appellant had engaged in such business, but on the appellant to rebut the presumption of this fact. Counsel was wrong, therefore, to say that the prosecution `must prove` more than a single act of conveying a prohibited immigrant.
The above really disposed of the appellant`s first ground of revision. Having regard, however, to the written arguments produced by counsel, I felt it necessary to deal in some detail with the scope of the word `business` as used in s 57(1)(c). I did not accept counsel`s submission that the word `business` in this section connoted some sense of system and continuity, or that the offence under s 57(1)(c) required an accused to have engaged in more than a single act of conveying a prohibited immigrant.
Counsel`s arguments in this respect were based - somewhat surprisingly - on my judgment in 
 Ng Kum Peng v PP 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 231
. The appellant in Ng`s case faced three charges of carrying on the business of a moneylender without a licence, contrary to s 8(b) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188). In convicting him, the district judge relied on the presumption in s 3 that a person who lent money in return for interest was a moneylender. I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against conviction and sentence; and, in the course of my judgment, I held that that once an accused was shown to have lent money in return for interest, the onus lay on him to rebut the s 3 presumption by proving that he did not have a `business` of moneylending. I stated further that he would generally do so by showing that the loans made were not `part of an ongoing and routine series of transactions` - that there was no system and continuity to his loan transactions.
On the basis of these remarks, counsel in the present case contended that the word `business` in s 57(1)(c) must also mean that the section required more than one act of conveying a prohibited immigrant. This was, in my view, an erroneous position. The definition accorded to `business` in 
 Ng 
`s case was plainly intended to be applicable to the context of the Moneylenders Act; and nowhere in the judgment was there a suggestion that this definition of `business` should apply to some other scenario.
Indeed, in the present case, there were good reasons why it should not be applicable. So far as the Moneylenders Act is concerned, one of its main aims is to eradicate organised moneylending. This has to be distinguished from occasional loans: hence, the requirement of system and continuity in an accused`s loan transactions before he may be said to be carrying on the `business` of moneylending.
The same considerations do not prevail in respect of the Immigration Act. This Act seeks inter alia to deny entry into Singapore to persons falling within any `prohibited class`; and to punish persons who succeed in illegally gaining entry as well as those who assist them. Such assistance may be rendered on a `one-off` basis; or it may be part of a long-standing routine: the former is no less inimical to our strict immigration policies than is the latter. In short, there is no reason why the Act should only catch out persons who render assistance to prohibited immigrants on a long-standing basis; and no reason, therefore, to say that an offence under s 57(1)(c) is established only where an accused has undertaken the conveyance of prohibited immigrants into Singapore with some degree of `system and continuity`.
 Rebutting the presumption in section 57(6) 
In the light of the above reasoning, I also rejected the appellant`s third ground of revision, namely, that the statement of facts revealed only one isolated incident and that he had, accordingly, rebutted the presumption in s 57(6) anyway.
 Whether the presumption should have been stated in the charge 
As to the appellant`s second ground of revision, I found this to be without merit either. I agreed with the DPP that the presumption in s 57(6), being no more than an evidentiary provision, did not need to be included in the charge. In this respect I relied on the case of 
 Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 253
, in which the Court of Appeal said of the presumption provided in s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act: 
 
[I]t is ... wholly unnecessary to make any reference to that section in the charge ... It is an evidential section; it raises a rebuttable presumption of a certain fact and is no different from the other sections raising rebuttable presumptions of certain facts, eg ss 18-22 of the Act.
 
 
 
The above remarks were, in my view, plainly applicable to the presumption in s 57(6) of the Immigration Act, in so far as the issue of its inclusion in the charge against the appellant was concerned. Furthermore, it was clear from the notes of evidence that both the charge and the statement of facts were read out to the appellant; that the appellant had the aid of a Tamil court interpreter; and that the district court proceeded to convict him only after he had indicated his understanding of the nature and consequences of his guilty plea. I could see no basis, in short, for concluding that the appellant lacked a full awareness of the nature of the charge against him.
 The appeal against sentence 
As to the appellant`s appeal against sentence, counsel submitted in his written arguments that the sentence imposed by the district judge was `not in accordance with the law`. In his grounds of decision, the district judge had stated that the sentence of two years` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane was the mandatory minimum stipulated for an offence under s 57(1)(c). Counsel contended that this was wrong. According to counsel, the punishment provided for under s 57(1)(iii) was actually imprisonment and a fine and/or caning. This being the case, caning could not be mandatory.
From counsel`s written arguments, however, it appeared that he had consulted the 1985 edition of the Immigration Act, in which edition s 57(1)(iii) had indeed read as follows: 
 
in the case of an offence under paragraph (c) [an accused] shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than 2 years and not more than 5 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 and to caning ...
 
 
 
In 1989, however, the section was amended; and in the 1995 edition of the Act, it now reads:in the case of an offence under paragraph (c) [an accused] shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 2 years and not more than 5 years and shall also be punished, subject to section 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code, with caning with not less than 3 strokes ...
Clearly, therefore, the sentence imposed on the appellant was the mandatory minimum and I saw no grounds for disturbing it in any way.

Cur Adv Vult
 
(delivering the judgement of the court): This appeal arose out of an explosion that occurred on board the `Lotus M` now named `Pretty` (Lotus M) on 16 February 1992. At the time of the tragedy, the appellants` (Sunray Marine`s) workmen were on board the Lotus M doing repair works. As a result of the explosion, five workmen were found dead, five missing and presumed dead and many were injured. Consequently, Sunray Marine as the employer of the workmen paid compensation under the Workmen`s Compensation Act (Cap 354) (the Act) to those who proceeded under the Act amounting to $348,946.62 (the compensation). Three of the injured however chose to proceed at common law against Sunray Marine for damages and loss sustained by them as a result of the explosion.
Sunray Marine having paid the compensation brought an action claiming: 
(a) an indemnity under s 18(b) of the Act from the respondents (the shipowner) for the amount paid; and 
(b) a declaration that it is entitled to be indemnified by the shipowner in respect of the three common law claims.
The trial judge awarded Sunray Marine the indemnity under s 18(b) of the Act but refused to grant them the declaration. The present appeal relates to the trial judge`s refusal to grant the declaration to Sunray Marine. The decision of the trial judge in granting the indemnity under s 18(b) of the Act was appealed against in CA 203/96. That appeal was dismissed by this court earlier in October last year. The judgment is reported at 
[1998] 1 SLR 1
.
The Lotus M is a motor tanker of 16,793 gross tons. Her port of registry is Panama and her owners at the material time were Easy Shipping Corporation of Liberia. Her operators were Navix Line Ltd of Japan whose local representative was Navship (Singapore) Pte Ltd (Navship). The Lotus M was generally deployed to transport petroleum products including naphtha. Her forward section is divided into fifteen cargo tanks, five each on port, centre and starboard, and two slop tanks. The proceedings involve the No 5 centre tank.
Sunray Marine is a company specialising in ship repairs. On 7 February 1992, Sunray Marine had been contacted by one Nagase (Nagase), the superintendent in the employment of Navship, the agents for the owners of Lotus M. Nagase informed Sunray Marine that he wished to engage its services to conduct repair works on board the Lotus M.
On 10 or 11 February 1992, a representative of Sunray Marine, a foreman with the company, one Chu Yeng Choon (Chu) and Nagase went on board the Lotus M to conduct an inspection of the vessel. Chu then met the Master, Captain Yasunosuke Kato (the Master), the Chief Officer, Toru Sato (the Chief Officer) and the Chief Engineer. After some discussion as to the scope of the work Sunray Marine was going to carry out, a list of repairs was drawn up.
Some of the repairs involved cutting and welding, basically `hot work`. Chu therefore informed the Master, the Chief Officer, the Chief Engineer and Nagase that the tanks must be gas free. They therefore assured him that the tanks would be gas freed prior to Sunray Marine`s commencement of work.
The Lotus M then continued her services deploying cargo. The last consignment of naphtha before the commencement of the repairs was discharged at 0620 hours on 14 February 1992 at the Van Ommeren Terminal after which at about 1215 hours Lotus M left for the South China Seas to gas free her tanks. The next voyage of Lotus M was to Kerteh, Trengganu, Malaysia with an expected time of arrival there at 11am on 18 February 1992.
The whole gas freeing operation was conducted by the Chief Officer. Gas freeing can be done either by the use of inert gas fans to pump in inert gas or by water driven fans to blow fresh air into the tanks. The use of inert gas is considered to be the safer method. Both methods were used on board the Lotus M. However, for the No 5 centre tank, gas freeing was done by the blowing of fresh air with portable water-driven fans placed on deck. This was followed by ventilation of the tank for three to four hours.
The anchored position of the Lotus M, when Sunray Marine`s workmen boarded her for the repair works, was approximately one nautical mile outside the boundary of the port limits as defined by s 3(1) of the Port of Singapore Authority Act. This location although outside port limits was within Singapore territorial waters.
Sixty-one workmen from Sunray Marine were mobilised for the repair works. The boats they were in arrived alongside Lotus M at about 1130 hours on 15 February 1992. Nagase was in one of the boats with them. They were transferred onto the Lotus M along with fabricated parts and equipment needed for the repairs. Work commenced at 1600 hours but Nagase instructed Chu that no `hot work` was permitted pending completion of desloping whereby the slop was discharged into a barge.
The desloping works were completed at 1630 hours on 15 February 1992. Chu then sought permission from Nagase to commence `hot work` but was told that no `hot work` could be carried out before all the tank`s openings had been closed or covered. The Chief Officer checked the gas readings of all tanks and found them to be less than 2% of the lower explosive limit. Gas freeing was intended to reduce the concentration of hydro-carbon vapours to bring it to less than 10% of the lower explosive limit. However, he had only taken one sample from each tank. They were taken from a depth of about 12m from the main deck. After the Chief Officer was satisfied with the gas readings taken by him, he had all the hatches closed.
Chu was then instructed to commence `hot work`. Work proceeded uneventfully and stopped at 0200 hours on 16 February 1992 when the workmen retired for the night during which they slept on board. Work resumed at 0800 hours on the same day. At 0935 hours a violent explosion took place at the deck above the No 5 centre tank.
We will only deal with the portion of the trial judge`s decision which is relevant to the present appeal. The trial judge had found the shipowner solely to blame for the accident and had therefore granted Sunray Marine the indemnity under s 18(b) of the Act. This decision has been confirmed by this court. As for the declaration to be indemnified against the common law claims, the trial judge relied on s 11(1)(c) and (2) of the Civil Law Act which states: 
 
 
11(1) Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime or not) -
  
 
 
 
(c) 
 any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage 
 may recover contribution from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued have been liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise, so however, that no person shall be entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of which the contribution is sought. [Emphasis added.]
  
 
 
 
11(2) In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person`s responsibility for the damage; and the court shall have power to exempt any person from liability to make contribution, or to direct that the contribution to be recovered from any person shall amount to complete indemnity.
  
 
 
The trial judge felt that based on s 11(1)(c) and (2) of the Civil Law Act, Sunray Marine would only be entitled to an indemnity or contribution in respect of the additional claim only if it had liability at law as a joint or several tortfeasor for damages sustained by the plaintiffs in the common law claims. He therefore found that the claim for the declaration to be indemnified was inconsistent with Sunray Marine`s entitlement to the s 18(b) claim and that the two claims were mutually exclusive. If Sunray Marine succeeded in one, it must fail in the other. As the trial judge had found that the explosion had been caused under circumstances which did not create liability on the part of Sunray Marine, he made no order on the declaration claim.
The issue raised by the parties in this appeal is whether an innocent party is allowed to obtain an indemnity from the wrongdoer for any damages the innocent party had to pay to the injured party, at common law, independent of any contract.
In the present case, even though the shipowner was found to be solely liable for the accident, the present issue is not purely academic since Sunray Marine is still liable to pay damages to one of the common law claimants, one Ang Kim Soon (Ang). The other two common law claims have been settled under compensation paid out under the Act. Ang had sued Sunray Marine, as his employer for damages for his injuries sustained as a result of the explosion. Sunray Marine had allowed judgment in default to be entered against it. This was before the main admiralty action, Admiralty in Rem No 399/92 was heard. In Admiralty in Rem No 399/92 which is the subject of the present appeal, as mentioned above, the trial judge had found the shipowner to be solely liable. After the judgment of the admiralty action was given, Sunray Marine succeeded in setting aside the judgment in default. However this was overturned in the High Court and the appeal to this court from the High Court`s decision in Civil Appeal No 82/96 was also dismissed. Therefore, a judgment in default in respect of Ang against Sunray Marine still stands. Sunray Marine will therefore have to pay damages to Ang but is trying to obtain an indemnity from the shipowner, the real tortfeasor, in the present appeal.
At common law the general rule for both joint and several tortfeasors causing the same damage was that there could be no award of contribution or indemnity between them in the absence of an express or implied agreement which was not itself void as contrary to public policy. The enactment of s 6(1)(c) of the Law Reform (Married Women & Joint Tortfeasors) Act 1935, which was subsequently repealed by the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 (the 1978 Act) changed that position to allow for contribution between tortfeasors. Section 1(1) of the 1978 Act provides that: ` any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise)`. The wording in s 11 of our Civil Law Act is similar to that in s 1(1) of the 1978 Act. The words `any tortfeasor` are however used in the place of the words `any person` in the 1978 Act.
As the trial judge noted, s 11 of the Civil Law Act would cover positions where the claimant was a joint or several tortfeasor. On joint tortfeasors, 45 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
(4th Ed) para 1234 states: 
 
The following are joint tortfeasors: 
(1) employer and employee where the employer is vicariously liable for the tort of the employee; 
(2) principal and agent where the principal is liable for the tort of the agent; 
(3) employer and independent contractor where the employer is liable for the tort of his independent contractor; 
(4) a person who instigates another to commit a tort and the person who then commits the tort; 
(5) persons who take concerted action to a common end and in the course of executing that joint purpose commit a tort.
 
 
 
As for several tortfeasors, 45 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) at para 1235 states: 
 
If each of several persons, not acting in concert, commits a tort against another person substantially contemporaneously and causing the same or indivisible damage, each several tortfeasor is liable for the whole damage.
 
 
 
As seen, Sunray Marine clearly did not fall within either category as the shipowner was found to be the sole tortfeasor. Therefore, the trial judge was correct in finding that based on the Civil Law Act, Sunray Marine was not entitled to an indemnity from the shipowner. The Civil Law Act however only covers situations where the claimant is a joint or several tortfeasor. The question then is what if Sunray Marine is not a tortfeasor?
There is no denying that Ang, the sole remaining common law claimant, was injured by the explosion on the Lotus M on 16 February 1992 in the course of his employment with Sunray Marine. There is also no denying that in law Sunray Marine has a duty to take reasonable care to provide a safe system of work for Ang when working on the Lotus M. It is settled law that such a duty of care is either personal or non-delegable meaning, `that if (the duty) is not performed, it is no defence for the employer to show that he delegated its performance to a person, whether his servant or not his servant, whom he reasonably believed to be competent to perform it. Despite such delegation the employer is liable for the non-performance of the duty` - per Lord Brandon in 
McDermid v Nash Dredging and Reclamation Co Ltd
 
[1987] AC 906
 at p 919C-D, a case which we will refer to at length later.
On the facts as found by the learned judge Sunray Marine is not a joint tortfeasor with the shipowner and is innocent of the act or omission which caused the explosion on the Lotus M on 16 February 1992. Be that as it may, in our view, the crucial question is whether Sunray Marine is liable to Ang for failing to take reasonable care to provide him with a safe system of work and, if so, whether in all the circumstances, Sunray Marine ought to be granted a declaration that it be indemnified by the shipowner in respect of Ang`s claim.
This was the approach taken by the English Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in 
 McDermid 
, a case which has striking similarities with this appeal that we are somewhat surprised that it was not cited to us at the hearing of the appeal. The headnote reads as follows: 
 
The plaintiff was employed by the defendants as a deckhand. In the course of his employment he worked on board a tug owned by a Dutch company and under the control of a Dutch captain employed by them. The plaintiff`s work included untying ropes mooring the tug fore and aft to a dredger. The system used by the captain was that when the plaintiff had untied the ropes and it was safe for the captain to move the tug the plaintiff would give a double knock with his hand on the wheelhouse. At the time in question the plaintiff had untied the aft rope but was still in the course of untying the forward rope when the captain, without waiting for the plaintiff`s signal, put the engine of the tug hard astern. As a result, the rope snaked round the plaintiff`s leg, causing him serious injury. On his claim against the defendants for damages for, inter alia, negligence, Staughton J held that his injuries had been caused by the captain`s negligence, that the captain was to be deemed to have acted as the defendants` employee and that, therefore, the defendants were vicariously liable for his negligence to the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the defendants on the question of liability
 
 
 
On appeal by the defendants:
 
 
 
Held, dismissing the appeal: (1) that the defendants owed the plaintiff a duty of care to devise a safe system of work for him and to see that that system was operated; that assuming that the captain`s system of waiting for a double knock on the wheelhouse before putting the tug in motion could be called a safe system it had not been operated at the time of the plaintiff`s accident and the captain`s negligence in not operating it had not been casual or collateral but had been central to the operation of the system; that the defendants` duty of care was non-delegable in the sense that they were personally liable for its performance and could not escape their liability if it was delegated and not properly performed; and that, accordingly, although they had delegated the performance of their duty of care to the captain, they could not thereby avoid their own liability to the plaintiff.
 
 
 
It is evident from 
 McDermid 
`s case that injuries caused by a breach of an employer`s duty to his employee to take reasonable care to provide a safe system of work must be distinguished from a claim in tort for injuries arising from a negligent act or omission by someone other than the employer.
The difficulty we are faced with is that Sunray Marine had an interlocutory judgment in default of defence entered against it and it subsequently failed to get the interlocutory judgment set aside with the result that Sunray Marine is in the invidious position of having damages assessed against it without there being a trial on liability and findings of fact being made in support of Ang`s claim. It is in respect of these damages that Sunray Marine seeks the declaration of indemnity against the shipowner on the basis, as the learned judge found, that the shipowner was solely responsible for the explosion on the Lotus M on 16 February 1992 which caused Ang the injuries.
Given that the shipowner is solely responsible for the explosion, it is in our judgment a necessary prerequisite to the declaration for an indemnity that Sunray Marine is or can be, on such facts that have been proved or undisputed, legally liable to Ang for the injuries suffered by him as a result of the explosion. It is therefore necessary to see first how Ang pleaded his case against Sunray Marine.
In the statement of claim in DC Suit No 5083/94 dated 13 January 1995 Ang by para 2 averred that: 
 
It was the duty of the defendants (Sunray Marine) to take all reasonable precautions for the safety of the plaintiff while he was engaged upon the said employment, not to expose the plaintiff to a risk of damage or injury of which they knew or ought to have known, and to provide a safe place of work and a safe and proper system of working.
 
 
 
In para 4 of the statement of claim Ang averred that his injuries, loss and damage were occasioned by Sunray Marine`s `negligence and/or breach of duty` or that of its servants or agents. The following particulars of negligence were given which we set out verbatim: 
 
 
(a) Failing to take any or any adequate precautions for the safety of the plaintiff while he was engaged upon the said work; 
 
(b) exposing the plaintiff to a risk of damage or injury of which they knew or ought to have known; 
 
(c) failing to provide a safe place of work for the plaintiff; 
 
(d) causing or permitting their servants or agents to carry out welding works to be carried out near where the plaintiff was working; 
 
(e) causing or permitting welding works to be carried out near where the plaintiff was working without taking precaution and/or without providing protection for the plaintiff; 
 
(f) causing or permitting welding works to be carried out where it was unsafe or dangerous to do so.
  
 
 
Notwithstanding the repetitious nature of these particulars it is evident that most of them are particulars also of the breach of duty to take reasonable care to provide a safe system of work; and it is clear to us beyond peradventure that the principal or main cause of action relied on by Ang is the breach of duty of care rather than the tort of negligence.
We cannot emphasise too strongly that the duty to take reasonable care to provide a safe system of work rests on the employer and that it is non-delegable. This was made clear by the two Law Lords who delivered the only speeches in 
 McDermid 
. Lord Hailsham said this at p 910F-H: 
 
The plaintiff`s claim in the proceedings was based on the allegation, inter alia, of a `non-delegable` duty resting on his employers to take reasonable care to provide a `safe system of work`: cf 
Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English
 
[1938] AC 57
. The defendants did not, and could not, dispute the existence of such a duty of care, nor that it was `non-delegable` in the special sense in which the phrase is used in this connection. This special sense does not involve the proposition that the duty cannot be delegated in the sense that it is incapable of being the subject of delegation, but only that the employer cannot escape liability if the duty has been delegated and then not properly performed. Equally the defendants could not and did not attempt to dispute that it would be a central and crucial feature of any safe system on the instant facts that it would prevent so far as possible the occurrence of such an accident as actually happened,
 
 
 
After discussing the facts, Lord Hailsham concluded this part of his judgment at p 911G-H, thus: 
 
It matters not whether one says that there was no `system` in operation at all, or whether one says that the system provided was unsafe, or whether one says that the system in fact provided was not in use at the crucial stage. 
 In any event the defendants had delegated their duty to the plaintiff to Captain Sas, the duty had not been performed, and the defendants must pay for the breach of their `non-delegable` obligation.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Lord Brandon stated the relevant principles applicable more succinctly. At p 919B-D he said: 
 
My Lords, the Court of Appeal regarded the case as raising difficult questions of law on which clear authority was not easy to find. With great respect to the elaborate judgment of that court, I think that they have treated the case as more difficult than it really is. A statement of the relevant principle of law can be divided into three parts. First, an employer owes to his employee a duty to exercise reasonable care to ensure that the system of work provided for him is a safe one. Secondly, the provision of a safe system of work has two aspects: (a) the devising of such a system and (b) the operation of it. Thirdly, the duty concerned has been described alternatively as either personal or non-delegable. The meaning of these expressions is not self-evident and needs explaining. 
 The essential characteristic of the duty is that, if it is not performed, it is no defence for the employer to show that he delegated its performance to a person, whether his servant or not his servant, whom he reasonably believed to be competent to perform it. Despite such delegation the employer is liable for the non-performance of the duty
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
This law is free from all doubt. It only remains for us to examine the proven and undisputed facts in this appeal to assess, if they were the only facts at the trail, whether Ang would or would likely have succeeded in his pleaded case against Sunray Marine.
The Lotus M is a regular carrier of inflammable cargo. It is known that her last consignment was naphta. It is an accepted fact that gas freeing of a tanker`s tanks is done either by pumping inert gas into the tank so as to blow out the flammable hydro-carbon vapours or by blowing fresh air into the tanks by water driven fans placed on deck followed by three to four hours of ventilation to achieve the same result. It is accepted that the former is the safer and more reliable method. A tank is said to be gas free when the concentration of hydro-carbon vapours has been reduced to less than 10% of the lower explosive limit. This reading is made by the use of specially designed gas-readings meters. The whole operation is carried out at sea.
In the case of the No 5 tank where the explosion occurred the method employed was the latter one of blowing in fresh air by the use of water driven fans placed on deck. This is the less effective method. No explanation was given why this method was chosen for No 5 tank. There was no evidence of the cubic capacity or the dimension of No 5 tank. So no view could be formed whether it was a `safe system` to use this method rather than the more effective method of pumping in inert gas. In any event the learned judge made a finding that No 5 tank was inadequately gas freed. In doing so he accepted the evidence of the expert witnesses testifying for Sunray Marine which the expert witness for the shipowner did not dispute.
The taking of gas readings is crucial in this case. In respect of tank No 5 the evidence is that only one reading was taken by lowering gas reading meter 12m from the main deck. In appears that this was the same with the other tanks as well. This was done shortly after 1630 hours on 15 February 1992. The hatches were then closed and work began which included cutting and welding, the so-called `hot work`.
It seems to us that one single reading taken at a level of 12m below the main leak of a tank of a tanker which regularly carried inflammable cargoes in her tanks is barely sufficient to reasonably assume that that tank was gas free even if the reading was as low as 2% of the lower explosive limit. This alone is sufficient evidence of the breach of duty of care which was owed to Ang in not devising and operating a safe system of work for him and when it is added to the other matters we have referred in [para ] 33 to 35 above the conclusion is irresistible that Ang would most likely have succeeded in proving that reasonable care had not been taken in providing him with a safe system of work.
The learned judge found that the shipowner having undertaken to gas free the Lotus M has not done so and thus was solely responsible for the explosion. As between Sunray Marine and the shipowner it may be quite proper from Sunray Marine as a term of their contractual relationship to require the shipowner to gas free the Lotus M and for Sunray Marine to rely on the shipowner`s assurance that the Lotus M was gas free and for the `hot work` work to commence and be carried on. However, as we have seen from 
 McDermid 
 the relationship between Sunray Marine and Ang is quite different from the relationship between Sunray Marine and the shipowner. Different legal obligations arise and the principal legal obligation that arises between Sunray Marine and Ang is that there is in law a duty on Sunray Marine to exercise reasonable care to ensure that the system of work provided for Ang is a safe one; furthermore the legal duty is such that, to quote the words of Lord Brandon, if it is not performed, it is no defence for Sunray Marine to show that it delegated its performance to the shipowner whom Sunray Marine believed to be competent to perform it. The liability of Sunray Marine is personal and not vicarious for the shipowner (see p 919G).
So in our judgment, on the evidence such as it was, Ang would most likely have succeeded in his claim against Sunray Marine. Since Sunray Marine had as a matter of practicality relied on the shipowner to provide Ang with a safe system of work, although the legal duty was Sunray Marine`s, and the shipowner having failed to do so, should Sunray Marine be indemnified by the shipowner for Sunray Marine`s liability to pay Ang damages for which Sunray Marine now seeks a declaration?
Sunray Marine may have acted tardily in not responding to Ang`s solicitors to file the defence but in the event a judgment in default of defence being entered against Sunray Marine has not prejudiced the shipowner. There is evidence on record that the parties were in correspondence soon after the explosion in 1992 and the parties already anticipated potential claims so much so that on 20 June 1992, Boustead Services Pte Ltd on behalf of Britannia Steamship Insurance Associated Ltd, the protection and indemnity club to which the Lotus M belonged by a letter of guarantee agreed to indemnify Sunray Marine of all claims arising out of the explosion.
Accordingly we see no reason why Sunray Marine should be deprived of the remedy of the declaration sought. The declaration will be that Sunray Marine is entitled to be indemnified by the shipowner in respect of the damages, interest and costs assessed to be paid by Sunray Marine to Ang in DC Suit No 5083/94.
We, therefore, allow this appeal with costs here and one-third of the costs below of which Sunray Marine was deprived.

After an unnecessarily protracted trial of 107 days spanning two whole years, the respondent was acquitted of the two charges which follow: 
 
You, Kalpanath Singh s/o Ramraj Singh, male, 47 years old, NRIC No 1116101/D, are charged that you, on or about 18 September 1987, at No 101A, Upper Cross Street, #12-17, People`s Park Centre, Singapore, did cheat one Madam Lee Sim Yow by deceiving her into believing that a sum of $5,000 was required to be paid into court as a deposit in S 2425/87 and thereby dishonestly induced the said Lee Sim Yow to deliver a sum of $5,000 to you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
[And] 
 
You, Kalpanath Singh s/o Ramraj Singh, male, 47 years old, NRIC No 1116101/D, are charged that you, on or about 21 January 1988, at No 101A, Upper Cross St, #12-17, People`s Park Centre, Singapore, did attempt to cheat one Madam Lee Sim Yow by deceiving her into believing that a sum of $5,000 was required to be paid into court as a deposit in S 2425/87 and thereby dishonestly induced the said Lee Sim Yow to deliver a sum of $5,000 to you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 read with s 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The prosecution appealed against his acquittal. After hearing detailed submissions from both sides which lasted two and a half days, I allowed the appeal on both charges. I now give my reasons for doing so.
 The prosecution case
Sometime in December 1986, a company known as Gillman Video & Trading Pte Ltd (Gillman) was incorporated to carry on the business of renting out video tapes to members of the public. Lee Sim Yow (Lee), a director and shareholder of Gillman, was the main force behind the business. Tiew Siew Chye (Tiew), the other director and shareholder, was a sleeping partner in the venture. At that time, the licensed distributor of video tapes of popular Hong Kong television serials and films in Singapore was a company called Crown Video (S) Pte Ltd (Crown Video). Crown Video offered to enter into a contract with Gillman by which Gillman, as a sub-licensee, would be supplied with video tapes of Crown Video origin for its business. Unhappy with some of the proposed terms and conditions, Lee refused the offer. Instead, she purchased video tapes from some other sources, including a company known as Jomac Marketing Pte Ltd (Jomac) to carry on her business.
Consequently, Television Broadcasts Ltd, HK-TVB International Ltd and Crown Video (the plaintiffs) commenced an action in the High Court, namely, S 2425/87, against Gillman for infringement of copyright. On 14 September 1987, the plaintiffs obtained an ex parte interim injunction (the first injunction) against Gillman. In the afternoon of 17 September 1987, representatives of the plaintiffs raided Gillman`s premises and seized many video tapes. Lee rang up her husband, Roger Yeo Kong (Yeo), then a senior police officer, to inform him of the raid. Shortly after, Yeo arrived at the scene. He contacted an old friend, one MS Retnam (Retnam), now deceased, for advice. Retnam was an advocate and solicitor whom the couple had previously instructed on two matters, namely, the incorporation of Gillman and the transfer of some shares. Upon Retnam`s recommendation, the couple decided to consult the respondent, an advocate and solicitor practising in the firm of Kalpanath & Co.
At about 5pm on the same day, the couple called at the respondent`s office at People`s Park Centre. They were met at the reception area by Retnam who introduced them to the respondent. Lee handed the papers relating to the first injunction to the respondent. After looking at them, the respondent assured Lee that she had a strong case and need not worry at all. He promised he would get the injunction lifted within a few days` time. Her seized tapes would also be returned. Then, they discussed the legal fees involved. The respondent said he would charge Lee `$1,000 plus` for his work. When Lee pressed him to be more specific, the respondent clarified that he meant not more than $1,500 and not less than $1,000 for the entire case. Lee was agreeable to this.
The respondent wanted Lee`s written authorization for him to act in the matter. He produced two copies of a standard form used in his office called the warrant to act and asked Lee to complete them. The copy adduced as evidence is substantially reproduced, with the handwritten portions set in parentheses, as follows: 
 
Warrant to act
 
 
 
Re: [S 2425/87]
 
 
 
I/We [0258290B Lee Sim Yow] of [Gillman Video & Trading Pte Ltd] hereby authorize M/s Kalpanath & Co, Advocates & Solicitors, ... to act for me/us in respect of the above matter ...
 
 
 
And it is hereby agreed that: 
 
(a) the non-refundable retainer now payable by me/us is [$5,000 total fee for the whole case. No further charges. Initialled].
(b) ... 
(c) ...
 
 
 
Dated this [17] day of [09] 19[87]
 
 
 
Signature: [Signed]
 
 
 
Witness: [Signed]
 
 
 
Lee filled in the necessary particulars in the top portion of both copies of the warrant to act. She asked the respondent how much she had to pay him upfront as the non-refundable retainer. He assured her that she would have to pay him only when the case was over. After signing and dating the two copies, she returned them to the respondent. At that time, the endorsement and the initial against item (a) were not on either of the copies. They were added subsequently without her knowledge and consent.
Just as the couple was about to leave the office, the respondent told Lee that a sum of $5,000 was required as a refundable deposit to be placed with the court in respect of the case. In fact, the sum of money was needed urgently. Shocked by the news, Lee turned around to check with Yeo if there was indeed such a requirement. Yeo was unable to assist because he was not at all familiar with court procedure in civil matters. The respondent assured them that the money would be returned at the end of the case.
Not having $5,000 to spare, Lee and Yeo decided to approach a family friend, one Yap Leong Chye (Yap) to borrow the money. As a shareholder of Jomac, Yap was also in the video-letting trade. Yap was told that they needed $5,000 urgently as a deposit to be placed in court. On the morning of 18 September 1987, Yap gave them $5,000 cash. Later in the same morning, Lee visited the respondent at his office and handed him a cheque for $5,000 dated 17 September 1987. Lee did not receive a receipt from the respondent to acknowledge the payment.
On 26 September 1987, Lee called at the respondent`s office where she was introduced to one Mahendran Mylvaganam (Mahendran), a legal assistant in the firm. Mahendran took a statement from her. On 15 October 1987, she was summoned to see the respondent urgently. It transpired that Mahendran had left the respondent`s firm without notice and the respondent needed more information from her. The information was necessary for the respondent to prepare an affidavit in compliance with the first injunction. This time, Lee was brought to see one Khalid bin Abdullah (Khalid), the clerk at the firm, to whom she gave another statement.
On 16 October 1987, Lee went to the respondent`s office to affirm the affidavit prepared on her behalf. Despite her requests to accompany the respondent to all court hearings, Lee was not informed of any pending. In fact, 16 October 1987 was the return date of the first injunction. Unknown to her, and without any instructions from her, Ravindran Kumaran (Ravindran), another one of the respondent`s legal assistants, appeared in court on 16 October 1987 and consented to the continuation of the first injunction until the trial of the action. The consent order was not served on Lee.
Contrary to the respondent`s promise, the video tapes were not returned quickly. This was of grave concern to Lee who had many customers demanding for the video tapes. However, sometime in late September or early October 1987, the respondent told Lee that the first injunction had been lifted and that Lee could resume her business. In turn, Lee informed her clerk one Foo Bee Kheng (Foo) of the good news. Business continued as before. However, on 11 January 1988, a second raid was conducted by the plaintiffs on Gillman`s premises. The respondent could not be reached at his office. Instead, Ravindran spoke to Lee over the telephone and advised her to let the raiding party seize the video tapes pursuant to the second injunction of court (the second injunction).
Accompanied by Yeo, Lee met the respondent at his office on 18 January 1988. She demanded for an explanation why her shop was raided for a second time. The respondent explained that the plaintiffs must have made a mistake and promised that he would resolve the matter. He added that a further sum of $5,000 was required as a refundable court deposit because this was a separate injunction from the first. Lee was upset to hear the news.
On 21 January 1988, Lee finally raised the required sum of money and prepared a cheque of $5,000 which she handed to the respondent. She was told by the respondent that the case would be heard on 6 February 1988. Later in the same day, Yeo rang to say that Yap, whose video library had also been raided, said that there was no such thing as a court deposit. Lee contacted Yap who repeated what he had already told Yeo. Her suspicions aroused, Lee called up the subordinate courts and discovered that her case was not due to be heard on 6 February 1988. In the end, Lee turned to her old friend John Fong Chee Yang (John Fong), an advocate and solicitor with the firm of Cheng, Fong & Tan, for advice. She told John Fong a little about her case. When John Fong confirmed there was no such thing as a court deposit, Lee realized she had been deceived. Immediately, she contacted her bank to stop payment on the cheque.
On 22 January 1988, Lee consulted John Fong with the papers relating to the second injunction. Lee told John Fong that the respondent had cheated her. John Fong advised her not to rent out any more video tapes. Also, she was told not to speak to the respondent. He added that he had a case at the moment but would look into her matter in March.
Subsequently, the respondent called Lee to ask her why the cheque had bounced. Heeding John Fong`s advice, she simply said that she would check with the bank. A few days later, he called again to ask why she had decided to change lawyers. Unable to contain herself, she scolded him for being dishonest and for deceiving her. He apologized and told her that he would return her the money. He added `no offence`. Lee told John Fong of the exchange.
On 8 April 1988, when she next saw John Fong, he asked her why she had consented to the continuation of the first injunction. Lee was very angry to learn of this and complained to John Fong that the respondent had acted without her consent. On 19 April 1988, she saw John Fong again. She complained that the sum of $5,000 had not been returned in spite of the respondent`s promise to do so. John Fong advised her to write a simple letter to ask for a receipt and a bill of costs. On 21 April 1988, Lee wrote the following letter:

After waiting in vain for almost two months for the return of her money, Lee wrote again on 13 July 1988, stating:

On 16 July 1988, Lee received a letter enclosing a cheque for $705.50. In the letter, the respondent explained that he had deducted from the sum of $5,000, a sum of $3,000 as his fees for work done on the injunction matter and a sum of $1,294.50 for handling the transfer of the shares. The transfer of the shares and the incorporation of Gillman were originally matters entrusted to Retnam who had subsequently transferred them to the respondent.
Meanwhile, Lee complained to the Law Society on 19 May 1988 about the respondent`s misconduct. In the detailed letter of complaint to the Law Society, Lee said that the $5,000 `was for the courts and not for legal fee.` As for the second $5,000, Lee said that she paid the money `for the courts to take up the case.` When she received the partial refund of only $705.50, she was so furious that she lodged a police report on 22 July 1988. In the police report, she repeated that the first $5,000 was a `deposite [sic] for the courts to take up the case.` She did not mention the second $5,000.
One Inspector Oh Hwee Kiong (Insp Oh) attended to Lee at the police station on 22 July 1988. Acting on the police report, Insp Oh visited the respondent at his office on the same day. He made copies of the two letters dated 13 July 1988 and 16 July 1988, a receipt for the first cheque and a photocopy of the cheque of $705.50. These were all found in the client`s file. Insp Oh said he was guided to these four documents by the respondent. On 12 August 1998, Inspector Jeffrey Toh (Insp Toh) took over the investigation from Insp Oh. The respondent was asked to furnish all the relevant documents that would help his case. One of the documents seized on 13 August 1988 was the warrant to act.
On 15 August 1988, the respondent received a notice from the inquiry committee enclosing a copy of the complaint by Lee. On the same day, the respondent called Lee a number of times, asking her why she had reported the matter to the police. Once again, he promised to return her the money. Lee asked the respondent to send the money to John Fong. Then, she rang John Fong to ask him to expect a cheque.
On 16 August 1988, the respondent again pestered Lee with his calls. Lee had instructed Foo to screen her calls. Somehow, the respondent succeeded in reaching Lee and repeated his promise to return her the money. It was apparent to Lee that the respondent had not returned the money as he had promised the day before. Exasperated with his empty promises, she told John Fong not to accept any cheque from the respondent. At about 4.30pm, she received another call from the respondent who said that he was coming to see her at her office. He pleaded for five to ten minutes of her time and she relented. The respondent came with Khalid. The latter remained outside her office while the respondent spoke with her alone. The respondent showed her the files pertaining to the transfer of the shares and to Gillman`s incorporation. He insisted that he had done a lot of work for her in the various matters. The respondent promised to return her $5,000 and asked her to write to the Law Society to withdraw her complaint. When the respondent realized that she would not listen to him, he turned to leave. At the door, he asked her where her copy of the warrant to act was. She replied in anger that she had thrown it away. All she really wanted then was for him to leave. The respondent smiled when he heard that and left. After the unpleasant encounter, Lee told Foo that the respondent had cheated her of her money and was trying to persuade her to settle matters peaceably.
On 17 August 1988, Insp Toh interviewed Lee. Further statements were taken on 18 and 19 August 1988. When Insp Toh showed her the warrant to act, it dawned upon her that this was what the respondent was referring to on 16 August 1988. She confirmed that she was never given a copy of it.

On 24 August 1988, Assistant Superintendent Sugumaran Bala (ASP Bala) from the Commercial Crime Division took over the case. On 25 August 1988, ASP Bala seized the client`s file. In one of his interviews with Lee in May 1989, ASP Bala was handed an accounts book by Lee in which she recorded all moneys going into and out of her account. She referred to it as the cash book. ASP Bala noticed two material entries in the cash book. The first entry dated 18 September 1987 described the sum of $5,000 paid to Kalpanath & Co as a sum `To court as deposit`. The entry dated 21 January 1988 described the second payment to Kalpanath & Co as a payment `For court injunction`. ASP Bala marked out these two entries and made copies of the same. He returned the cash book to Lee because she needed it for audit purposes. He seized the cash book on 26 May 1989.
The bookkeeper of Gillman, Kng Siew Hua (Kng) noticed the two entries in June or July 1988. Initially, she had classified the September entry of $5,000 as legal fees and posted it accordingly to the general ledger and the trial balance as she was under the impression that whatever payment to the court or to a lawyer should be so classified. Subsequently, the auditor of Gillman, one Yong Cherng Nan (Yong) requested for a bill or receipt in respect of this sum of $5,000. As such, Kng produced the respondent`s letter on 27 May 1988, acknowledging receipt of $5,000. Kng also told Yong that Lee had been cheated by the respondent and that the sum of $5,000 could be recovered. As a result, Yong was of the view that the $5,000 should not be classified as legal fee and therefore made a reverse entry of this sum into the directors` account. The sum was also reflected in the balance sheet as part of the sum owing by the directors. Finally, a third entry in the cash book described the refund of $705.50 as `Return loan of $5,000`. Such were the essential aspects of the prosecution case.
 The defence case
In essence, the respondent denied that he dishonestly misrepresented to Lee that the two sums of $5,000 were required as deposits for the court. The two sums of $5,000 were meant as agreed legal costs or fees. To elaborate, on 17 September 1987, the respondent met Lee for the first time when she came alone to his office. Retnam was not in the office that day. At first, he asked Lee for a retainer of $1,500 and said that he would bill her as and when work was done. However, she requested for a global fee. They agreed at a fee of $5,000. He then asked her to sign the warrant to act. After looking through it, she said she needed to consult the other director of Gillman. Presumably, she was referring to Tiew. She left with a copy of the warrant to act and said that she would let him know the outcome the next day.
The next morning, Lee called at his office again. At this meeting, Lee handed him the cheque for $5,000. In return, he signed a payment voucher from Gillman which Lee produced. The warrant to act had already been signed by Lee and dated 17 September 1987. Pursuant to Lee`s request, he added the endorsement and his initial. A photocopy of the warrant to act was given to Lee. He told her that one of his legal assistants, Mahendran, would be handling the matter and then introduced her to him.
In respect of these two meetings with Lee, the respondent kept short attendance notes on a single sheet of paper (the attendance note) which read: 
 
17 September 1987
 
 
 
Mdm Lee came to office, re S 2425/87.
 
 
 
Enquired about costs of whole proceeding, including disbursement.
 
 
 
She wanted to consult other members of company before deciding.
Request to take warrant to act back and to send it to me duly signed with cheque if the others agree. 
 
18 September 1987
 
 
 
Mdm Lee came to office, handed over warrant to act duly signed and cheque. Endorsed on warrant as requested by Mdm Lee that $5,000 fee for the whole case and no further charges.
 
 
 
Referred Mdm Lee to Mahendran. 
 
Initialled KS
 
 
 
These notes were only written after the second meeting on 18 September 1988.
As for the cheque, he handed it to the accounts clerk, Jackie Tan Kiok Boon (Jackie), with instructions to deposit the amount into the office account as it was paid to the firm as his legal fees. The usual practice of the firm was to issue a receipt straightaway whenever a cheque was received by the firm. The original receipt would be sent to the client upon clearance of the cheque. The duplicate of the receipt kept by the firm in the receipt book stated that the amount of $5,000 was for `costs`. As for the client`s file, Khalid said that he opened it on 18 or 19 September 1987. At that time, he saw both the warrant to act and the attendance note in it.
Mahendran had conduct of the case until 7 October 1987. On 22 September 1987, Mahendran filed a memorandum of appearance to the action. On 2 October 1987, Mahendran had a very busy schedule. As such, he asked Ravindran to appear before Lai Kew Chai J to seek an extension of time for Lee to file an affidavit in compliance with the first injunction. Ravindran perused the client`s file prior to his appearance before Lai Kew Chai J. In doing so, he noticed the warrant to act and the attendance note. He remembered the endorsement on the warrant to act because he was surprised that the respondent was only going to charge $5,000 for an injunction matter. As it turned out, Lai Kew Chai J wanted Mahendran to attend personally before him. Later in the same day, Mahendran successfully obtained an extension of a week for Lee to file her affidavit.
The following letter was sent to Lee on 2 October 1987: 
 
Gillman ...
 
 
 
2 October 1987
 
 
 
Attention: Ms Lee Sim Yow
 
 
 
Dear Sirs,
 
 
 
S 2425/87
 
 
 
We refer to the above captioned matter in which our Mr Mahendran appeared in court today and made an application for extension of time to comply with the order of Court dated 14 September 1987. We also refer to the telephone conversation between Ms Lim [sic] Sim Yow and our Mr Mahendran today.
 
 
 
Would be obliged if you could furnish all documents ...
The return date of the injunction is 16 October 1987 ...

Mahendran said it was his habit to keep his clients fully informed at all times of the progress of their cases. He could not remember for certain if the letter was written by him. It was how he would have affixed the firm`s signature at the end of the letter and the style of writing in the letter was similar to his. Therefore, it was probable that the letter was written by him. He could have sent the letter to Lee at the end of the day. On 7 October 1987, he left the firm without notice because he was very unhappy with the respondent.
On 8 October 1987, the respondent asked to see Lee urgently because of Mahendran`s hasty departure. He interviewed Lee at some length. He also referred her to Khalid who was to collate all the necessary information in order to prepare an affidavit. On 9 October 1987, the respondent explained to Lee the difficulty of lifting the injunction. She accepted his opinion. All she wanted was time to effect a settlement with the plaintiffs. On 16 October 1987, Lee read the affidavit prepared by Khalid and then affirmed it. There was a hearing in court regarding the matter that day. Ravindran who was to attend the hearing asked Lee if it was her intention to comply with the first injunction. She nodded her head. As such, the respondent warned Lee not to deal with the offending video tapes and to surrender the same. Unfortunately, a copy of the consent order was not served on Lee because Ravindran went on holiday shortly after. In the first week of November, instructions were obtained from Lee with a view to file a defence. The defence was filed on 7 November 1987.
In early January 1988, the respondent was away in England. He returned on 14 January 1988. On 18 January 1988, Lee came alone to see him about the second raid. Sarban Singh (Sarban), a legal assistant, was with him when Lee arrived. Lee showed the respondent the papers pertaining to the second injunction. He said he was aware of the raid because he had received a letter dated 13 January 1988 from the solicitors of the plaintiffs. Lee explained that she had continued to deal with the video tapes because they were in great demand. She did not expect a second raid. The respondent warned her that committal proceedings might be brought against her by the plaintiffs if she were to continue to flout the court orders. He also advised her that she had to file an affidavit within seven days in compliance with the second injunction. Lee asked the respondent to handle the matter. He told her that a further $5,000 was required as his legal fees because there was a lot more work to be done. She told him she would contact him after consulting her fellow director.
On 22 January 1988, Lee handed the respondent a cheque of $5,000 with a request to proceed with the matter as they had discussed. He urged her to bring the invoices and receipts quickly and reminded her that the time for filing an affidavit had lapsed. In the normal course of things, the respondent handed the cheque to Jackie who issued a receipt and banked in the cheque. On 25 January 1988, the respondent found out that payment on the cheque had been stopped. When he asked Lee why she had stopped payment on the cheque, she replied that she had found another solicitor who was prepared to fight her case for a lesser sum. She mentioned a fee of $2,000 and asked if he was prepared to do the same. The respondent declined. The receipt stating that the amount was for `costs` was cancelled.
On 27 January 1988, the respondent received a letter from John Fong asking for the relevant documents. The respondent handed the client`s file together with John Fong`s letter to Sarban with instructions to forward all the necessary documents to John Fong. Sarban said he saw the attendance note and the warrant to act in the client`s file. He noticed some handwriting on the warrant to act as he was `flipping` through the client`s file. He did not read the handwriting carefully. Eventually, on 22 February 1988, the relevant documents were forwarded to John Fong. During this period, Lee called the respondent up a few times to ask how much of the $5,000 he was returning to her, bearing in mind that $5,000 was the global fee for the entire case. He told her that he would let her know after working out his legal fees. Lee`s demands over the telephone were followed by the letters on 21 April 1988 and 13 July 1988. Sarban replied on behalf of the firm on 26 May 1988 and 16 July 1988.
Of Insp Oh`s visit on 22 July 1988, the respondent said that he passed the entire client`s file to Insp Oh. It was up to Insp Oh to get the documents he wanted. Insp Oh did not take either the warrant to act or the attendance note. Touching on his visit to Lee`s shop premises on 16 August 1988, the respondent explained that he had asked her to collect the amended memorandum and articles of association for Gillman from his office. However, she had no time to do so. Khalid agreed to take the documents to her shop. Before Khalid left the office, Lee rang up to ask if the amendments in the documents had been initialled by the respondent because she needed the documents for the auditors by the next day. The respondent had not done so. Out of a sense of duty to Lee, the respondent made the trip to her office with Khalid to initial the amendments in the documents. As they were leaving her office, Lee accused the respondent of cheating her. He told her to look at the warrant to act to draw her attention to the agreed fee of $5,000. She replied that she had thrown it away. After that, they left. The respondent denied making persistent telephone calls to Lee from the 15 to 18 August 1988. He also denied that he offered to return her $5,000.
On these facts, the respondent was brought before a disciplinary committee in June 1989 on four charges. The record of the proceedings before the disciplinary committee was introduced as evidence at the trial by the respondent. With that, I conclude the defence evidence.
 The trial judge`s decision
In the main, the trial judge found that he could not accept Lee`s evidence because she was an unreliable witness whose evidence was fraught with inconsistencies and contradictions. He observed that there were many attempts to impeach the credit of Lee. While he did not find her credit to be successfully impeached, he said in his grounds of decision, at p 64: 
 
From PW2`s [Lee`s] demeanour in court - when on several occasions she either did not answer questions put to her not even after the questions were repeated, the numerous occasions when she took a long time to answer questions put to her - she certainly cannot be said to be a reliable witness. No doubt PW2 was subjected to a very long and arduous cross-examination by defence and this was certainly taken into consideration by the court in assessing the inconsistencies and/or contradictions in her testimony.
 
 
 
The trial judge also relied heavily on John Fong`s evidence to show that Lee was not a credible witness. Further, he found that Lee`s version of the events was not supported by Yeo, the other prosecution witnesses or the relevant documents. Turning to the respondent`s defence, the trial judge noted that there were several unsatisfactory features both in the respondent`s evidence as well as in the evidence of the defence witnesses. Also, the documents in support of the defence were suspicious. Therefore, the trial judge did not go as far as to accept the respondent`s defence. However, he did not find that the prosecution had proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. He applied the following passage in where Suffian J, as he then was, said at p 263: 
 
If you accept the explanation given by or on behalf of the accused, you must of course acquit. But this does not entitle you to convict if you do not believe that explanation, for he is still entitled to an acquittal if it raises in your mind a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, as the onus of proving his guilt lies throughout on the prosecution. If upon the whole evidence you are left in a real state of doubt, the prosecution has failed to satisfy the onus of proof which lies upon it.
 
 
 
In the premises, he acquitted the respondent on both charges.
 The appeal
I begin with a preliminary question of law raised by counsel for the respondent that the two charges preferred against the respondent are defective in law. The particulars of the two charges are that the respondent cheated and attempted to cheat Lee, thereby dishonestly inducing Lee to deliver money to the respondent. At all material times, Gillman was a separate legal entity from Lee who was its shareholder and director. On the undisputed facts, the money belonged to Gillman because cheques of Gillman`s account with the Overseas Union Bank were used to pay the respondent. Moreover, the money was paid in respect of an action in which the defendant was Gillman. The respondent sent all correspondence to Gillman. In the premises, if the respondent had cheated at all, he cheated Gillman, the company, and not Lee. Counsel for the respondent relied on and . Counsel for the respondent further submitted that the defective charges prejudiced the respondent in the conduct of his defence. Crucial evidence was either lost or not produced because documents belonging to Gillman were not seized quickly.
The relevant sections in the Penal Code (Cap 224) state: 
 
Section 415
 
 
 
Whoever, by deceiving 
 any
 person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver 
 any
 property to 
 any
person, or to consent that 
 any
person shall retain 
 any
property, ... is said to `cheat`. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Section 420
 
 
 
Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver 
 any
property to 
 any
person ... shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years ... . [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Reverting to the present charges, the prosecution case rested on the key allegations that the respondent deceived 
 Lee 
, by dishonestly misrepresenting to her twice that money was needed as court deposits for legal proceedings, thus dishonestly inducing her to deliver two sums of money to the respondent. I appreciated that Gillman and Lee were two separate and distinct legal entities. I also agreed with the concept expounded in the cases of 
 A-G`s Reference (No 2 of 1982) 
 and that directors and shareholders in control of their companies are capable in law of misappropriating company property. However, it was quite irrelevant in the two charges before me whether Gillman, as a separate legal entity, was perhaps also cheated by the respondent. The allegations as contained within the charges, if proved, would constitute all the necessary elements of the offences of the cheating and the attempted cheating of by the respondent.
Turning to the question of the ownership of the money, I was prepared to accept that the money belonged to Gillman. Nevertheless, on a plain reading of the statutory provisions, there is no requirement that the person cheated must own the property involved: `any property` suffices. In contrast and for the sake of illustration, the equivalent English offence within s 15(1) of the Theft Act 1968 is as follows: 
 
A person who by any deception dishonestly obtains property 
 belonging to another,
with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it, shall on conviction ... . [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The ambit of the English offence is restricted by the phrase `belonging to another`. Even then, an expansive interpretation of `belonging to another` is provided by s 5 of the Theft Act 1968 which states: 
 
(1) Property shall be regarded as belonging to any person having possession or control of it, or having in it any proprietary right or interest ... .
 
 
 
It is misconceived to contend that the scope of the cheating or deception offence within our provisions is restricted by a condition that the ownership of the property must vest in the person so cheated or deceived. Therefore, it was immaterial that the money belonged to Gillman. In the premises, I found that full particulars had already been set out in the two charges which were not in any way defective.
In addition, I was of the firm view that the respondent suffered no prejudice whatsoever even if the charges were defective as contended. At all times, the respondent was well aware of Lee`s allegations against him. He also knew of the existence of Gillman. In all the circumstances, there would be no material difference to the conduct of the defence. The arguments were totally devoid of merit and I dismissed them.
With that, I turn to the prosecution`s appeal based solely on facts. The prosecution contended that the acquittal of the respondent by the trial judge was against the weight of the evidence and wrong. There was overwhelming prosecution evidence, both oral and documentary, in support of the prosecution case. In addition, it was submitted that the respondent`s lies and suspicious conduct were corroborative of the prosecution case. I was asked to reassess the weight to be accorded to the various aspects of the case observed by the trial judge and recorded in his grounds of decision. Further, I was asked to consider the import of the other evidence in the case. In doing so, I was reminded of the uncontroversial principle that I had to give due regard to the trial judge`s findings of fact based on the credibility of the witnesses. In reply, counsel for the respondent submitted that the trial judge`s findings were perfectly justified on the totality of the evidence. I now highlight the relevant evidence which I considered after hearing submissions from both parties.
 Lee`s evidence
Lee, the main prosecution witness, was on the witness stand for a total of 33 days from August 1992 to February 1993. For 28 of those days, she was subjected to determined and arduous cross-examination by an experienced lawyer. From the outset, I state that there were some lies, many inconsistencies and contradictions in her evidence. Most of these discrepancies arose when her evidence at trial was compared to her evidence before the disciplinary committee in June 1989. There were also numerous awkward pauses in the course of her evidence at trial.
In this connection, I reiterate what I said in , at p 263: 
 
As with so many cases, where the lapse of time has caused memories to blur and fade, and result in throwing up many discrepancies in evidence, it is vitally important that courts do not lose sight of the wood for the trees. District judges and magistrates, especially, would be well advised to sit back sometimes, and decide what the essentials of the case are and in fact what the case is all about.
 
 
 
Furthermore, even if Lee was not the most reliable of witnesses and was evasive at times, it is trite law that if a witness had lied on one or two points it does not necessarily follow that his whole evidence should be rejected. It is the duty of the court to sieve the evidence and to ascertain what are the parts of the evidence tending to incriminate the accused which could be accepted: see at p 63. In the words of Thomson CJ in , at p 107: 
 
If a witness demonstrably tells lies on one or two points then it is clear that he is not a reliable witness and as a matter of prudence the rest of his evidence must be scrutinized with great care and indeed with suspicion. To say, however, that because a witness has been proved a liar on one or two points then the whole of his evidence `must in law be rejected` is to go too far and is wrong.
 
 
 
Apart from the apparent contradictions between Lee`s evidence with that of John Fong to which I shall devote a later part of my grounds of judgment, I do not propose to embark on a detailed examination of the unsatisfactory aspects of Lee`s evidence. Only two main areas deserve a quick mention.
First, Lee had lied about Gillman`s paid-up capital. The Board of Film Censors would only approve of and issue a licence to a private limited company with a minimum paid-up capital of $100,000 to run a video library. To that end, Lee declared in her application to the Board of Film Censors that Gillman had a paid-up capital of $100,000. Before the disciplinary committee and at trial, she gave evidence to the same effect. In fact, this was false. She had deposited and then withdrawn the same sum of $50,000 twice into a bank account to create the impression that there was such a paid-up capital. The deception regarding the paid-up capital of Gillman started because Lee wanted a licence for her business. In my opinion, it was a deception on her part in a totally different context and was quite remote to the fundamental issues in question.
Secondly, Lee said at trial that she made a search for the warrant to act after the respondent had asked her for it on 16 August 1988. She could not find it. At that time, she did not know what she was looking for. On 17 August 1988, Insp Toh showed her the respondent`s copy of the warrant to act. She realized then what it was and told him she had never received a copy. After that, she did not search for it again because she was not given a copy. Before the disciplinary committee, Lee said that she was asked by counsel for the Law Society to look for the warrant to act and she made a further search for it. She also told the disciplinary committee that most probably she was given a copy but she had thrown it away.
Undoubtedly, Lee`s evidence in respect of an important document such as the warrant to act was significant. Her copy, if any, could have concluded the case one way or the other. After much deliberation, I was of the view that there was genuine uncertainty on her part only as to whether she was given a copy of the warrant to act. More importantly, it was her consistent evidence that the endorsement on the warrant to act was added without her knowledge. If Lee was dishonest and if indeed she had an endorsed copy in her possession, she would claim right from the beginning that she did not receive a copy of the warrant to act and adhere firmly to her story. At the latest, she should have taken that stand before the disciplinary committee after being shown the respondent`s copy of the endorsed warrant to act. She would not be at all keen to be asked to search for it. However, even before the disciplinary committee, she wavered on the question whether she was given a copy. By maintaining that she signed two copies, she was faced with the difficulty of explaining where the other copy was and what it contained. This difficulty she valiantly faced and, in fact, contradicted herself in the process. I did not place much weight on the inconsistencies which I thought was a result of her genuine confusion over whether she had a copy of the warrant to act, which she would have produced if she could, as shown by her attempts to search for it.
I have painstakingly reviewed Lee`s evidence both before the disciplinary committee and at the trial. Besides the two specific areas which I have just discussed, I have also considered the other inconsistencies and contradictions. I attributed the discrepancies in Lee`s evidence, many of which were as to the dates and details of events, to the sheer lapse of time not only between the incidents and the trial but also between the disciplinary proceedings and the trial. Adequate allowance must be accorded to the human fallibility in retention and recollection. It is also common to find varying accounts of the same incident by the same person. No one can describe the same thing exactly in the same way over and over again: see , at p 63-64. The close scrutiny of her evidence before the disciplinary committee and at trial to her detriment was completely unjustified. Also, I found from the record that many instances of her failure to answer questions were the direct result of the aggressive manner of the cross-examination.
In my opinion, although the trial judge gave some allowance to the fact that Lee was subjected to intense and protracted cross-examination, he failed to properly address his mind to the significance of the lies, inconsistencies and contradictions. I was of the view that these were merely minor discrepancies or discrepancies as to minor issues and did not undermine her evidence in respect of the key issues. In the material aspects of her evidence, Lee was consistent and straightforward. Her consistency was patent from the number of documents adduced as evidence. Moreover, the other prosecution witnesses corroborated her evidence. To the supporting evidence, I shall now refer.
 The supporting documents
I shall concentrate only on the main documents, beginning with the three entries in the cash book maintained by Lee which stated `to court as deposit`, `for court injunction` and `return of loan`. The trial judge decided not to attach any weight to these entries. He based his decision on two main grounds. First, he questioned if the cash book was tampered with. Secondly, the trial judge doubted if the entries meant what they stated.
Turning to the first ground, the late production of the cash book worried the trial judge. While it is true that the cash book was not tendered before the disciplinary committee in June 1989, the trial judge had ignored the clear evidence of ASP Bala in this respect. In an interview with Lee in May 1989, ASP Bala was handed the cash book. ASP Bala noticed the two material entries in the cash book. He marked out these two entries and made copies of the same. These copies have already been produced in court as evidence. Therefore, the non-production of the cash book before the disciplinary committee should not have worried the trial judge so.
The trial judge was also concerned about the evidence of Kng and Yong regarding the cash book. In cross-examination, Kng was asked specifically if there was any handwriting on the cover of the cash book in 1988 and 1989. She was uncertain but thought that probably the name of the company and the words `bank book` were on the cover of the cash book. In fact, there was no such handwriting on the cash book. Although she was uncertain as to this minute detail, she did not admit at any time that the cash book was different from the one she saw in 1988 or 1989, contrary to what the trial judge remarked in his grounds of decision, at p 54. In fact, she remembered the cash book kept by Lee well, especially the entries of the two sums of $5,000. As part of her bookkeeping duties, she would copy all the entries in the cash book into another book. She remembered doing so in respect of these entries. Also, she was familiar with the two entries because she had been questioned by Yong about the first one. She found out from Lee that she was involved in a `legal tussle` and had been cheated by a solicitor. She told the same to Yong. Kng`s evidence clearly showed that these entries were in the cash book in 1988 and 1989. As for Yong, he said he could not be certain if he saw the cash book. In this connection, I observed that Kng copied all the entries in the cash book into another book, except for the column reflecting the balance. The latter would then be handed to Yong. Therefore, Yong`s reservation can be appreciated. In fact, Yong gave evidence that he remembered the first entry because he had to decide how to classify it in the accounts of Gillman.
I did not believe that Lee took the pains to reproduce an entire accounts book just to fabricate evidence for the disciplinary committee and for the trial. If Lee did so, why was not the cash book actually tendered to the disciplinary committee in support of her case? I accepted that the cash book was the one kept by Lee in 1987 and 1988. Having examined the cash book myself, I did not see any sign of tampering with the particular entries. I appreciated that Lee lied when she insisted that these entries were contemporaneous with the issue of the cheques. It was naive to claim that there was strict contemporaneity of all the entries in the cash book. Usually, records of this nature are maintained at regular intervals at the convenience of the person in charge. However, the lack of strict contemporaneity did not lead irresistibly to the conclusion that the entries were fabricated. On the contrary, I was sure that if the entries were fabricated, they would tend to be less vague and more favourable to Lee`s case. I had no doubt the entries were genuine.
The question remained whether to attach any weight to such descriptions. In this connection, it was brought to my attention that Lee did not know why she used these specific words. The last entry, especially, did not make much sense. Lee explained that she wrote as she went along and did not give much thought to the distinction between court deposit and court injunction. In my judgment, the purport of the first entry was crystal clear. Simply, the money was for a court deposit. It is quite unreasonable to expect Lee to state that the money was 
 refundable 
. In addition, all the three entries showed that the money was never meant as legal fees. The ambiguities of the two later entries should not detract from the value of the entries to that extent. On the whole, much probative weight can be attached to these entries which, as Lee said, served as simple reminders to her in the course of her business.
Next, I turn to the two letters on 21 April 1988 and 13 July 1988, the letter of complaint and the police report. The trial judge emphasized the failure on Lee`s part to state certain material facts in these documents, such as the agreed fee and the respondent`s promise to return her the money. He thought it uncharacteristic of her to leave out such crucial facts. As such, he found that the documents did not support Lee`s version of the events. My general observation was that the trial judge had placed too high a burden on Lee in respect of all the documents she wrote just because she was fluent in English and had shown herself to be capable of making harsh complaints to the appropriate authorities.
In the letter on 21 April 1988, the sum of $5,000 was said to be a `deposite [sic] for my case...`. The second letter on 13 July 1988 demanded for `the refund of the $5,000`. The two letters, albeit lacking in details, were not inconsistent with Lee`s case. Although the requests in these letters for a bill of costs tended to undermine her claim that there was an agreed fee, I noted that it was her evidence that John Fong asked her to write to ask for a bill of costs. This was confirmed by John Fong. From these two letters, Lee expressed her expectation of a full refund of $5,000.
As for the letter of complaint, she made it clear that the $5,000 was for a deposit in court and not for legal fees. I did not see why it was an imperative to state that the money was for a 
 refundable 
 court deposit. As for the second sum of $5,000, it was said to be `for the courts to take up the case`. Furthermore, in this letter of complaint, she set out in detail her other grievances. In particular, she spoke of the respondent`s promise to secure the return of her video tapes, his advice to her to resume her business and his assurances that she had a good case.
It was true that she did not mention in any of these three documents that there was an agreed fee of between $1,000 to $1,500. Lee clarified that she did not mention it because it was an agreed fee and was not in issue. At that point in time, she was only concerned to recover the $5,000 from the respondent. When she finally received the respondent`s letter on 16 July 1988 stating that he had charged $3,000 for his work which was completely outside the range they had agreed upon, she was so furious that she lodged the police report in which she mentioned the agreed fee. I accepted the reasonable explanation put forth by Lee. Further, in the police report, the first sum of $5,000 was said to be a `deposite for the courts to take up the case`.
From the contents of these documents emanating from Lee, I found that Lee was consistent in all the fundamental aspects of her evidence. It was erroneous of the trial judge to criticize the lack of specific details without considering the overall effect of these documents.
 Yeo`s evidence
Yeo was the other major prosecution witness. He was subjected to cross-examination for 11 days. In particular, it was disputed that he was present at either the meeting on 17 September 1987 or the meeting on 18 January 1988. In this respect, Yeo said that his pocket book maintained at the relevant time to record his daily activities would have proved conclusively that he was present at both meetings. However, it had been destroyed. The trial judge drew an adverse inference against Yeo from this fact, especially since Yeo was a senior police officer who should have known the importance of the pocket book.
In this connection, the trial judge erred in that he did not consider ASP Bala`s evidence before drawing such an adverse inference. ASP Bala`s evidence was: 
 
On [29 August 1988] when I was recording a statement from PW3 [Yeo] I ascertained from him that he had made two entries in his pocket book of two visits he made to the accused`s office together with PW2. He volunteered to show me the pocket book. I told him to produce same.
 
 
 
I cannot recall the exact date. He came to see me again with the two pocket books which he handed to me and which I inspected. I confirmed on inspection that he had made the said two visits. I am unable to recall the exact words written in the pocket book. After I had inspected PW3 wanted to hand them to me for safekeeping but I told him I did not want them and hence he took them back.
In cross-examination, ASP Bala said that he did not make photocopies of the diary because he did not think they were important. He conceded that he was careless in his investigation but said that, if the pocket book had shown that Yeo was not at the meetings, he would have checked the matter. I also noted that before the disciplinary committee in June 1989, it was Yeo who mentioned the existence of his pocket book. He offered to produce it but was not asked to do so.
Certainly, there were some other inconsistencies and contradictions in Yeo`s evidence, especially as to the details of the meetings. What I have said regarding Lee`s evidence applies equally here. With the lapse of time, such discrepancies were inevitable. The criticisms of the unsatisfactory quality of his evidence were unfounded. Yeo`s evidence corroborated that of Lee`s particularly as to the purpose of the payments.
 Yap`s evidence
Yap`s evidence which was of paramount importance strengthened the prosecution case further. According to Yap, he had known Yeo and Lee for almost ten years. In the evening of the first raid, Yeo approached him for a loan of $5,000. Yeo said that the money was to be used as a deposit to be placed in court. Yap lent them the money which they eventually repaid in monthly instalments. On the second occasion, Yeo told him he required another $5,000 to be placed in court as a deposit. Yap expressed surprise. By then, his video library had also been raided. Thus, he told Yeo not to pay the money because there was no such thing.
At trial, Yap was portrayed as a businessman who was willing to bend the rules and disregard the strict letter of the law for his businesses. In fact, Yap advised Lee to falsify the paid-up capital of Gillman. He was quizzed at great length about his businesses. It was also emphasized that he was a close friend of the couple who often helped them, both financially and with advice.
I have reviewed the evidence of Yap carefully. To my mind, Yap was a witness who gave candid evidence, even in respect of his businesses which was of little relevance to the present case. Despite the lengthy cross-examination, Yap maintained that he was told that the two sums of money were required as court deposits. I accepted that he spoke the truth on this material aspect. Yap confirmed that, right from the very first day of the raid, Yeo said that the money was required as a court deposit. On that day, the respondent had just been retained by the couple for his professional expertise. The couple had entrusted him with their problem. At that early stage in their solicitor-client relationship, there was no conceivable reason to malign the respondent or to distort the truth. It could only be that Yeo was telling Yap the truth. Therefore, Yap`s evidence was strongly corroborative of the evidence of Lee and Yeo that the sums were asked for as court deposits. Unfortunately, Yap`s evidence was not taken into account by the trial judge.
 John Fong`s evidence
I come to John Fong`s evidence. A quick comparison of his evidence before the disciplinary committee and at trial is necessary to illustrate a clever attempt on his part to change the import of his evidence at trial from that before the disciplinary committee. Both before the disciplinary committee and at trial, John Fong said that on 21 January 1988, he received a call from Lee whom he had known for about 20 years. She told him about the raid. She also said that her lawyer had said that `$5,000 was required in court`. He replied that there was no such thing.
Dealing with his evidence before the disciplinary committee, John Fong said that the next day, Lee came to see him alone. At this meeting, Lee told John Fong about the 
 cheating 
 by the respondent of her $5,000. He said: 
 
She mentioned that: why must Kalpanath 
 cheat
 her of the $5,000; I told her `it`s very simple; just call up Mr Kalpanath and ask for the return of the money.`
 
 
 
Turning to their next meeting on 8 April 1988, he said: 
 
... when she came to see me... I told her of the consent interim injunction, she also asked me whether she has any recourse against M/s Kalpanath in regard to the $5,000. I told her to refer the whole matter to the Law Society ...
 
 
 
Moving on, to the meeting on 19 April 1988, he said: 
 
Then I told her whether she has 
 a receipt
; she said no. I told her that perhaps it would be best that she got 
 a receipt
... She said `not necessary` because she issued a company cheque for $5,000. I told her it would be best to get M/s Kalpanath & Co to acknowledge the receipt of $5,000 as proof of payment. I suggested to her that she write a simple but polite letter ... For the acknowledgement of the payment of $5,000 and also to add in his bill of costs. I told her not to write an `angry` or impolite letter. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Finally, he said that, on one occasion, Lee told him to expect a cheque of $5,000 from the respondent on her behalf. The very next day, she told him not to accept any cheque from the respondent.
In sharp contrast, his evidence at trial was as follows. Of the meeting of 22 January 1988, he said: 
 
She [Lee] said that the accused had 
 cheated
 her of $5,000 which she has given to him 
 as his fees.
 She said she wanted a total refund. I told her it was very simple and that she should just call accused and ask for the refund. I also told her that it would be fairly difficult to obtain the full $5,000 refund because accused had done some work for her.
 
 
 
His ambivalence emerged more clearly from these extracts of his cross-examination: 
 
Q: Right from the beginning up to the time you handed the file to Mr Lee Han Yang [counsel for the Law Society] had PW2 [Lee] expressed to you that the first $5,000 paid to Kalpanath & Co was a court deposit and that it was refundable?
A: She had never said that. 
Q: As a member of the bar had PW2 disclosed to you that it was a court deposit and refundable what would you advise her to do? 
A: I would have advised her to report the matter to the police as well as to the Law Society. 
Q: You never gave such advice as PW2 never made the representation to you? 
A: Yes. 
Q: In the telephone conversation when PW2 spoke to you could the $5,000 she spoke to you be possibly a deposit to be paid into the court? 
A: It is possible. 
Q: The following day when she spoke to you she did not say this? 
A: She did not. 
Q: The next day, ie 22 January 1988 when she met you she said she handed the $5,000 to accused as his fees? 
A: Yes. 
Q: By fees it would refer to the legal work done on the injunction matter? 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
On 8 April 1988, he apparently advised Lee that her recourse in respect of the respondent`s 
 negligence 
was to complain to the Law Society. On 19 April 1988, he told Lee to write `a simple but polite letter` to the respondent after she told him that she had received a 
 photocopy 
 of the receipt but not the original. So he asked her to write for the original receipt and for the bill of costs. Quite interestingly, he admitted that Lee had asked him to expect a cheque from the respondent and then countermanded her order. However, he also added that the incidents happened in April and not August 1988.
In all these instances, John Fong had seriously qualified his evidence before the disciplinary committee where the significance of his evidence was that Lee was unhappy with the respondent for cheating her by telling her that money was required as a court deposit. It was patent that at trial, he tried to imply that Lee was merely unhappy with the respondent`s negligent conduct of her case and for having to pay him $5,000 as legal fees. He also negated her evidence that she did not receive a receipt at all for the first $5,000 and that she spoke to him in 
 August 
 about the return of the money.
Faced with a witness like John Fong, it was possible for the prosecution by virtue of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) to do the following: 
 
Section 156
 
 
 
The court may, in its discretion, permit the person who calls a witness to put any questions to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party.
 
 
 
Section 157
 
 
 
The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways ..., with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him:
 
 
 
(a) by the evidence of persons who testify that they ... believe him to be unworthy of credit;
(b) by proof that the witness has been bribed ...; 
(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted; ... .
 
 
 
As observed by the trial judge, the prosecution failed either to seek leave to put questions to John Fong or to impeach his credit. In the event, the trial judge found that the attack by the prosecution on the evidence of their own witness lacked credence.
It was evidently a mistake on the part of the prosecution who sought only to rely on their submissions to repair the prosecution case. Nevertheless, it remained the duty of the trial judge to evaluate with care the evidence of John Fong. His full evidence at the disciplinary committee hearing was placed before the trial judge. It is open to a trial judge, having considered the circumstances of a case, to believe the evidence of any witness, so far as its essentials are concerned, without having to accept as true everything which that witness says: see 
 Haji Johari bin Haji 
 8. The trial judge failed to do so.
In my opinion, a review of John Fong`s evidence at trial showed a deliberate and subtle departure from his evidence before the disciplinary committee. John Fong had embellished his evidence at trial for reasons best known only to him alone. In the circumstances, his evidence should be treated with great caution. I was of the opinion that the apparent contradictions between his qualified evidence and that of Lee`s should not adversely affect the credibility of Lee nor the weight to be given to Lee`s evidence. On the contrary, both before the disciplinary committee and at trial, John Fong`s clear evidence was that Lee told him that the money was required as a court deposit on 21 January 1988. It was also his evidence that Lee told him that the respondent had promised to secure the return of her video tapes, that the respondent told her to resume her business and that she did not consent to the continuation of the first injunction. To that extent, I accepted his evidence which fortified the prosecution case.
 Foo`s evidence
To conclude my discussion of the prosecution case, I shall briefly touch upon the evidence of Foo. Foo confirmed that Lee told her that they could resume business because she had been advised by her lawyer to do so. Secondly, Foo confirmed that she was present on 16 August 1988 when the respondent and Khalid visited Gillman`s premises. Subsequently, Lee told her that the respondent had tried to persuade her to settle matters between them amicably. The unchallenged evidence of Foo, an independent witness, deserved some consideration because she supported the peripheral aspects of Lee`s evidence. Her evidence was not taken into account by the trial judge in his grounds of decision. With that, I now address the defence evidence.
 The respondent`s evidence
I found many dubious features in the respondent`s evidence. I shall only deal with two major areas. The first relates to the visit by the respondent to Gillman`s premises on 16 August 1988. Before the disciplinary committee and in his letter dated 20 September 1988 to Lee, the respondent said that the meeting was in the first week of August. At trial, the respondent conceded that the date of the visit was 16 August 1988. He then denied that he received the notice from the inquiry committee on 15 August 1988. He continued to deny this until the notice was produced in court and brought to his attention. The respondent explained that he went to Lee`s office, out of a sense of duty to a client, to initial the amendments in the memorandum and articles of association of Gillman.
I did not believe for a moment his version of the visit on 16 August 1988. On that day, the respondent was supposedly ill. He had produced a medical certificate to excuse himself from a court hearing. Yet, he went to visit Lee. It was highly unlikely that the respondent would oblige Lee by going to her office to initial against some amendments in the documents out of a sense of responsibility, especially since the relationship between them was strained by that stage. The respondent should also have realized that it was unwise to visit her at a time when he faced both disciplinary proceedings and criminal charges initiated by Lee. In all the circumstances, Lee`s version of the visit rang of the truth. I found that the real purpose of the visit was to persuade her to drop the charges against him and to retract her complaint to the Law Society. The visit was probably prompted by the notice from the inquiry committee which he received the day before. To my mind, the deliberate lies as to the date and purpose of the visit before the disciplinary committee and at trial pointed towards a guilty mind.
Also, the respondent lied about the documents Insp Oh took from the client`s file on 22 July 1988. Before the disciplinary committee, he said that copies of both the attendance note and the warrant to act had been requested by Insp Oh. Therefore, he furnished copies of the same to Insp Oh. The respondent was very certain about this. At trial, the documents Insp Oh seized were produced as exhibits. In fact, Insp Oh only made copies of two letters, a receipt and the cheque of $705.50. Faced with such incontrovertible evidence, the respondent said that he handed the entire file to Insp Oh who was at liberty to make copies of any documents he wished. He said he did not remember what documents Insp Oh took. Insp Oh agreed that he was given the entire client`s file. However, he also said that he was specifically guided to the four documents of which he made copies.
Once again, the lies in this respect were significant. Undeniably, it was important for the respondent to show that the two crucial documents were not fabricated. He tried to do this by proving that they existed as early as 22 July 1988. Instead, his lies were exposed. I drew an inference against the respondent for attempting to distort the true facts.
 The defence documents
In support of his claim that the money was given to him as his legal fees, the respondent relied on three main documents, namely, the warrant to act, the attendance note and the letter on 2 October 1987. All three documents were produced by the respondent suspiciously late. When Insp Oh visited the respondent on 22 July 1988, he took four documents from the client`s file, none of which was the attendance note or the warrant to act. The respondent did not highlight either to Insp Oh. He should have realized the importance of these documents to his defence. On 13 August 1988, he was given a second chance to forward these two documents when Insp Toh asked for all the relevant documents in support of the defence. Although the warrant to act was produced to Insp Toh, the attendance note was not. The latter was only found in the client`s file when ASP Bala seized it on 25 August 1988.
As for the letter, it emerged only at the trial; it was not even available before the disciplinary committee. The respondent said that in late August 1990, he asked his staff to `look after this master file` which was the office file. While doing so, one member of his staff found the letter. Indeed, it was a most fortuitous find. I observed that there were no other letters to Lee around that time regarding the conduct of the case. I also found it odd that the letter was a photocopy of the original whereas the majority of the documents in the master file were duplicate copies of documents made on thin blue-coloured paper. It seemed to me that the usual practice of the firm was to file away such duplicate copies of documents, not photocopies.
Next, I cast my attention to the substance of these documents. The short and sharp endorsement was conveniently in support of the respondent`s case. It was hastily written without an initial by Lee to signify her consent. Likewise, the attendance note set out matters directly pertinent to the defence. In contrast, details of the case itself and the respondent`s advice were not dealt with at all. Bearing in mind that the attendance note was made on 18 September 1987 when Lee had already given the respondent the cheque and the warrant to act, it was incredible that the respondent bothered to include details such as `request to take W/A back and to send it to me duly signed with cheque if the other agree`. The events on the 17 September 1987 were irrelevant as they had been superseded by the events on 18 September 1987. I also observed that although there were various other meetings between the respondent and Lee, no notes were kept of these other meetings. The letter purportedly written on 2 October 1987 by Mahendran again contained only information critical to the defence case, especially in the areas which were hotly disputed before the disciplinary committee. To put it mildly, I was disturbed by the contrived contents of all these documents.
In respect of the letter on 2 October 1987, I should also deal with Mahendran`s evidence. Mahendran was not certain if he dictated the letter. He admitted that it was in his style and the signature was his. The handwriting expert, Ng Gek Kwee (Ng), testified that Mahendran had signed the letter, based on the specimen of Mahendran`s signature provided. She admitted that it was easy to do a `cut-and-paste` job on a photocopy of a document. The trial judge found that, even if there was the distinct possibility of forging such a document, this possibility was not put to Ng by the prosecution. The trial judge also found that Mahendran had no reason to help the respondent by fabricating a document in the respondent`s favour, having parted with the respondent on bad terms.
In this connection, the trial judge had completely ignored Mahendran`s evidence before the disciplinary committee. The evidence of Mahendran at trial differed substantially from his evidence before the disciplinary committee. Before the disciplinary committee, he said that on 2 October 1987, he looked through the file before the hearing to seek an extension of time to file Lee`s affidavit. He was not looking particularly for the attendance note, but he was sure he did not see it. At trial, he said that he did not look through the file before the hearing. He did not know if the attendance note was present. He explained the discrepancy thus. Up to the time of the disciplinary hearing, he was only shown three documents, namely, the warrant to act, the attendance note of the respondent and his own attendance notes. These documents did not give a complete picture of what had happened. After being shown all the relevant documents by counsel for the defence, he realized that he had conduct of the case way before 2 October 1987. On 2 October, he did not have the file with him. Moreover, he did not peruse it again that day because he already knew what he had to do, having taken instructions from Lee personally. He also added that on 26 September 1987 when he met Lee to record her statement, he did not have the client`s file with him. He did not know whether on 26 September the attendance note was in the file.
I was unable to place any reliance on Mahendran`s evidence. The manner in which Mahendran gave evidence was a subtle attempt to give a different impression from his evidence before the disciplinary committee. I did not accept his explanation of his discrepancies. In the event, I viewed the authenticity of the letter with suspicion. Furthermore, if Mahendran was so busy on 2 October 1987, I did not believe he actually had time to speak to Lee and then to write to her. From all the surrounding circumstances, I inferred that Mahendran was merely supporting the respondent`s case.
By the above, I gave no weight to the three main documents. As for the receipts stating that the payments were for `Costs`, I need only say that the respondent could not and would not have described the payments as `court deposits`. The receipts were of little value.
 The other defence witnesses
Ravindran and Khalid gave evidence mainly to support the existence of the warrant to act and the attendance sheet. Having found the documents to be suspicious, I see no need to discuss their evidence further.
As for Sarban`s evidence, the trial judge relied on the finding of his credibility by Chan Sek Keong J, as he then was, in the High Court. The respondent had brought certiorari proceedings to quash the unfavourable determination by the disciplinary committee in relation to Lee`s complaint against the respondent. The respondent alleged bias on the part of the chairman of the disciplinary committee, the particulars being that the chairman had spoken privately to Sarban twice during the time of the disciplinary committee hearing. Chan Sek Keong J found the appearance of bias to be established and quashed the decision of the disciplinary committee. It was in the context of those two conversations between Sarban and the chairman that Chan Sek Keong J remarked in 
 Re Singh Kalpanath 
, at p 659: 
 
I find that Sarban Singh was on the whole, sincere in his desire to tell the court the truth as he saw it ... He was ready to admit that he might not have recounted all the words used in the conversation as he was more concerned with the substance of the conversation.
 
 
 
The trial judge`s reliance on this finding was wholly uncalled for. It must be immediately appreciated that the proceedings were totally different in nature and context. The trial judge should have exercised his mind independently to the credibility of the witness.
Sarban claimed to be present at the meeting on 18 January 1988. Having reviewed the totality of his evidence, I could not accept his version of the meeting on 18 January 1988. He also claimed to have seen the attendance note and the warrant to act in February 1988. Once again, I refer to my reservations about the documents in question. Specifically, I also found his evidence that he saw the endorsement on the warrant to act as he was `flipping` through the client`s file unbelievable. I placed no reliance on Sarban`s evidence.
 Conclusion
In the light of the foregoing, I found that the trial judge`s assessment of the totality of the prosecution evidence was erroneous. In my opinion, there was sufficient prosecution evidence, both oral and documentary, to prove beyond reasonable doubt the two charges against the respondent. As for the defence, I found it incredible and rejected it. From the deliberate and self-serving lies and the suspicious conduct of the respondent and his witnesses, I also inferred that there was a guilty mind on the part of the respondent. Accordingly I allowed the appeal and reversed the decision of the trial judge. After hearing the plea in mitigation submitted by counsel for the respondent, I decided that the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the case was 18 months` imprisonment on each charge. I ordered the sentences to be served consecutively. Finally, upon an application by the prosecution, I also awarded costs of prosecution pursuant to s 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), such costs to be agreed upon or taxed.

Background
The two appellants were both former police officers, attached to Ang Mo Kio police station. The first appellant (`Garmaz`) retired on 16 April 1993 while the second appellant (`Jaswinder`) resigned on 11 December 1993. Jaswinder was originally charged under s 29(a) read with s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed) (`PCA`) with abetting Garmaz in committing the offence of corruptly accepting a gratification of $2,000 on or about 6 July 1991, by intentionally arranging with one Barlly Tan Kim Hock (`Tan`) (PW1) to give the money to Garmaz through one Leong Kin Eng (`Leong`) (PW5). Garmaz was originally charged under s 6(a) of the PCA with having corruptly accepted from Tan, through Leong, a gratification of $2,000 as an inducement to recommend that no further action be taken on a case against Leong. Leong, who was also known as Christopher Leong, was then under investigation by Garmaz for an alleged offence of illegal moneylending and vandalism. A total of seven other charges were stood down by the prosecution. The appellants did not object to being tried jointly on the above two charges.
 The case for the prosecution
 
 
 
 (i) Barlly Tan`s evidence
 
Tan (PW1) gave evidence that he was asked by one Ang Chee Soon (`Ang`) (PW4) to help out one Ong Thian Lye (`Ong`), who had been arrested for suspected illegal moneylending on 4 July 1991. Tan knew Jaswinder, and made an appointment to meet him at the Blue Berry Lounge in Upper Thomson Road. According to Tan, five persons met at the Lounge - Jaswinder, Garmaz, Ang, Leong and Tan himself. Tan could not confirm when they met. After meeting, they went to the Green Lounge at United Square.
Tan testified that Jaswinder then called him one or two days later and asked whether Tan could help him borrow $2,000. Tan said he would try to help him but he did not. He claimed that he himself did not lend Jaswinder any money. This portion of his evidence contradicted para 15 of his statement which was recorded by SSI Sng Jin Poh (PW3). Paragraph 15 reads: 
 
On the second day, Jaswinder Singh paged for me. When I contacted him, he told me that he wanted to borrow $2,000 friendly loan from me. As I have mentioned, I treated Jaswinder Singh as my friend, therefore, I agreed to lend him the money. I then asked my worker Christopher to arrange with Jaswinder Singh for handing the $2,000 requested by Jaswinder Singh. Similarly, I did not know how Christopher Leong got the $2,000 - but he had been collecting debts for me, I presume he could have taken the money from the debts collected by him. As far as I remember, Jaswinder Singh has not repaid me his loan. I have not pressed him to repay me the loan since he is my friend. It is not important to me whether he will repay me the loan.
 
 
 
The DPP thus applied to treat Tan as a hostile witness. The court went on to admit Tan`s statement. No further material evidence was received from Tan. The district judge eventually ruled at the close of the prosecution`s case that Tan`s credit had been impeached.
 (ii) Ang`s evidence
Ang`s evidence is not really material. Consistent with Tan`s evidence, Ang said that he had asked for assistance in relation to Ong Thian Lye`s arrest. Ang also said that the meeting at the Blue Berry Lounge took place on 5 July 1991.
 (iii) Leong`s evidence
Leong was the main prosecution witness. Leong had been working for Tan since 1989. Tan was an illegal moneylender. Leong testified that he had been arrested and interrogated on 25 September 1990 in relation to a complaint of vandalism and illegal moneylending made by one Oh Kian Tiong. After rigorous interrogation, Jaswinder approached him and told him not to worry as they would know what to do. Jaswinder told him that his boss`s name should not be mentioned and that Garmaz was the Investigating Officer. Leong was later released on bail and was never charged with any offence.
Leong said that on 5 July 1991, he went to the Blue Berry Lounge upon Tan`s instructions. Leong confirmed that the five persons mentioned by Tan were all present there. Later they adjourned to another lounge. On 6 July 1991, Tan informed Leong to prepare $2,000 to be handed over to Jaswinder. Leong arranged to meet Jaswinder at the Blue Berry Lounge that night at about 8pm. Garmaz turned up instead. Leong was not prepared to hand the money to Garmaz, but agreed to do so after speaking to Jaswinder over the telephone. Garmaz suggested that, as there were too many people around, the transaction should be carried out at Yishun Seafood Restaurant. Upon arriving at Yishun Seafood Restaurant at about 9pm, Leong saw both Garmaz and Jaswinder there. He handed the money to Garmaz, who counted the money and put it in his shirt pocket. Garmaz then told him that his case had been `NOD`, an acronym meaning `no offence disclosed`. Leong understood this to mean that there would be no problem with his 1990 case in court.
In cross-examination, Leong said that he had never known about the $2,000 `settlement`. It was only on 6 July 1991 that Tan had asked him to bring $2,000 to see the two appellants. Only after the money had been paid did Leong know that his case had been finally settled. He said that his recollection of the date was based on the fact that on 4 July 1991, another colleague (Ong Thian Lye) was arrested in Sin Ming. Tan told him about this incident, and the following day (5 July 1991) he met the appellants at the Blue Berry Lounge. Leong was very sure that the money was handed over to the appellants on 6 July 1991.
 (iv) The evidence of R Vidhysagaran (`Ringo`) (PW6)
One of the arresting officers when both Leong and Ong were arrested in 1990 and 1991 respectively was Detective Station Inspector R Vidhysagaran, otherwise known as `Ringo`. Ringo gave evidence that he arrested Ong Thian Lye on 4 July 1991. The arrest report in respect of Ong Thian Lye filed by one Pang Ai Jee was produced.
Ringo said that on 9 July 1991, he was at the Green Lounge at United Square, having drinks with some colleagues. He happened to see Jaswinder who was standing with a male Chinese, who was introduced to him as Barlly (Tan). Ringo declined their invitation to join them for a drink. He saw Garmaz as well. He had not met both the appellants on any other occasion at the Green lounge. He wrote in his pocket book the date he was at the Green Lounge.
In cross-examination, Ringo confirmed that he had seen the appellants and Barlly on 9 July 1991. He could not say whether Leong was there.
 (v) The other evidence adduced by the prosecution
The prosecution also called Lee Nai Kong (`Lee`) (PW7), who was then Head Investigation, Ang Mo Kio police station. Lee produced the station duty rosters for September 1990 and July 1991. On 5 July 1991, both appellants were on 24-hour duty, which began at 6am on 5 July and ended at 6am the next day. The minute sheets relating to Leong`s case were produced. They showed that at the end of investigation, no further action was taken against Leong and the investigation papers were sent for filing. Lee identified the officer who wrote NFA (`No Further Action`) and CFF (`Case for Filing`) in the minutes as Chief Inspector II Rosli Magnus. These instructions were given upon Garmaz`s written recommendation.
The last witness for the prosecution was Rosli Magnus (`Rosli`) (PW8). Rosli was attached to Ang Mo Kio police station in 1991 as senior investigating officer. The investigation papers in respect of Leong were produced and Rosli was referred to the minutes recorded. He confirmed that he eventually accepted Garmaz`s recommendation that no further action be taken against Leong.
 (vi) The application to amend the charges
Before Rosli`s evidence was heard, the prosecution applied to amend the charges. The amended charges were tendered for consideration and submissions were heard only after Rosli`s evidence had been recorded. The proposed amendments would add an alternative charge against each appellant. The only difference from the original charges was that the alternative charges specified that the offence took place on 10 July 1991 and not 6 July 1991. The prosecution evidently felt that this was necessary because of the different dates cited by Leong and Ringo as to when the offence had taken place.
Counsel then acting for the appellants objected to the prosecution`s application. Counsel argued that the prosecution was not entitled to tailor the charge to suit the evidence, when the prosecution`s own evidence as to the dates was contradictory. The defence was prejudiced as they had relied on an effective `alibi`. The prosecution contended that the discrepancy was not material, but rather one which could have arisen as a result of inaccurate recollection of dates from Leong, Tan and Ang. As for the contentions of alibi, the prosecution pointed out that no notice of alibi had been given.
The district judge allowed the prosecution`s application. The amended charges were read to the appellants, who claimed trial.
 Submission of no case to answer
Counsel for the appellants sought to argue that there was no case to answer. He pointed out that Tan`s credit had been impeached. Leong`s credibility was doubtful. Moreover, it was only after Ringo gave evidence that the prosecution realised that alternate charges were necessary. There could only be one act of corruption which must have taken place on only one date. It was not open to the prosecution to frame the charge in the alternative.
In reply, the prosecution pointed out that Tan`s credit was impeached only on the question of the loan of $2,000. The remainder of Tan`s evidence stood, at least up to the point where he began to retract the evidence in his statement regarding the $2,000. The date of the meeting was not vitally significant. The point was that there was sufficient evidence to show that Leong gave the $2,000 to Garmaz on either 6 July 1991 or 10 July 1991.
The district judge ruled that a prima facie case had been made out, and proceeded to call for the defence of both appellants.
 The defence
 
 
 
 (i) Jaswinder`s defence
 
Jaswinder gave evidence first. He had known Tan for some 20 years. He had known Leong since 1989. Leong had approached him for assistance with his debts to illegal moneylenders. He said he was not in any financial position to assist. He frequented Blue Berry Lounge from 1990 to 1991. He knew that Leong went there as well. He did not know that Leong was working for Tan.
Jaswinder confirmed that he was on 24-hour duty on 5 July 1991, making reference to his pocket diary. He went to Yishun at 2320 hours on 5 July 1991 to investigate a report of fighting at a coffee shop. An incident report, prepared by the operations room personnel, was produced. As such, he could not have been at the Green Lounge on 5 July 1991. He also denied the allegation that $2,000 was handed to him at Yishun. He did not meet Leong and Garmaz there as there was no such incident.
Jaswinder said that he could remember being at the Blue Berry Lounge together with Garmaz, Tan, Leong and Ang. He could not remember the date. He remembered adjourning for more drinks at the Green lounge, where he met Ringo. He had met Ringo a few times there. Jaswinder said that there was `nothing special` about that night when he went out drinking with the others. According to him, it was `a very normal night`.
Jaswinder suggested that Leong might have intended to incriminate him because he had asked for a loan from him and was rejected. He said that his pocket diary showed that on 6 July 1991, he left the police station at 2pm, arrived home at 2.30pm and stayed at home the whole day. It was not possible for Leong to call him at the station to make arrangements to hand over the $2,000. On 9 July 1991, he was at home the whole night. On 10 July 1991, he was at the police station until 6pm when he left for home. He was at home the whole night. He produced a s 122(6) statement which was primarily exculpatory.
In cross-examination, Jaswinder confirmed that in 1993 he had pleaded guilty before the Police Disciplinary Board to a charge of engaging in other employment without the permission of the Commissioner of Police. He explained that this was a plea of convenience as he was about to retire.
 ii Garmaz`s evidence
 
 
Garmaz testified that he recommended `NFA` in respect of Leong`s case as he had genuinely believed that there was insufficient evidence to proceed. The final decision rested with Rosli. He disagreed that he had shown any favour to Leong. In the course of his investigation he did not get to see Leong. He had no part in recording Leong`s statement. He did not see Leong after he commenced investigations. He had never suggested to Leong or anyone else that he could dispose of the case for $2,000.
Garmaz said that the Green Lounge was an informal meeting place for Ang Mo Kio police officers. Jaswinder had never suggested to pay him $2,000 in order to settle Leong`s case. He could recall one evening when Tan, Leong, Ang, Jaswinder and himself were drinking at the Blue Berry Lounge. There was no discussion about paying $2,000 to settle the case. Garmaz said that on 6 July 1991, he should be sleeping at home after his 24-hour duty. He could not remember where he was on 10 July 1991. Like Jaswinder, Garmaz tendered his s 122(6) statement which was again a denial of involvement.
In cross-examination, Garmaz said that he had given one month`s notice of his resignation on 22 January 1993 but that had been rejected, as there was a disciplinary matter pending. He confirmed that he had appeared before a Police Disciplinary Board on 28 June 1993 and had pleaded guilty to a charge of moonlighting.
 The district judge`s decision
The district judge found that the prosecution case hinged primarily on Leong`s evidence. He accepted that Leong`s testimony was credible, except that he chose to accept Ringo`s evidence that the offence had taken place on 10 July 1991 and not 6 July 1991 as asserted by Leong. The district judge thus found both the appellants guilty and convicted them on the alternative charges. They were each sentenced to six months` imprisonment.
 The appeal
(i) The elements of the charges
The first argument raised by counsel for the appellants was that the prosecution had failed to establish key elements in the charges. Counsel for the appellants submitted that the evidence as adduced by the prosecution showed that Jaswinder was the ultimate recipient of the $2,000, and not Garmaz. Accordingly, counsel submitted that the charges were not supported by the evidence, since Garmaz was named as the principal offender, with Jaswinder merely fulfilling the role of the abettor.
In my opinion, there was no merit in this submission. Whatever the intricacies of the arrangement may have been, the evidence adduced through Leong did show the receipt of $2,000 by Garmaz. The prosecution alleged that Jaswinder had promised to `process` Leong`s case, in expectation of some future gratification. The actual payment of the gratification eventually materialised after the arrangement was made in July 1991 for Leong to hand over the $2,000. According to Leong, before the payment was made, he was asked by Tan to speak to Jaswinder to arrange for a meeting. After the payment was made, Garmaz told him that his case had been `NOD`. The evidence was sufficient to enable a causal link to be drawn between the `favour` shown to Leong in 1990 and the payment of $2,000 in 1991. Having regard to the surrounding circumstances, there was a corrupt element involved in the transaction. The presumption of `corruption` in s 8 PCA was properly invoked.
 (ii) The finding of abetment by conspiracy
P2A (the charge against Jaswinder) avers that Jaswinder had abetted Garmaz in the corrupt acceptance of $2,000 by `intentionally arranging` with Tan to give Garmaz the $2,000 through Leong. Jaswinder was thus charged with having committed an offence punishable under s 27(a) (now s 29(a)) read with s 6(a) of the PCA. The district judge went on to find that there was a conspiracy between Garmaz and Jaswinder to satisfy the averment of abetment. This was founded on Leong`s evidence as to what had taken place after his interrogation on 25 September 1990 and the events surrounding the payment of $2,000 to Garmaz which, according to Leong, took place on 6 July 1991.
Counsel submitted that the district judge had misdirected himself by finding that the element of conspiracy had been proved, when the charge preferred against Jaswinder did not aver to any abetment by conspiracy. Section 107 of the Penal Code states that abetment may comprise either instigation, conspiracy, or intentionally aiding. From the words used in the charge, counsel surmised that the case for the prosecution was that Jaswinder had intentionally aided Garmaz in obtaining the $2,000. Counsel suggested that the charge referred incorrectly to s 29 PCA, as an offence under the PCA committed pursuant to a conspiracy was properly covered by s 31 of the PCA instead.
Examining s 29 PCA, it is clear that the meaning of `abetment` within the meaning of the Penal Code applies in relation to the abetment of the commission of an offence under the PCA. The offence of abetment as defined in s 107 Penal Code has an inclusive definition which encompasses an act of conspiracy. There was no real quarrel with the use of the phrase `intentionally arranging` in the charge; it was sufficiently clear for the defence to meet the prosecution case. In my view, there is no useful distinction to be drawn between the district judge`s finding of `conspiracy` and the prosecution`s choice of the phrase `intentionally arranging`. In substance, they mean that Jaswinder had abetted Garmaz in the commission of the offence. It was open to the district judge to say that he was satisfied that there was a conspiracy disclosed on the evidence. While the charge could have specifically averred to abetment by either `conspiracy` or `intentional aiding`, there is no material omission or defect in the charge.
 (ii) Tan`s evidence
Counsel next submitted that the district judge should not have disregarded Tan`s evidence as contained in his statement. The district judge had accepted Tan`s evidence that Jaswinder had called him and asked for a loan of $2,000. Counsel suggested that, notwithstanding that Tan`s credit had been impeached, the district judge should have examined the contents of Tan`s statement and considered whether para 15 of the statement could be admitted as substantive evidence. This submission was based mainly on the dicta of the Court of Appeal in (at p 229). Counsel suggested that s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (`EA`) could be used to admit para 15 of Tan`s previous statement in evidence.
From my perusal of the respective petitions of appeal, it is not clear that the above ground has been raised at all. In any case, I am not persuaded that it merits any real concern. In a recent decision of the Court of Appeal, 
 Foong Seow Ngiu & 
 O, the position hinted at in 
 Ukthunthod 
 was clarified. Section 147(3) EA could be used to admit the previous inconsistent statement of a witness. Had the district judge done so, Tan would have become the primary witness for the prosecution, and not Leong. The effect would be that the prosecution case would have been fraught with difficulty, since Tan and Leong would have been asserting different reasons for the payment of the $2,000. It was precisely for this reason that the prosecution sought to impeach Tan`s credit. The district judge agreed that Tan`s credit was impeached, at least as far as his evidence revealed inconsistencies.
There is no argument that the district judge was entitled to disregard the whole of Tan`s testimony, applying the settled principles of impeachment. The mere fact that his credit had been impeached did not necessarily mean that all his evidence would be disregarded. The court would still have to scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine what was true and which aspects should be disregarded. These principles were stated in , at p 148. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, no arguments on these principles having been raised ().
It is apparent then, that it is well within the province of a trial judge to decide which aspects of the evidence merited consideration, having regard to the entirety of the witness`s testimony, and also, where appropriate, to the case sought to be presented by the party which called him to give evidence. In the present case, this was exactly what the district judge did. No specific reason was suggested by counsel as to why the district judge should have accepted para 15 of the statement as representing the truth of the matter. On the other hand, the district judge explained that he accepted the relevant portions of Tan`s evidence because Leong and Ang had given substantially the same evidence. I see no reason why he was not entitled to proceed on this basis.
Counsel for the appellants went so far as to contend that an offence was only disclosed on the evidence if para 15 of Tan`s statement was taken together with Leong`s evidence. Only then could it be seen that the actual scheme was for Jaswinder to use Garmaz to obtain gratification which was primarily intended for Jaswinder himself. As intimated earlier, I would respectfully disagree. It was not necessary for the prosecution to pitch their case at that level. They were not under any duty to unravel all the potential underlying complexities within the corrupt transaction.
 (iv) Framing the charges in the alternative
Counsel for the appellants contended that the district judge had prejudiced the appellants in preferring charges in the alternative. The only provision within the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) which deals with when an accused person may be `charged in the alternative` is s 172, which reads: 
 
If a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of those offences and any number of the charges may be tried at once or he may be charged in the alternative with having committed some one of the those offences.
 
 
 
The two illustrations to s 172 suggest that the section is really intended to cover situations where it is unclear precisely what offence has been committed. The marginal note confirms this. The key is to examine whether the `single act` or `series of acts` is of `such a nature` as to be capable of being characterised differently as one or more of `several offences`.
In the present case, the prosecution`s decision to amend the charges and frame charges in the alternative against the appellants clearly did not fall within what s 172 CPC envisages. It was not as if the act of corruption alleged was of `such a nature` as to give rise to variable characterisations as several different offences. The amendments were motivated simply by the perceived necessity to get around the difficulty with the discrepancy in the dates. Regrettably, in doing so, they generated the anomaly of suggesting on the face of each charge that there may have been two separate offences on two different dates.
In my opinion, the prosecution`s approach was erroneous. With respect to the district judge, I am of the view that the amendments to the charges should not have been allowed in the form tendered by the prosecution. The proper course was for the prosecution to apply to amend the charge, only to the extent of specifying that the offence was allegedly committed on or about 6 July 1991 or 10 July 1991. In this way, it remains clear on the face of each charge that only one set of facts is relied upon, constituting only one offence. This removes the anomaly created by the alternative charges as framed. In any case, there can be no doubt that the charge would contain particulars which are reasonably sufficient to give the appellants notice of the matter with which they are charged.
Ultimately, the overriding consideration is whether any error or omission in framing the charge was such as to cause the appellants to be prejudiced or misled. In this respect, there is no real difficulty, given that the prosecution`s stand was that they were still prosecuting only one offence of corruption, except that they were unsure when it took place. Moreover, after the application for amendment was allowed on 30 August 1994, the defence was only called on 5 September 1994. There was sufficient time for the defence to reconsider their position and meet the prosecution`s case. The appellants elected not to recall any witnesses. I am satisfied that no prejudice to their defence was occasioned.
 (v) Treatment of the evidence of accomplices
In his grounds of decision, the district judge noted the obvious discrepancy in the prosecution`s case as to the date of the meeting at the Green Lounge. But, he was satisfied that there was consistent evidence of such a meeting having taken place, although there was no clear evidence as to whether it was on 5 July or 9 July 1991. He noted that both appellants did not deny that such a meeting did take place, except that they claimed not to recall when this was.
The district judge accepted that Tan`s evidence fitted in with the evidence of Ang and Leong that a meeting at the Blue Berry Lounge had been arranged. There was also consistent evidence that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss Ong Thian Lye`s arrest. Ringo`s testimony fortified the case that a meeting at the Green Lounge did in fact take place. All this went towards establishing when the offence was committed, since the evidence of Ong Thian Lye`s arrest and the meeting at the Blue Berry and Green lounges were the only common clues pointing to either 6 July 1991 or 10 July 1991 being the date on which the offence was allegedly committed.
The district judge considered that it was incumbent on him to make a finding that the meeting at the Blue Berry and Green Lounges did take place, as the acceptance of the $2,000 by Garmaz in the presence of Jaswinder took place the day after this meeting. The district judge accepted that Ringo`s testimony on the date of the meeting was more reliable, since he was a totally independent witness who had the benefit of reference to his pocket diary.
On appeal, the appellants submitted that the district judge had erred in law in failing to direct his mind to the fact that Tan and especially Leong were accomplices whose evidence should have been treated with caution. This necessitated reference to Illustration (b) to s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (`EA`), which states: 
 
the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution.
 
 
 
The illustration does not say that an accomplice `shall` be presumed to be unworthy of credit. Apart from s 116 EA, two other statutory provisions are relevant. First, s 135 EA provides: 
 
An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is hereby abrogated.
 
 
 
There are clear authorities giving effect to this section, in particular, and . Reading s 135 and Illustration (b) to s 116 EA together, the effect is that the court may convict an accused based on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, but should still treat such evidence with caution as the accomplice may be presumed to be unworthy of credit. This is the general position in respect of the evidence of accomplices. The Court of Appeal in observed (at p 270): 
 
The effect of (s 135 EA) ... is that it is no longer a requirement for a trial judge to give as part of his reasons that he had warned himself before accepting uncorroborated evidence to find an accused person guilty on a charge ... Having said that, we want to make it clear that it is still incumbent on the trial judge to scrutinise and weigh carefully the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice before acting on such evidence.
 
 
 
The first step, of course, is for the court to ascertain that the witnesses in question are accomplices. In the context of corruption cases in particular, it is important to note that s 25 PCA provides that: 
 
Notwithstanding any rule of law or written law to the contrary, no witness shall, in any such trial or inquiry as is referred to in s 24, be presumed to be unworthy of credit by reason only of any payment or delivery by him or on his behalf of any gratification to an agent or member of a public body.
 
 
 
In and , the court observed that s 25 (then s 13(3) Prevention of Corruption Ordinance 1950) modified the general law relating to treatment of the evidence of accomplices. In view of s 25 PCA, the maxim in Illustration (b) to s 116 EA is not invoked by the mere fact that the witness (whether or not he is an accomplice) has paid or delivered any gratification, or arranged for such acts to be done on his behalf, to a police officer. In `s case , Foster Sutton CJ opined that the maxim in Illustration (b) to s 116 EA would still apply, where the accomplice had played an `infamous part` in the corrupt act. On my understanding, this suggests that an accomplice who went beyond merely making a `payment or delivery ... of any gratification to an agent or member of a public body` would not come within the scope of s 25 PCA. Foster Sutton CJ`s view was adopted by Abdul Malik Ishak JC in . A similar approach was also taken by Syed Agil Barakbah J in
In my opinion, the approach in 
 Daimon bin Banda 
 may be adopted. It would appear that s 25 PCA may still apply in relation to Leong, since Leong had claimed not to know what the payment was all about initially. He could not be said to have knowingly played an `active` or `infamous` part in the transaction when he was not even aware that there was a corrupt element to the transaction at all. Only Tan could be said to be instrumental in initiating the corrupt transaction. In the premises, it could only be said that the district judge should have treated Tan`s evidence with caution. It appears to me that this was another reason why the district judge was only prepared to accept those aspects of Tan`s evidence which were supported by Leong.
While corroboration was not necessary to support Leong`s evidence, I am conscious that there was, strictly speaking, no corroboration. The evidence of Tan, Ang and even Ringo did not go to support Leong`s account of what transpired at Yishun Seafood Restaurant. Their evidence only went to show that a meeting did take place at the Blue Berry and Green Lounges on either 5 July 1991 or 9 July 1991. Adopting the classic formulation of principle in , there is only corroboration if there was independent evidence which implicated the appellants of the offence by connecting them with it, or evidence which confirmed in some material particular that the appellants had committed the offence.
The prosecution`s case was anchored primarily on Leong`s uncorroborated evidence. Even though there is no requirement for special caution, it was still incumbent on the trial judge to scrutinise the evidence with care. This is particularly so when the process of weighing the evidence consists primarily of pitting one person`s word against another`s. The prosecution is not relieved of the burden of proof. Counsel has pointed out some flaws and inconsistencies in Leong`s evidence. It appears to me, however, that Leong`s evidence was fairly consistent and did not reveal any material discrepancies. The only notable discrepancy as far as the prosecution was concerned is that Leong claimed to be sure that the offence took place on 6 July 1991, when Ringo alleged that it occurred on 10 July 1991. Having scrutinised Leong`s evidence, the district judge accepted that Leong was a witness of truth. The appellants would therefore have to prevail upon this court to rule that such a conclusion was plainly wrong.
 (vi) Whether notice of alibi required
The district judge agreed with the DPP`s submissions that the evidence of the appellants had to be treated with caution as they had not complied with the requirements in s 182 CPC. These relate to the provision of notice of alibi within the prescribed time. Moreover, in the two s 122(6) statements produced by the appellants, there was no mention of the claim that they were on 24-hour duty on 5 July 1991. The district judge found the lack of reference to an alibi defence to be a material non-disclosure.
On appeal, counsel for the appellants submitted that adverse inferences should not have been drawn from the `non-compliance` with s 182 CPC. By ruling that the appellants had not furnished the alibi notice and proceeding to treat their evidence with caution, the district judge had effectively raised the burden on the defence beyond the level of establishing reasonable doubt. In particular, counsel drew the court`s attention to the fact that the charge had averred that the place where he had abetted the commission of the offence was Ang Mo Kio police station. Jaswinder`s evidence was precisely that he was at Ang Mo Kio police station for the better part of the day, on both 6 July 1991 and 10 July 1991. Accordingly, no notice of alibi was required, as he was not claiming to have been somewhere else other than the place specified in the charge.
Counsel submitted in the alternative that, in any event, the alibi evidence was given within the prescribed period of 14 days from the time the amended alternative charges were read to both appellants. On this premise, the evidence was said to have been given within the time frame within which the appellants could have given any alibi evidence.
I shall deal with counsel`s alternative argument first. The argument does not purport to dispense with the requirement for an alibi notice in respect of the original charge. Under s 182 CPC, the accused is not permitted to give evidence in support of an alibi without the leave of the court unless notice of particulars of the alibi has been given before the end of the prescribed period (see also s 182(5) CPC). Section 182(9) CPC states: 
 
In this section -
 
 
 
`evidence in support of an alibi` means evidence tending to show that by reason of the presence of the accused at a particular place or in a particular area at a particular time he was not, or was unlikely to have been, at the place where the offence is alleged to have been committed at the time of its alleged commission;
 
 
 
`prescribed period` means the period of 14 days from the end of the proceedings before the Magistrate on the occasion that the accused is charged in court for the first time with the offence in respect of which he raising the defence of an alibi.
 
 
 
With respect, s 182 CPC does not say that alibi evidence becomes admissible simply by virtue of the fact that it is adduced in court within the prescribed 14-day period. The requirement is for notice of particulars of the alibi evidence to be given within the prescribed period. The purpose is to enable the prosecution to verify the accused`s account so that they are able to challenge the accused`s version of events if it is appropriate to do so (). No such opportunity will be afforded if the `notice` can be constituted by merely raising the defence within 14 days of the amendment of the charge. Counsel`s argument therefore is not persuasive.
I turn now to examine counsel`s main submission on the question of the alibi notice. In cross-examination, Garmaz said that on 6 July 1991, he should have been sleeping at home after his 24-hour duty. It should be noted that he was not asserting this with any certainty or conviction. It was not part of his evidence-in-chief, in any event. Consequently, it is doubtful whether Garmaz was really relying on an alibi defence at all. Garmaz also said that he could not remember where he was on 10 July 1991. Thus, it is clear that he was not claiming to be somewhere else other than the place where the offence was allegedly committed on 10 July 1991. This was not evidence in support of an alibi.
Jaswinder asserted that on 6 July 1991 he was at the station and he arrived home at 2.30pm and stayed home the whole day. On 10 July 1991, he was again at the station, reaching home by 6.30pm in the evening and he stayed at home the whole night. As such, there is some merit in counsel`s point that Jaswinder was not raising evidence in support of an alibi at all, since Leong`s evidence was that he contacted Jaswinder in the afternoon on the day when the money was delivered. Jaswinder`s evidence was basically a denial of having received any telephone call from Leong at all. I agree, therefore, that there was no requirement for Jaswinder to furnish a notice of alibi. It made no difference whether this was in relation to the alleged commission of the offences on 6 July 1991 or 10 July 1991. In all fairness to the district judge, he may have been misled by counsel`s agreement during the trial that the defence raised was indeed one of alibi.
Counsel for the appellants contended that the district judge had misdirected himself in law by his finding of material non-disclosures in respect of the alibi evidence, from his perusal of the appellants` s 122(6) statements. Once again, this argument merits consideration. There was no reliance on an alibi defence at all. A fortiori, there could not have been any material non-disclosure. I concur with counsel`s submission that s 123 CPC was wrongly invoked by the district judge. While the district judge did not expressly say that he drew adverse inferences from this non-disclosure, it seems implicit from the judge`s grounds that this was the consequence.
 (vii) Impeachment procedure in relation to Tan`s evidence
A further point raised on appeal was that the district judge had erred in law in failing to follow the prescribed procedure for impeachment of a witness`s credit. The contention was that the district judge should not have permitted counsel for the appellants and counsel holding a watching brief for Tan (Mr TU Naidu) to participate in the procedure for impeachment. Secondly, counsel contended that the district judge did not proceed to receive the further evidence of Tan by way of evidence-in-chief after the impeachment proceedings, thereby depriving the court of the benefit of his further evidence.
The district judge`s note of evidence reveals that Mr Naidu did cross-examine Sng Jin Poh (PW3), who was called to testify on the recording of the statement from Tan. There is no apparent precedent for this procedure. Assuming this was erroneous, there was no material irregularity which had occasioned a failure of justice. In my view, this similarly disposes of the arguments raised under this ground. The prosecution had no further need for Tan`s evidence after the impeachment proceedings, and he was thus released. These courses of action met with no objections whatsoever from defence counsel.
 (viii) Evidence adduced in respect of appearing before Police DisciplinaryBoard - rebuttal of character evidence
The appellants were both asked in cross-examination about their respective appearances before the Police Disciplinary Board. Both of them admitted to having pleaded guilty to disciplinary charges. The convictions related to engaging in other employment without permission of the Commissioner of Police (Jaswinder) and moonlighting (Garmaz). Counsel objected to the DPP`s question only in respect of Garmaz, but not in relation to Jaswinder. Jaswinder explained that he pleaded guilty out of convenience. Garmaz gave no explanation.
On appeal, it has been submitted that there was a miscarriage of justice in that the district judge had wrongly admitted the above evidence, and gone on to draw adverse inferences against both appellants. Counsel pointed to the line of questioning adopted by the defence in relation to Leong, which resulted in Leong`s disclosure that he had been charged in court and convicted of an offence under the PCA many years ago. Counsel submitted that this approach was perfectly legitimate, since Leong had given evidence of his payment of $2,000 to the appellants and was clearly an accomplice. It was not to be taken to be an attack on Leong`s character, such that the appellants would have correspondingly lowered their shield by bringing in Leong`s previous conviction. Counsel argued that the question was meant to ascertain whether Leong, being an accomplice, had been dealt with in court for the role he had played. If so, the court would be justified in giving his evidence greater weight, since he had nothing more to gain by falsifying evidence. It was also emphasised that Leong had volunteered the information, and neither the DPP nor the court had objected to this line of questioning.
With respect, I do not find counsel`s submissions helpful. First, it assumes that Leong was an accomplice, when no such finding has been made by the court. More importantly, the question which counsel asked Leong at trial was this: `Were you ever arrested by CPIB and charged for any offence?` The sweeping references to `ever arrested` and `any offence` were clearly meant to cover all previous convictions, and not just arrest or conviction arising from that particular offence involving the appellants. I do not see how Leong had `volunteered` the information when he was only giving his response to a question posed by counsel in cross-examination. To all intents and purposes, it appears that the main purpose of the question was to raise an issue as to Leong`s credibility. In my view, the facts fell squarely within s 122(7) EA. The appellants should be taken to have lowered their shield.
The Police Disciplinary Board convictions are not really connected in any way with the corruption charges in question. They do not indicate a propensity towards corruption. As such, the probative value of the evidence is minimal. At best, there is only some relevance towards the appellants` credibility, although I find it difficult to say that this shows that they were generally of bad disposition or reputation.
It is not clear whether any adverse inferences were drawn against Garmaz, although the district judge did take note of the fact that Garmaz had also appeared before the Police Disciplinary Board. The district judge, however, noted Jaswinder`s explanation and stated that he viewed this evidence with caution `as it could be inferred that (Jaswinder) has a propensity to lie`. With great respect, I am unable to follow the district judge`s reasoning. The prosecution did not suggest that Jaswinder was lying when he explained why he had pleaded guilty. In the absence of any other clear reasons, there is hardly any basis for inferring that Jaswinder had a propensity to lie.
 (ix) Analysis of the defence submissions
Counsel has strenuously argued that the numerous alleged errors or misdirections indicate that there was a miscarriage of justice, and that the defence had been prejudiced. I find that the district judge had erred in his treatment of certain issues. Specifically, these are: (i) the decision to allow the alternative charges to be preferred; (ii) the ruling that notice of alibi was necessary; and (iii) the inference that Jaswinder had a propensity to lie, on account of his explanation for his plea of guilt before the Police Disciplinary Board.
I have already expressed my view that no failure of justice was occasioned by the decision to allow alternative charges to be preferred. As for the point relating to the alibi notice, it is necessary to consider what the effect of the misdirection was. It appears to me that all the district judge said was that he would have to be more careful in dealing with the appellants` evidence. He remained conscious that the defence only needed to raise a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, the district judge was clearly not entitled to draw adverse inferences pursuant to s 123 CPC. By his reference to `material non-disclosures`, it was evident that he had misdirected himself. Regrettably, this error was compounded by his willingness to infer that Jaswinder had a propensity to lie, when such an inference was quite unjustifiable on the evidence. These adverse inferences were erroneously drawn against the appellants, and must be excluded from consideration of the evidence against them.
The appeals turn on findings of fact. When one looks at the fundamentals, the main question is whether the allegations which found the prosecution case can be believed, such that the case can be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. I need not traverse the settled principles which guide appellate courts in interfering with findings of fact and credibility. As I have intimated earlier, the critical issue is whether it can be said that the district judge was plainly wrong in accepting that Leong was a witness of truth. Other than the contention that Leong`s evidence should have been treated with caution, which I do not accept, the defence has not presented any cogent argument on this basis.
The district judge`s treatment of the case was not flawless. I am unable to agree with the suggestion, however, that the errors or misdirections were so grave as to vitiate his conclusion that the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. I do not see any indication that the district judge`s assessment of Leong`s credibility had been affected by these errors. While the district judge may have erred in drawing adverse inferences against the appellants, I do not see how this has any material bearing on the fact that their defences were essentially bare denials. In the premises, I find no reason to interfere with the district judge`s acceptance that Leong was telling the truth.
 (x) Amendment of the charges and the public prosecutor`s consent
The only difficulty with the convictions in this case is that the alternative charges on which the appellants were convicted were patently inappropriate. In this connection, I turn now to consider whether the charges can be amended. Counsel argued that if this court was minded to amend the charges, it could only do so with the consent of the public prosecutor. Counsel submitted that this was what s 33 PCA necessarily implied. Section 33 PCA states: 
 
A prosecution under this Act shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Public Prosecutor.
 
 
 
It was urged upon this court that the amendments would effectively bring in new or different charges. Consequently, counsel argued that once such consent was obtained, the only available recourse was for this court to order a fresh trial, as the public prosecutor had not previously consented to the prosecution of the appellants on the amended charges.
This point requires some consideration. Counsel was unable to cite any authority directly supporting his propositions, nor could he point to any cases dealing with a similar question. , a decision of Kulasekaram J, is of no real assistance. It was only concerned with whether the form of the consent contained sufficient reference to the facts of the case. On the face of the consent in question, it did not contain reference to the facts upon which the consent was given. The prosecution did not adduce any further evidence to show the facts for which the consent was applicable. Kulasekaram J thus held that the prosecution had failed to comply with s 31 (now s 33 PCA) of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance 1960.
The Malaysian cases, tracing their lineage to , or are of even less assistance. The settled Malaysian position has been to consider a deputy public prosecutor as being capable of exercising all the rights and powers of the public prosecutor. Thus, it falls within the DPP`s powers to consent to a prosecution under the PCA (per Smith J in 
 Abdul Hamid 
, at p 232). It follows from this proposition that where prosecution is conducted by a DPP, the consent of the public prosecutor is implicit in his actions and no further written consent of the public prosecutor is required. Indeed, this was the holding of the Privy Council in . The ruling in 
 Oie Hee Koi 
 was followed in , , and .
Counsel submitted that the Malaysian cases were generally of limited persuasiveness, having proceeded as they did on the broad premise that a deputy public prosecutor may validly exercise all the powers of the public prosecutor. For comparative purposes, counsel diligently produced a copy of the Government Gazette S 281/85, which contains the Attorney General`s notification empowering his deputies to perform specific duties and functions. These do not include any reference to the public prosecutor`s function of issuing consent to the institution of prosecution pursuant to s 33 PCA.
Counsel referred me to a decision of the then senior district judge in . In this case, the DPP tendered amended charges under the PCA even before trial began. There was an existing consent from the public prosecutor in respect of the original charges. The question was whether the court had jurisdiction to proceed with the trial on the amended charges without a fresh consent by the public prosecutor. The district judge held that he did not have jurisdiction. He rejected the DPP`s submission, which was premised on the approach adopted in the Malaysian cases to the effect that a DPP was capable of granting consent in lieu of the public prosecutor. The prosecution discontinued its appeal.
In , a problem similar to that in 
 Wong Cheong Yoon 
 arose. Harun J ruled that as the public prosecutor had not given his consent for the amended charge, the trial was a nullity. This decision was not followed in 
 Mohamed Halipah 
. Yusof Abdul Rashid J took the view that no further written consent was required, as the DPP could amend the charge in his exercise of the powers of the public prosecutor. It was noted that Harun J had not been referred to the Privy Council decision in 
 Oie Hee Koi 
.
What is in issue at present is perhaps a more basic question: what does s 33 PCA specify? On a plain reading, it simply means that the public prosecutor`s consent is required before a prosecution under the PCA can be instituted. In , the meaning of `instituting` prosecution was considered. Wills J concluded that it means the commencement of prosecution. When prosecution can be said to have commenced is dependent on whether any peculiar requirements for prosecution may operate in each case. For instance, in the present case, every offence under the PCA is seizable. Quite obviously, prosecution does not commence the moment the accused is arrested, as the Attorney General`s consent may not be forthcoming at the point of arrest. I would agree with the views of the district court in 
 Wong Cheong Yoon 
(at p 268) thus: 
 
... the moment the public prosecutor decides on such a course, ie to have the alleged offender charged and tried in court, this will signify the `commencement` of the prosecution of the alleged offender under the Act.
 
 
 
I should add that in , the Federal Court took the view that a prosecution for the purposes of the Malaysian Prevention of Corruption Act 1961 was instituted when the accused was called upon to plead to the charge. It is not open to me to adopt this view, on account of the marked difference between the relevant statutory provisions.
Counsel submitted that the public prosecutor retains overall control and direction over all criminal prosecutions, on account of s 336 CPC. Consenting to prosecution under the PCA was part and parcel of these responsibilities. Accordingly, if the charge had to be amended, it required his consent anew, as he had only directed his mind to the facts constituting the original charge. Nevertheless, counsel conceded that if the amendment was minor or purely typographical, perhaps it would not be necessary for a fresh consent to be obtained.
In my opinion, the general proposition that flows from s 33 PCA is that the public prosecutor`s consent is only a prerequisite to the commencement of prosecution. Having regard to Kulasekaram J`s observations in 
 Nagalingam 
, the duty of the public prosecutor under s 33 PCA is to apply his mind to whether prosecution should commence under the PCA in respect of a particular accused on a particular set of facts. There is nothing which expressly requires the Attorney General as public prosecutor to give his consent afresh if the charge has to be amended after the prosecution has commenced. None of the authorities refutes this general proposition. This proposition would not apply, however, if what had been sought was, for example, to introduce a different set of material facts, or to prefer more serious charges against the accused than those expressly specified in the existing consent. A fortiori, it should not apply if the amendment seeks to frame a new charge for which the public prosecutor`s consent under a different statute might have been needed.
I hasten to add that the approach I have adopted is not based on the Malaysian approach of considering the DPP equally competent to exercise the public prosecutor`s powers. I propose to leave this line of argument open for subsequent discussion, since this appeal does not turn on whether the Malaysian approach should be adopted.
Reverting to the present case, the public prosecutor has given his consent to prosecution in clear terms and has specified the appropriate charge in each case. The essential facts have also been set out in the consents and the charges from the outset. They have remained unchanged. Indeed, consents from the public prosecutor were in fact obtained twice, for both the original charges as well as the amended alternative charges. The amendments which I propose to make do not bring the charges beyond the scope of the PCA, nor do they seek to introduce any material new facts. In the circumstances, I see no reason why the public prosecutor`s consent should be obtained a third time.
The only amendments which I deem necessary are to eliminate the `alternative` charges, and to introduce the alternative date into the original charges. I see this as being the lesser of two evils. This removes the anomaly in the present charges, which seem to suggest that two distinct offences could have been committed on different dates. The amended charges will read as follows. In respect of Garmaz: 
 
You, Garmaz s/o Pakhar M/32 yrs, NRIC No S1449144/I are charged that you, on or about 6 or 10 July 1991, at the Yishun Seafood Village Restaurant, Sembawang Road, Singapore being an agent, to wit, a Police Sergeant in the employ of the Singapore Police Force and attached to the Ang Mo Kio Police Station, did corruptly accept from Barlly Tan Kim Hock through one Leong Kin Eng @ Christopher Leong for yourself a gratification of a sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000) as an inducement for you to do an act in relation to your principal`s affairs, to wit, recommend to take no further action on a case against the said Leong Kin Eng who was being investigated by you for illegal money-lending, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
In respect of Jaswinder: 
 
You, Jaswinder Singh s/o Mota Singh M/46 yrs, NRIC 1027086/C are charged that you, on or about 6 or 10 July 1991, at the Ang Mo Kio Police Station, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 9, Singapore, did abet one Garmaz s/o Pakhar, in the commission of an offence of corruptly accepting a gratification of $2,000, to wit, by intentionally arranging with one Barlly Tan Kim Hock to give the said sum of money to him through one Leong Kin Eng which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 27(a) read with s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
I am mindful that neither the prosecution nor the defence has voiced any objection to an amendment to the charges, save that the defence contends that the Attorney General`s fresh consent is required. I have already clarified my views on this contention. I should state nonetheless that in doing so, I respectfully decline to follow the decisions of and . In these cases, it was held that the High Court, acting in its appellate capacity, could not amend the charge. In , no reasons were given for Wee Chong Jin CJ`s ruling. In , it was conceded by the prosecution that the court could not convict the accused on an amended charge. Whyatt CJ agreed that this was because s 156 (now s 163) CPC requires the amended charge to be read and explained to the accused, and it was not necessarily the case that the accused would be present on appeal. It appears that Whyatt CJ`s concern was because the accused might then wish to tailor his evidence to the amended charge or to adduce fresh evidence or recall witnesses.
With respect, the reason given in 
 Quek Ching Kim 
 is not persuasive. Where a custodial sentence is involved, the accused is bonded to appear in the High Court whenever he lodges an appeal against his conviction. There is thus no question of his absence from the High Court when his appeal is being heard, unless the sentence was a fine only. Furthermore, there are authorities which suggest that the High Court may `alter the finding` pursuant to the current s 256(b)(ii) CPC and convict the appellant on a substituted charge (see , , , and ). It is hard to see why the High Court may not also `alter the finding` by convicting on an amended charge. After all, substituting a charge surely has more far-reaching consequences than amending a charge. The cases which sanction the substitution of a charge emphasise that safeguards should apply to prevent prejudice to the appellant. Thus, for instance, Cussen J in 
 Ng Ee 
`s case26 observed (at p 149): 
 
It is, of course, a power to be exercised with great caution, and only where it is clear beyond all doubt, from the nature of the offence and the record of the evidence in the case, that to do so can in no way prejudice the case of the accused; it must be clear that if the substituted charge had in fact been the original charge that the proceedings at the trial would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded been the same - that the prosecution evidence would have been unchanged (substantially) and the accused`s defence the same.
 
 
 
In short, the court must be certain that the amendment should not affect the substance of the evidence given in the proceedings below. There is no practical utility in requiring the charge to be read and explained again to the accused, since there is no question of him seeking to tailor his evidence or adduce fresh evidence to meet the amended charge. For these reasons, I do not accept the reasoning and the conclusion in 
 Quek Ching Kim 
. It is implicit that, if the High Court can `alter the finding` pursuant to s 256(b)(ii) CPC, it can also amend the charge, as long as the safeguards against prejudice are taken into account.
I am satisfied that the amended charges can in no way prejudice the appellants` defence. The amendments only pertain to the form of the charges. It is clear that the proceedings in the trial would have taken the same course. The evidence recorded would have been the same. Accordingly, I see no difficulty in ordering the amendments. The appellants will stand convicted on the amended charges as I am satisfied that the case has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
Counsel made a brief plea in mitigation of sentence. I am unable to discern any grounds to disturb the sentence of six months` imprisonment which was imposed. In the premises, I uphold the convictions and sentences of both appellants. Both their appeals will be dismissed.

On 19 September 1995 I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against conviction and sentence, and now set out my grounds for doing so.
The appellant was tried and convicted in the district court on charges of corruption. The first charge read: 
 
You, Tan Khee Koon, Male/46 years, NRIC No 0265656F are charged that you, on a day in August 1982, at the Commercial Crime Division of Criminal Investigation Department at Robinson Road, Singapore, being an agent, to wit a Police Staff Sergeant in the employ of the Singapore Police Force, Ministry of Home Affairs, and attached to the Commercial Crime Division, did corruptly attempt to obtain for yourself a gratification of a sum of $20,000 (Twenty Thousand Dollars) from one Ng Kwee Seng, a director-cum-manager of Wei Mark Trading Pte Ltd, as an inducement for forbearing to do an act in relation to your principal`s affairs, to wit, by refraining from prosecuting the said Ng Kwee Seng for committing offences of criminal breach of trust, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
The second charge was in the same terms, but in reference to a period between August 1982 and late 1983, relating to the receipt of gratification of a total sum of $5,260 in cash, a $500 hamper, a $700 writing desk and a $265 chair.
The third charge read: 
 
You, Tan Khee Koon, Male/46 years, NRIC No 0265656F, are charged that you, on a day in January or February 1983, at Circuit Road, Singapore, being an agent , to wit, a Police Staff Sergeant in the employ of the Singapore Police Force, Ministry of Home Affairs, and attached to the Commercial Crime Division, did corruptly receive for a Police Sergeant Tan Beng Wah, a gratification, to wit, a hamper worth $500 and a red packet of $500, from one Ng Kwee Seng, a director-cum-manager of Wei Mark Trading Pte Ltd, as an inducement to the said Tan Beng Wah to refrain from prosecuting the said Ng Kwee Seng for committing offences of criminal breach of trust and cheating, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
The fourth charge was for cheating; the appellant was acquitted but the prosecution did not appeal against that decision.
 The prosecution`s case below
The complainant, Ng Kwee Seng, was under investigation by the Commercial Crime Division (CCD) on several complaints, including one by an Ng Hoy Keng (NHK). The appellant recorded a statement from the complainant in July or August 1982. The appellant informed the complainant that he could assist him in all the complaints except NHK`s, provided the complainant paid him $20,000. The complainant told the appellant that he would consider the offer. Just after the session, $200 was given by the complainant to the appellant when the latter asked for money.
Some days later, the appellant was informed that the offer was accepted, but payment had to be made in instalments. The appellant agreed to this but the quantum of each instalment was not specified. At the meeting where the agreement was reached, the complainant made a first payment of $1,000.
Throughout late 1982 and early 1983 various other payments and presents were made. The first of these occurred around September 1982. On this occasion, the appellant visited the complainant`s office and received $500. Having noticed in the office a desk and a chair during previous visits, the appellant asked the complainant for them and the complainant agreed. The two of them moved the furniture to the appellant`s home using a pick-up hired by the complainant.
In about the same period, the two met again at the Bukit Turf Club, where the appellant received a sum of $500. Another $500 was received in November 1982 at a Paya Lebar Road coffeeshop. In January 1983, the appellant asked for two hampers and two red packets. One of these hampers and a red packet were purportedly to be given to one Sergeant Tan Beng Wah (TBW), who was also involved in some investigations against the complainant. These items were handed over to the appellant at his father`s house. In February 1983, the appellant asked for some money for the purchase of furniture. He was given $1,000.
In that year, the complainant was charged only on the complaint by NHK. After this, the appellant reminded the complainant to pay him the $20,000 agreed to, which led to another $1,000 being paid. At the end of the year, when the appellant told the complainant that the appellant`s wife had just given birth, the complainant gave the appellant $60.
No further sums were given after this as the complainant was in financial difficulties. In 1985, after the complainant had stopped giving money, the appellant warned that he would stop assisting the complainant. A police gazette was eventually issued leading to the arrest of the complainant. He was then charged.
After his arrest, the complainant confronted the appellant in front of other officers. In this confrontation, the payments and gifts made to the appellant were mentioned by the complainant. The appellant remained silent in the face of such disclosures. During the recording of a statement by the complainant, the complainant was informed falsely by the appellant that it was actually TBW who had caused the gazette to be issued. However, the complainant subsequently learnt that this was untrue, and the gazette had indeed been issued by the appellant.
While TBW was interrogating the complainant on another matter, it was disclosed to him that the hamper and red packet were to be given to him. TBW questioned the appellant about these items, but the appellant remained silent.
After what had happened, the complainant was so distrustful of the appellant that during an interrogation by the appellant, the complainant insisted upon an interpreter being present.
As the appellant was in the employment of the government, he had committed offences under ss 6(a) and 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (the Act).
 The defence
The defence was basically one of denial. A number of facts were in dispute, relating to the desk, the gratification, the credibility of some of the witnesses, that of the complainant, the absence of misconduct, the confrontation between the complainant and the appellant, and finally, the conduct of the prosecution.
 (a) The desk
The desk was admitted to have been given to the appellant but not by the complainant. It was given rather by one Tan Seng Lee (Tan). Tan testified that he had noticed the desk at the complainant`s workplace. As the complainant told him that it was not wanted, Tan arranged for it to be given to the appellant. The complainant was not told whom it was given to. Neither was the appellant told whom it was from. Some movers did the transporting of the desk; as the desk was heavy, more than two persons were required to move it. A difficulty encountered during the moving of the desk was that there was a side attachment which could not be removed.
 (b) The other gratification
It made no sense for the appellant to risk asking for the money and receiving it in public places, such as the Turf Club.
 (c) Credibility of witnesses
The prosecution had attempted to support the fact of payment by the testimony of the complainant`s stepmother and brother that they had given the complainant some money, supposedly for `coffee money` for a government official. The credibility of the step-mother`s testimony was doubtful as she had testified that, in all that time before the trial, she had never asked what her testimony was to have been for. The brother`s evidence had to be rejected as he had testified that he was asked by the complainant to say that the complainant had borrowed a sum of money from him. No evidence was given that such money given to the complainant was in fact passed on to the appellant. Neither was TBW a credible witness for he ought to have known of the issue of the police gazette against the complainant and yet he testified that he had not known of it.
 (d) Credibility of the complainant
A number of points were raised about the complainant`s credibility. It was pointed out that the complainant failed to give the name of the shop where the hampers were bought, though these were substantial purchases. Neither could the plaintiff have been able to make the payments alleged as he had no regular income during the material period. It was also suspicious that the complainant did not raise the allegations of corruption until some time after he was charged in court. In addition, several other supposed discrepancies were noted.
 (e) No misconduct
No misconduct at all occurred in the investigations involving the complainant. Though his superiors had indeed instructed him to reopen investigations, there was no allegation that the appellant was at fault in any way. That the investigations went through slowly was because a number of other matters with higher priority came up.
 (f) The confrontation
As for the confrontation between the complainant and the appellant, no report was made to the superior officers which indicate that no allegations of bribery were made. DSP Yap Kiang Keong, the Chief Investigating Officer, did not receive any report from TBW concerning the allegations. As for the presence of an interpreter during the recording of the complainant`s statement by the appellant, that was not indicative of anything as she was used so as to render the statement admissible in court.
 (g) The conduct of the prosecution
Difficulties were faced conducting the defence as the prosecution failed to disclose the relevant investigation papers.
 The decision
The conviction was grounded upon the testimony of the complainant. He was found to be a reliable witness, as he had detailed knowledge of the details of the meeting and the appellant`s particulars during the material period. In contrast, it was found that the appellant was not a truthful witness.
Dealing first with the desk, the judge accepted the complainant`s evidence that it was received from him. Tan`s version was rejected for there were several shortcomings in it. For example, he was unable to describe the desk, he was mistaken as to the attachment of the side piece to the desk, and had testified that several persons were required to move it, while it was clear that two persons could do so. Tan`s credit was found to have been impeached. He had previously made a statement which contradicted his testimony. In it, Tan stated that he had not given the desk to the appellant. Tan challenged the statement on the grounds that what was recorded was not what he had said. However, on the testimony of the recorder, the judge accepted that the statement was made voluntarily and that it was a true record of what was said. The facts in the statement were considered true.
There was corroborative evidence for the complainant`s testimony that he had given the desk to the appellant. That testimony was further supported by the complainant`s brother and step-mother who revealed that they had given the complainant money to pay over to a government official as `coffee money`.
The lack of response on the appellant`s part to the allegations made during the confrontation between him and the complainant was also thought significant. Other witnesses too testified that he had remained silent. In contrast, the appellant`s allegations that the complainant had said that he was going to be fixed up was not found to have been supported by any witness at all.
It was considered odd as well that the appellant could not remember the specifics of the complainant`s allegations during that confrontation, and yet was able to deny that the complainant had made allegations of payment of money and the giving of goods.
The trial judge thought it significant that though investigations against the complainant commenced in 1982, the charge was not proceeded with until March 1987, when the complainant had stopped making payments to the appellant. Those investigations were in fact found to have been poorly conducted when another officer, Cheok Koon Seng, examined the papers in 1985.
As for the appellant`s contention that an interpreter was used in the recording of the complainant`s cautioned statement to render the statement admissible, the judge found that it could not be believed, and it therefore was rejected; instead, the complainant`s contrary assertion that an interpreter was required because he did not trust the appellant was accepted.
Finally, it was noted that though the defence lamented investigation papers not being produced, no application for the investigation papers was in fact made.
 The appeal
A number of issues were present on appeal. These were the effect of the silence of the appellant on being confronted, the value of the evidence of the complainant, and, though it was not raised by counsel on appeal, the overlap between the first and second charges against the appellant.
In addition, several criticisms were made in the petition of the findings of fact. These related to the transport of the table, the description and record of purchase of the hampers, the discrepancy as to the date of the birth of the child, and the time it took for a complaint to be made. As for the complainant`s brother, it was contended that his evidence was unreliable as he was briefed, and his and the complainant`s step-mother`s testimonies ought not have been accepted as they were related to the complainant. Among the contentions made were that: the complainant`s s 122(6) statement recorded by the appellant was not produced; and that DSP Yap Kiang Keong, TBW`s superior, was not informed by TBW of the attempted bribery.
In the submissions before this court, it was primarily argued that the judge was wrong to rely on the complainant`s evidence alone, unsupported by independent evidence. This will be dealt with first. The issues will then be dealt with in the following order: production of investigation papers, the other evidence, the specific charges and the sentence imposed.
 Corroboration of the evidence of the complainant
The issue here was whether the complainant`s evidence required either corroboration or cautious treatment. At common law, corroboration was necessary in a number of situations involving witnesses whose credibility was suspect. These were accomplices, victims of sexual offences and children. In the absence of corroboration, the judge was required to warn himself of the dangers of convicting without such evidence. This approach is exemplified in the case of where it was stated at p 156 that: 
 
(1) The uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is admissible, and a conviction founded on such evidence is not illegal.
(2) But it is a rule of practice virtually equivalent to a rule of law that the presiding judge must warn the jury of the danger of convicting on such evidence. 
... 
(6) The corroboration must be evidence which implicates the accused. Evidence tending merely to show that a crime has been committed is insufficient.
 
 
 
In 1976 though, there were a number of changes in the law. Among these was a new section 135 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97), which reads: 
 
An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is hereby abrogated.
 
 
 
No warning was therefore required. However, s 116 of the Evidence Act still allows a court to presume, inter alia, 
 
(b) that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution.
 
 
 
While s 116 is couched in terms of a discretion, there is no doubt that in most instances, the courts will still treat accomplice evidence with more caution than normal. The rationale for this is the same as that at common law: the accomplice is an interested party, who would have reasons of his own to exaggerate the culpability of or implicate the accused, while reducing the magnitude or importance of his own involvement in the matter. The present law then is that no warning against conviction of the accused on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is required. Nonetheless, the accomplice`s evidence still needs to be treated with caution.
In corruption cases, however, regard must be had as well to the provisions of the Act itself. Section 25 reads: 
 
Notwithstanding any rule of law or written law to the contrary, no witness shall, in any such trial or inquiry as is referred to in s 24, be presumed to be unworthy of credit by reason only of any payment or delivery by him or on his behalf of any gratification to an agent or member of a public body.
 
 
 
This section was first enacted in 1950 in Malaya, and in 1960 in Singapore. It is apparently a uniquely local innovation ().
The legislative intention of the section was noted by the Federal Court in 
 Ng Kok Lian 
 at p 381: 
 
According to the then Attorney General, Mr Stafford Foster Sutton, whose opinion was printed as objects and reasons for the introduction of the bill to enact the 1950 Ordinance, a giver of a bribe is in strict law an accomplice and if corroboration of his evidence is required in any case it would lead to unjust acquittal of the accused. Hence it is considered that the presumption against an accomplice`s evidence should have no application to `such offence as the giving of bribes`. (
 FM Gazette Supplement
 No 185/1950 dated 25 January 1950).
 
 
 
No doubt the same intentions could be imputed to the Singapore legislature as well. It is apparent then that s 25 was intended to remove the need for corroboration. The evidence of an accomplice was not to be presumed against as being of so little credit that it would require corroboration from other sources.
One of the first cases to interpret the section was , a decision of the High Court in Kuala Lumpur in its appellate jurisdiction. After having stated the normal rule then that it was not safe to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice unless there was exceptional evidence, Taylor J said at p 11: 
 
The deputy public prosecutor said that in corruption cases the rule does not apply by reason of s 13(3) [the equivalent of s 25] of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance 1950. That provision, however, does not abrogate the rule. It introduces only a limited modification. It does not apply to accomplices generally. The word `accomplice` does not appear in the subsection. The effect of the new provision is that in corruption cases the mere fact that a man has made an improper payment is not by itself enough to brand the man as a person whose evidence, if uncorroborated, is probably untrustworthy. If the man has taken part in the transaction in such a way as to show that, apart from the bare payment, he was an accomplice, then the ordinary rule applies.
 
 
 
The subsection is in the nature of an exception to a standing rule of evidence, and, as an exception, it must be construed strictly. It must not be extended. If it appears that a man has made a payment and therefore may be within this exception, it is necessary to scrutinise his evidence very carefully. The court may decline to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of such a witness. It is highly desirable that whenever a magistrate applies this subsection he should specifically refer to it in his judgment and analyse the evidence of the witnesses concerned.
Two things are evident. The first is that, even if a witness fell within the section, the opinion of Taylor J was that his evidence still had to be evaluated very carefully. Secondly, a person would fall outside the ambit of the section if he was an accomplice in some way other than the mere fact that payment was made by him.
What necessitated that caution still be exercised was not elaborated upon by the judge. In any event, after the 1976 amendments, no warning was required; it would seem unnecessary that the evidence of a mere payor would have to be treated with greater caution than ordinarily. The role of the warning, particularly in judge-only trials, would have been to remind the finder of fact to be wary. If no warning is necessary, it should follow that there is nothing which would attract more caution than usual.
The distinction drawn between mere payors and those who go further in some way is justified and indeed required by the very wording of s 25. But it is not clear, on the facts of 
 Daimon 
 as reported, what would have amounted to more than mere payment. The judge found that the accomplices there were accomplices `in the full sense`. There was no explanation nor was there anything in the case itself to indicate what this could mean.
Shortly after, Taylor J dealt with the issue again in where the facts were better reported. The accused in this case was a foreman who had received, through two lead workers, money each month from a group of workmen. It was found that the lead workers were manifestly accomplices. In dealing with s 13(3) again, Taylor J said at p 58: 
 
This modifies the law as to accomplices to this extent only - that where there is no reason for calling a man an accomplice excepting the fact that he paid a bribe the court may, in its discretion and if in the circumstances it feels it is safe to do so, act on his evidence without corroboration. ... it is necessary, in any case where this subsection is applied, that magistrate should clearly state which of the witnesses he considers to be accomplices and why, and which of those witnesses he considers to be within the subsection. The section does not abrogate the established practice nor does it apply to accomplices generally; it simply defines particular class of accomplice whose complicity is not serious enough necessarily to raise a presumption of discredit.
 
 
 
He then characterised 
 Daimon 
 as dealing only with volunteers, in contrast with the case before him, where he regarded the workers as being under pressure. It was stated at p 58: 
 
A man who becomes an accomplice only under pressure is less seriously discredited than a man who becomes an accomplice voluntarily. The workmen in this case paid under pressure and are within the section.
 
 
 
In contrast, the lead workers (at p 59): 
 
were manifestly not within the subsection because they did not only pay; they actively collected and they exerted pressure in doing so; on their own showing they used the methods of extortioners.
 
 
 
It would appear that the judge thought (at p 59) that therefore the lead workers were not in the ambit of s 13(3): 
 
The only evidence [of the offence being committed by the accused] was that of the two men who certainly took part in it. They did not merely pay; they collected and were therefore not within the Ordinance. The record does not shew that the magistrate appreciated the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of accomplices.
 
 
 
A distinction was thus drawn between active and passive accomplices. Those who go beyond merely making payment of money, such as acting as collectors, are regarded as being outside the scope of the limited exception in s 13(3) to the general rule.
Subsequently, 
 Daimon 
 went up on a criminal reference to the Court of Appeal of Malaya reported in 
 
 [1953] MLJ 23 
. There Foster Sutton CJ, who was the Attorney General introducing the section in 1950, said at pp 24 to 25: 
 
It was contended on behalf of the public prosecutor that sub-s (3) of s 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance abrogates the rule relating to accomplices in so far as the offences referred to in sub-s (1) of the section are concerned, and that being so, even, if the person who pays the bribe is the person who corrupts the public officer into receiving it, he is not now required to be regarded as a person whose evidence is unworthy of credit unless it is corroborated in a material particular. It was also urged, on behalf of the public prosecutor, that the word, `only` in sub-s (3) of the section qualified the word `reason` which immediately precedes it and not the subsequent words `payment or delivery`.
 
 
 
On our view, the legislation in question does not go so far as contended by the public prosecutor. Before its enactment the mere fact that a person had made an improper payment to a public officer would have necessitated his being regarded as an accomplice to the offence in criminal proceedings against such officer under s 165 of the Penal Code, even although he had taken no part in corrupting the officer into receiving the bribe.
We agree with Taylor J, that the effect of the new provision is that, in corruption cases, a person is no longer to be presumed unworthy of credit merely by reason of the fact that he has made, or caused to have made, an improper payment.
If, however, he has taken some more infamous part in the transaction, for example actively corrupted the public officer into accepting the bribe, the new provision does not cover his testimony. To go as far as contended for on behalf of the public prosecutor would, in our opinion, be going beyond the fair sense of the language employed by the legislature. If the person who pays the bribe is also the person who corrupts the public officer into receiving it, then the tests to be applied to his evidence are the same now as before. Not by reason of the fact that he paid the money, but because he played a part in the transaction not covered by the exception provided in sub-s (3) of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance.
A distinction was therefore drawn between an infamous act and mere payment. Whoever attempts to procure the corruption of the recipient of the bribe is therefore outside the scope of s 13(3). Beyond this, it is not at all clear what an infamous act would be. Apparently the Malayan Court of Appeal in this case did not consider that additional caution was needed in evaluating the evidence of a witness who fell within s 13(3).
The next case of note is which involved the appellant obtaining illegal gratification from several persons A, B and C. A, B and C had been arrested by the appellant. After being charged, the appellant had approached A, offering to obtain the release of A and B, as well as a light sentence for C, if A would pay him $200. A then informed B and C of this, suggesting that he pay half, while the other two should come up with the other half. On the issue of whether A was within the ambit of the equivalent of s 25, Syed Agil Barakbah J said at p 164: 
 
Though the word `accomplice` does not appear, this section modifies the law and practice not as to accomplices generally, but only as to a specified class of accomplices so that a witness who is an accomplice only by reason of making a corrupt payment is not presumed to be unworthy of credit. (See ) If however, he has played a more active part in the transaction apart from the bare payment, he is not protected by the section and the ordinary rules as regards accomplices apply. (See ) Considering the parts played in the case by [A], in the circumstances there was no doubt that this action went beyond concurrence, because after concurring, he went to see his two colleagues ... He did not make a report until after [B] had told him that he [B] had already done so. In other words, he was quite prepared to bribe the appellant and negotiated with [B and C] on the matter. In my view, this amounted to an infamous conduct and therefore he was an accomplice in the real sense of the word.
 
 
 
The primary authority throughout then is, and the requirement of passivity as opposed to active or infamous conduct, has been used as the dividing line determining the applicability of s 25. In contrast to Malaysia, the courts in Singapore have not yet really dealt with this provision. The most recent case dealing with s 25 is where it was said that the application of the section depends on the facts of each case. In a number of other magistrate`s appeals this section has been cited, but no detailed consideration has yet been made.
The position under s 25 is clear in discarding corroboration warnings for accomplice evidence. What is less clear is whether there has to be any additional caution in respect of the evidence of a mere payor. One reason for not requiring it has been noted above. Another lies in the character of the mere payor. As noted by Foster Sutton CJ, the payor is only an accomplice simply because he has made a payment to the accused. He takes no further part in the offence committed by the accused. There is no greater motivation for him to lessen his own involvement or magnify that of the accused than there would be for any other prosecution witness. In contrast, a person who goes beyond mere payment, perhaps by procuring the corrupt act, is an accomplice in the full sense, and has all the temptation to present his evidence in a way that is most favourable to him. Such evidence may be at the most half-truths, and caution must be exercised to avoid coming to the wrong conclusion on the facts.
With due respect to Taylor J, it is not necessary then to apply any greater caution to the evidence of s 25 witnesses beyond that practised normally. Where the evidence is simply that of oath against oath, so long as the judge does not discover flaws in the defence, while ignoring the same in the prosecution, and always bears in mind the necessary burden of proof, there is no inherent danger in treating the evidence of a mere payor any differently from that of any prosecution witness. It must be emphasised that in no way does s 25 elevate the evidence of the payor. It does not deem it to be more believable than the evidence of the defence. It does not relieve the prosecution of the burden of proof.
If, on the other hand, mere payors were treated as full accomplices, and required cautious treatment, it would be difficult to establish the guilt of the accused. The evidence of the person who paid the money to the accused is often the best evidence of an offence being committed. To impose any greater burden than normal on the prosecution in regard to such evidence would be to place an unjustified hindrance on the prosecution. The position of the accused is still protected. He remains innocent until proven guilty. Dealing with the evidence of the mere payor at the same level balances the needs of the prosecution with those of the defence. The defence is not placed in any worse position than normal.
It must be remembered that, if it could be shown that the payor had indeed done something more, then he would not be within s 25. In practice then, the battle lines would often have to be drawn at the question of whether the witness in question is a mere payor or an active participant. In determining this, the burden of proof on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt must be borne in mind. Again this may be a matter of oath against oath. There is no presumption that a particular witness is a mere payor. It has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
But what conduct crosses the line is a question of fact. It would be futile to attempt to set rigid guidelines. It is sufficient to say that the decided cases delimit infamous conduct.
Applying to the facts of this case, it was clear that the complainant was never more than a mere payor. The case of the defence was purely a denial of the offence. There was no evidence by the defence that in fact it was the complainant who had approached him. In these circumstances, it must be accepted that the complainant was a mere payor. He took no active part of any sort. Neither corroboration nor caution beyond the ordinary was necessary.
 The non-production of the investigation papers
There is no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code for the discovery by an accused of documents in the possession of the prosecution. Neither is the prosecution obliged to adduce such documents as evidence. The only provision under which documents may be obtained by the defence is s 58(1), which reads: 
 
(1) Whenever any court or police officer considers that the production of any document or other thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code by or before that court or officer, such court may issue a summons or such officer a written order to the person in whose possession or power the document or thing is believed to be requiring him to attend and produce it or to produce it at the time and place stated in the summons or order ...
 
 
 
This section has been interpreted in as being applicable only to the court before which the actual trial was taking place and that an application could only be made after the recording of the prosecution evidence had commenced. It was thought that these requirements were necessary so that the court could determine the necessity or desirability of the production of the documents in question. Documents referred to in the charge could be applied for before trial. There is nothing to show why this court should depart from that decision.
If an application had been made by the appellant at the appropriate time, the judge could have considered whether to make the necessary order. As it was, no such application was in fact made. The judge noted: 
 
The accused in his testimony repeatedly stated he could not remember certain details about the investigations because he did not have the investigation papers against the complainant. At an early stage of the proceedings when defence counsel made an application for the investigation papers, I ruled that he should apply at the appropriate time and I would consider the application. However, although on several occasions defence counsel and the accused kept lamenting the fact they did not have the investigation papers and therefore they were handicapped no application was made for the court to consider. The relevance of the investigation papers was not demonstrated. In asking for the investigation papers relating to PW6 the accused seemed to be wanting to embark on a fishing expedition.
 
 
 
Merely testifying that investigation papers were necessary for the recollection of events is not sufficient to bring s 58 into operation. Section 58 requires a formal application to the court, and determination of the necessity and desirability of the production of such documents.
As it was, since no application was made at trial, it was not open to the appellant to complain of it on appeal, for to allow him to do so would amount in fact to the adducing of new evidence. Section 257 of the Criminal Procedure Code does allow the High Court on hearing an appeal to call for additional evidence to be taken if it thinks it necessary. But it was not demonstrated that such evidence was so required, nor was it asked for. The investigation papers were not referred to in the prosecution`s case except where relevant. In such circumstances, if the prosecution had not adduced the relevant portions then there is little doubt that it would have been necessary and desirable that such documents be adduced.
The appellant at various points in his testimony said that he needed the investigation papers to remember certain facts or details. That alone does not demonstrate necessity and desirability. If that were the case, then in every situation in which an accused were to indicate that he could not remember certain details the prosecution would be obliged to produce the documents in its possession. The judge was correct in viewing the appellant`s desire to have the documents produced as little more than an attempt to fish for evidence favourable to him.
For example: 
 
Q: The investigation diary will show the date and times of recording of statements in respect of PW6?
A: That is correct. 
Q: As for the statements recorded, the dates and times will be contained in the statements of PW6 in the files of PW6? 
A: I agree. 
Q: There would be no mistake of whether he was there or not there at the CCD because of this system of recording in the station diary? 
A: Yes. The investigation diary records the events in relation to the investigation. 
Q: By looking at the dates of statements, it can be determined where you were at the CCD when PW6`s statements were recorded? 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
The prosecution`s case was that gratification was asked for and that payments were made. These would not have been recorded in the investigation papers. Various minor details, such as where the conversations occurred and which particular matters involving the complainant were being discussed at the time of the request for gratification, were irrelevant. The credibility of the complainant would not have been adversely affected if indeed his recollection of these particular details was faulty. Neither would that of the appellant. What was important was the fact of gratification.
It was raised in the petition that the investigation papers were necessary to show that the appellant had not in fact refrained from prosecuting the complainant. This is not a necessary part of the prosecution`s case, for they are entitled to rely upon s 9 of the Act, which states that an offence may be committed notwithstanding that the purpose of the gratification was not carried out. But whatever the relevance or otherwise, no application was made.
Section 58 only operates where there is an indication of relevancy. In any event, the burden of proof was on the prosecution; the failure to recollect precise facts would not have operated to the appellant`s disadvantage.
 The evidence
 
 
 
 (a) Credibility of the complainant
 
On appeal and below, in addition to the point about corroboration, the complainant`s credibility was attacked by the appellant. No doubt the complainant, as a person investigated by the appellant, may have had collateral purposes in testifying against the appellant. However, the judge was aware of this: 
 
[the complainant`s] evidence in court was consistent and supported by the independent evidence of other witnesses. The fact that he was bankrupt and was investigated for offences was, in the circumstances, irrelevant.
 
 
 
The judge was satisfied with the credibility and credit of the complainant. The appellant`s arguments that the complainant was not a reliable witness were not convincing. In particular, it had been argued that the complainant could not remember a number of details, such as where the hampers were bought. However substantial the purchase may have been to appellant`s counsel at trial, it is not important to remember the place of purchase. Most persons would be hard put to name the place of purchase of items of the same value, especially more than ten years later. The same applies for the other contentions of fact made by the appellant. As to when the appellant`s child was born, it is not material that the complainant could have been mistaken: the birth of the child on another date does not undermine the complainant`s credibility for the information would have come from the appellant in any event, and could simply have been a genuine mistake on the complainant`s part.
Additionally, that the complaint was only made some time after proceedings were taken against the complainant was neither here nor there. The complainant had apparently taken time to consider the matter with his counsel before making representations to the Attorney General. Such allegations would have required weighty consideration on the complainant`s part, particularly since he himself would have been under scrutiny at that time.
Nor would the fact that the complainant did not own the furniture be relevant. There was no requirement under the Act that the gratification belong to the person giving it. Similarly for any difficulties the complainant may have had in obtaining the money.
The prosecution also placed great reliance on various details about the appellant known by the complainant that only someone with some intimacy would have had access to. The judge accepted this. This evidence was, with respect to the judge, inconclusive.
There was an allegation that the complainant`s brother was briefed by the complainant. This was not substantiated on the facts. In cross-examination, the testimony was as follows: 
 
Q: Do you agree that it is your brother who asked you to come to court to say he borrowed $1,000 in 1982?
A: Yes. 
Q: He is your elder brother. Did he tell you what to tell in court? 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
But in re-examination, it was clarified: 
 
Q: You agreed your brother told you to come to court and say you lent him money. Explain this.
A: I am telling the truth. In 1982, I did really lend him the sum of money. When he informed me about this case I have to come to court to testify. 
Q: Are you testifying out of your own volition or is it because what he told you to tell? 
A: My brother never teach me what to say. 
Q: Why did you answer defence counsel the way you did? 
A: He never teach me anything what to say in court.
 
 
 
 
 (b) TBW
 
The appellant made much out of the fact that TBW`s superior, DSP Yap Kiang Keong, did not recall receiving any information about the outburst by the complainant, alleging corruption by the appellant. This was not material. The evidence of DSP Yap was not that he did not receive any such information, but that he could not recall whether he did.
Much was also made of TBW`s failure to note the police gazette which led to the arrest of the complainant, but that would have been evidence merely of carelessness at the very most, which was irrelevant in this instant case.
 (c) Tan
The judge was correct to regard Tan`s credit as impeached by the inconsistency between his statement and his testimony in court. In court, Tan had testified: 
 
Q: Please look at P6 (photograph). Can you recognise this?
A: This is the table outside Ng Kwee Seng`s office. 
Q: Please look at the back portion. Isn`t this attached to the table in the photo? 
A: No. 
Q: When the table was outside Ng Kwee Seng`s office was that piece attached? 
A: No, it was not attached. 
Q: Do you remember how many such tables were in Ng Kwee Seng`s office? 
A: There were four outside. 
Q: The side piece has been taken out in the photograph. The piece is only partly shown in the photograph. ... Look at the photograph. Which is the table? 
A: (Shows the main piece as the table.) 
Q: Can you remember on which side of the table it was? Drawer side or the other side? 
A: On the drawer side. 
Q: When you saw such tables outside was that side table attached to the table? 
A: It was. 
Q: Did Ng Kwee Seng say anything with regard to the table at anytime? 
A: He told me his business had failed. There is nowhere to place the table. If I or my friends wanted the table he could give it. 
Q: What happened after that? 
A: Then I telephoned Tan Khee Koon. I said there is a table. There is no space in my house for it. If you want it I will get someone to deliver it to you. 
Q: What did he say? 
A: He asked me whether the table was usable. I told him it was in good condition. I read in the newspapers and got a transport man to deliver it. 
Q: When you spoke to Tan Khee Koon did Ng Kwee Seng know? 
A: He did not know.
 
 
 
In his statement though, Tan had testified that: 
 
I did not give any writing desk to D/Sergeant Tan Khee Koon. I never did give him anything at all. If he said that I have given him one writing desk then he is not telling the truth.
 
 
 
The judge was satisfied that the statement made by Tan Seng Lee to the CPIB investigator, Tony Sim, was voluntary. He said: 
 
I accepted Tony Sim`s evidence that the statement was made entirely voluntarily by Tan Seng Lee and that what was in the statement was what Tan Seng Lee had told him. In any case there was absolutely no evidence why Tony Sim would want to fabricate evidence and frame the accused.
 
 
 
The judge was entitled to so find. There was nothing on the facts to indicate any inducement or threat had been made to Tan Seng Lee. Though the interrogation took over two hours before the statement was recorded, this was not by itself an indication that any inducement or threat had been made. The appellant had made much of the fact that the complainant could have been in the CPIB building at the time, but there was no evidence whatsoever that this in anyway had caused Tan Seng Lee to give either an involuntary statement or one that was untruthful.
There was also an attempt to insinuate that Tony Sim had received an inducement to frame the appellant. There was no basis whatsoever for this wild allegation. The judge was with respect quite right to reject it.
As the judge was satisfied with the voluntariness of the statement and its truth, he was justified in finding that the credit of Tan Seng Lee was impeached. The judge had also relied upon the contents for the truth of the facts stated, probably relying upon s 147(3) of the Evidence Act: 
 
Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.
 
 
 
This section was considered by the Court of Appeal in 8 which was a case involving offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act. LP Thean JA delivering the judgment of the court said: 
 
It was argued by counsel for Lim that notwithstanding s 147(3) Lim`s s 121 statement is not admissible in evidence by reason of s 122(1) of the CPC which provides:
 
 
 
`Except as provided in this section, no statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation made under this Chapter shall be used in evidence other than a statement that is a written statement under s 141.`
 
 
 
The short answer to this is that Sn S/Sgt Cheong who recorded the statement is a narcotics officer, and it is settled law that a narcotics officer is not a police officer and therefore the admissibility of that statement is not subject to s 122(1) of the CPC; it is governed by s 24 of the Evidence Act: 
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
 , 26-28. It was also urged on us on behalf of the prosecution that the statement is admissible in evidence under s 122(5) of the CPC, and that there is no inconsistency between s 147(3) of the Evidence Act and s 122 of the CPC. No contrary argument was advanced on behalf of Lim. We are disposed to agree with the prosecution.
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal did not deal directly with a situation where a statement has been made under s 121 of the CPC, by a witness who is not the accused. Nonetheless, in view of the disposition of the court to accept that there is no inconsistency in the application of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act, to a statement under s 122 of the CPC, it should follow that there is similarly no difficulty in applying the former to a statement made under s 121 but admissible under s 122(2). In any event, s 122(2) contemplates the operation of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. Section 122(2) reads: 
 
When any witness is called for the prosecution or for the defence, other than the accused, the court shall at the request of the accused or the prosecutor, refer to any statement made by that witness to a police officer in the course of a police investigation under this hapter and may then, if the court thinks it expedient in the interests of justice, direct the accused to be furnished with a copy of it; and the statement may be used to impeach the credit of the witness in the manner provided by the Evidence Act.
 
 
 
Such impeachment is governed by s 157 of the Evidence Act, which reads: 
 
The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him:
 
 
 
...
(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted; 
...
 
 
 
Such proof in turn is governed by s 147 of the Evidence Act, and it is the whole of s 147 that is brought in, including s 147(3). It was possible therefore for the judge to use s 147 of the Evidence Act, alongside s 122 of the CPC. He was entitled to rely upon the truth of the facts stated.
 (c) The confrontation
The prosecution also relied upon the silence of the appellant when he was confronted by the complainant. The judge accepted this contention. Reliance was placed on s 123(3) of the CPC. All that s 123(3) does is to leave the position as it stands at common law, where the effect of silence is dependent upon the status of the accuser with respect to the accused (
[1976] 1 WLR 1251
). It is only if the relationship is equal that the silence may be taken as evidence of the allegation. On the facts, as the complainant was not superior to the appellant, and was actually in an inferior position, the inference from silence was possibly that the allegations were true. However, such inferences are very much dependent on the circumstances. In this case, the judge was satisfied that such an inference could be drawn. This court is content to leave it at that.
 (d) The desk
The appellant`s case and the evidence of Tan Seng Lee was that the desk could not be carried by just the complainant and the appellant as the prosecution contended. The judge was satisfied that this was not true. There is nothing to disturb his finding.
 (e) The evidence of the appellant
The evidence supported the finding of the judge that the complainant`s testimony could be believed, that the prosecution witnesses` evidence should be accepted and that of the appellant and Tan Seng Lee rejected.
It was irrelevant that no disciplinary proceedings were taken or even that, if it is accepted, that the appellant was promoted or given other responsibilities.
 (f) The charges
The judge convicted the appellant on charges of both attempting to obtain the gratification of $20,000 and that of receiving, inter alia, the money totalling $5,260.
Section 6(a) of the Act reads: 
 
[If] any agent corruptly accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal`s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs or business ... he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.
 
 
 
Section 8 of the Act makes it clear that gratification received by an employee of the government is deemed to have been corruptly received: 
 
Where in any proceedings against a person for any offence under s 5 or 6, it is proved that any gratification has been paid or given to or received by a person in the employment of the Government or any department thereof or of a public body or from a person or agent of a person who has or seeks to have any dealing with the Government or any department thereof or any public body, that gratification shall be deemed to have been paid or given and received corruptly as an inducement or reward as hereinbefore mentioned unless the contrary is proved.
 
 
 
Section 9 states that: 
 
(1) Where in any proceedings against any agent for any offence under s 6(a), it is proved that he corruptly accepted, obtained or agreed to accept or attempted to obtain any gratification, having reason to believe or suspect that the gratification was offered as an inducement or reward for his doing of [sic] forbearing to do any act or for showing or forbearing to show any favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs or business he shall be guilty of an offence under that section notwithstanding that he did not have the power, right or opportunity to do so, show or forbear or that he accepted the gratification without intending to do so, show or forbear or that he did not in fact do so, show or forbear or that the act, favour or disfavour was not in relation to his principal`s affairs or business.
...
 
 
 
 
 (g) DAC 01391/94
 
The prosecution had proven that there was an attempt to receive gratification in return for assistance. That would have disclosed corrupt intent. As such, as found by the judge, that charge was made out.
 (h) DAC 01392/94
It was shown that there was receipt of various items and $5,260. Section 8 applied, and the appellant was therefore deemed to have received that inducement corruptly. The appellant did not satisfy this court to the contrary. Under s 9, it is unnecessary for the appellant to have actually forborne to do his duties. The prosecution in fact relied upon a delay in the prosecution of the complainant which the judge accepted as being caused by the gratification received: 
 
I considered as relevant the following evidence that emerged at the trial:
 
 
 
(1) Investigations against PW6 were commenced in 1982 but the accused did not proceed with the charge until March 1987 and after PW6 stopped giving the accused any more gifts and money.
(2) The accused`s supervisor, Cheok Koon Seng, who was a defence witness, found, when he supervised the accused in 1985 in the CCD, that the investigations which the accused conducted against [the complainant] were unsatisfactory, poorly done and incomplete.
 
 
 
It is implicit that the evidence of the appellant that the delay was caused by other priority work was rejected. There is again nothing to indicate that the judge had made a wrong finding on the facts. Nothing was done to show the necessity or desirability of the investigation papers in this respect. In any event, it must be emphasised again that no application was made.
 (i) Double counting
However, an issue arises as to whether there was double counting in charges DACs 01391 and 01392 of 1994. The first involved attempting to obtain $20,000, the second accepting or obtaining a gratification of some items plus $5,260. The evidence in court disclosed that $4,500 was actually in part payment of the $20,000 which the appellant had tried to obtain. 
 
Q: You have testified you have given the accused various sums of money at different times. Why did you give the accused these sums of money and the furniture, and the hamper and the red packet?
A: In July 1982 when I met him he told me about the $20,000. If I give him the $20,000 he would settle the cases for me. All these moneys given by me in various sums at different times were part of the $20,000. As for the hamper and red packet for Tan Beng Wah, I gave it upon the request of the accused. Another hamper and one red packet was meant for the accused. As for the furniture, he requested one set from me after noticing the furniture in my office. I gave it to him as a present.
 
 
 
The evidence disclosed that only $760 of the money was not in payment of the promised $20,000 - these were an initial $200, $500 given for the New Year, and $60 given for the birth of one of the appellant`s children. The furniture and hamper were similarly not intended to be part of the instalment payments.
No finding of fact was made on this, but the way the charges were framed was objected to by the appellant`s counsel in the course of the trial; he did not pursue this in his closing submissions. This was not raised by the appellant`s counsel on appeal. The prosecution were, however, prepared to address the point.
It was argued by them that any attack for duplicity would be based on s 41 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1). That section reads: 
 
Where any act or omission constitutes an offence under two or more written laws, the offender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be liable to be prosecuted and punished under any one of those written laws but shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence.
 
 
 
The prosecution`s argument was that s 41 did not assist at all as it deals with two or more written laws. On the contrary, it must follow, a fortiori, that the prohibition must apply where the offences are under the same written laws. It was noted by the prosecution correctly though that the effect of the provision is that while the same set of facts may establish liability under two or more written laws, there cannot be double punishment for the same offence.
The term `same offence` was dealt with in , where it was considered by Seah SCJ that whether two or more offences were the same offence entails the existence of the same essential ingredients. Regard must be had to the ingredients of attempt and commission to determine whether they are essentially the same. While it is possible to find similarities in the elements, a substantive difference is that an attempt necessarily lacks some part of the actus reus. It is possible then to say that attempts and commissions are separate offences. This may be construing the phrase `same offence` all too narrowly, but an alternative reasoning will be applied.
Though the ingredients of attempt and commission may differ and the 
 Jamali bin Adnan 
 test may not be satisfied, the charges preferred are still defective, as attempt and commission are mutually exclusive, that is that an act cannot be both an attempt as well as a commission of a particular offence.
No definition is given in the Act or the Penal Code of what constitutes an attempt. In the context of s 511 of the Malaysian Penal Code, in pari materia with s 511 of our code, it was said by Ajaib Singh J in that: 
 
Stephen`s time-honoured definition of an attempt is valid and strong as ever today: `An attempt to commit a crime is an act done with intent to commit that crime, and forming part of a series of acts, which would constitute its actual commission if it were not interrupted.
 
 
 
From this definition, it is evident that a criminal act is no longer an attempt when it completes the commission of an offence. The same definition would apply to s 6(a). A single transaction cannot be both an attempt and a commission. Similarly neither could a single act be both an agreement to accept and acceptance.
Attempts and commissions thus cannot overlap. A person who attempts to commit murder logically cannot be charged with murder as well. Either he completed the act or he did not. There can be no intermediate state. It may be argued that provisions of the CPC actually recognise the possibility that attempts and commissions may be charged separately. Such an argument is seen to be misconceived once the provisions are examined closely.
Section 170(2) of the CPC states that acts constituting offences under separate definitions of law may form separate charges at the same trial against the accused. Illustration (g) to that section states that where A wrongfully strikes B with a cane, A may be separately charged with and convicted of offences for voluntarily causing hurt as well as assault or using criminal force. The elements of such offences are clearly different. In contrast, attempts are only incomplete commissions. To charge for both attempt and commission of the same offence is to allege at one and the same time that the acts were both incomplete and complete. The same reasoning applies to s 170(3).
The distinction between attempts and commissions is reinforced by s 174 of the CPC, which reads: 
 
When the accused is charged with an offence, he may be convicted of having attempted to commit that offence or of having abetted the commission of that offence, although neither the attempt nor the abetment is separately charged.
 
 
 
This distinguishes between attempts and the actual commission of the offence. The section envisages that a charge may be for either the attempt or the commission. It clearly precludes charges for both in respect of the same transaction.
Difficulties arise where the attempt is in respect of a series of acts, the commission of each of which is the same offence as the attempt in its own right. It is necessary then to closely analyse the content of the charges. If part of the series of acts attempted has been completed, and each of the completed acts amounts to a separate act of commission of the same offence, it cannot be said that there was an attempt to do those acts. The attempt was made and seen through. It is only in respect of the uncommitted acts that it could still be said that there was an attempt.
Suppose then that W is an offence. W consists of a series of elements X, Y and Z, each of which is an offence as well under the same section as W. If W were attempted, and completion only reached up to stage X, there cannot be separate charges of an offence of attempt at W and commission of X, for W would include X. The charges would appear in the following form:
 
 
Charge 1: Attempting to commit W = attempting to commit X, Y and Z (but as X has been completed, it cannot be said that there is an attempt to commit X, so therefore...) = committing X and attempting at Y and Z. 
 
Charge 2: Committing X.
  
 
 
From the above, it is clear that there has been a double counting of X. It flows simply from the definition of W, as well as the mutual exclusion between an attempt and a commission.
Alternatively,
 
 
Either 
 
W solely is seen as an attempt without any regard to X, Y and Z 
 
or W is disregarded and a charge of commission of X is made alongside with those for the attempts at Y and Z.
  
 
 
W is a composite of X, Y and Z. Either W has to be considered or alternatively, X, Y and Z. But W, X, Y and Z cannot be considered together at the same time, for that would amount to double counting.
Applying this to the facts of the appeal, the request for $20,000 was partially completed, in that there was a payment of $4,500. The appellant could not then be said to have attempted to obtain $20,000. Either of one of two sets of charges should have been preferred:
 
 
(1) 1st charge: Attempting to obtain $15,500 and 
 
2nd charge: Obtaining $4,500
  
 
 
or
 
 
(2) Attempting to obtain $20,000 (that is, there was no completion of the commission of the offence until all $20,000 was received).
  
 
 
The shortcoming of the first is of course that it cannot be said that the appellant ever intended to obtain $15,500. His agreement with the complainant was for $20,000. That would leave the second alternative, proceeding solely on the charge for attempt. It was contended by the prosecution in the arguments on appeal that to do so would deprive them of the opportunity to obtain a penalty under s 13 of the Act, which reads: 
 
Where a court convicts any person of an offence committed by the acceptance of any gratification in contravention of any provision of this Act, then, if that gratification is a sum of money or if the value of that gratification can be assessed, the court shall, in addition to imposing on that person any other punishment, order him to pay as a penalty, within such time as may be specified in the order, a sum which is equal to the amount of that gratification or is, in the opinion of the court, the value of that gratification, and any such penalty shall be recoverable as a fine.
 
 
 
The failure to obtain such a penalty is no answer to the double counting. Parliament, if it so desired, could amend s 13 so that it allowed the imposition of a penalty upon any amount actually received in furtherance of an attempt to obtain gratification.
It cannot be said that the position adopted is overly favourable to the accused. He would still be punished for the crime. What it does is to avoid the clear injustice of prosecuting or punishing him twice for a single crime. The injustice of the framing of the charges is evident if the instalments had say reached up to $19,000. In that case, a charge for an attempt to obtain $20,000 coupled with one for actually receiving $19,000 is clearly unjust. The same should apply whatever the instalments received.
Some additional points will be dealt with. It was argued by the prosecution that account may be had of such double counting at the sentencing stage. The fault lies in the charges themselves, and should be dealt with in the trial on the merits. If anything, it is the receipt of money that may be taken into account at the sentencing stage for a conviction of attempting to obtain gratification; such receipt would be a relevant consideration for determining the severity of sentence. Another argument raised was that the attempt and the separate instalments were separate transactions occurring at different times. This cannot hold. The attempt was one that was spread over a period of time. It was continuous, and therefore was coincident with each instalment as it occurred. There may be constitutional grounds for the conclusion that has been reached, based on implications arising out of art 11(2). These will not be addressed here.
It is noted that in the Malaysian case of , the accused was charged with both agreeing to accept a specific sum, and three charges of actually accepting for himself instalment payments of part of that sum. The issue of double counting was not raised both at trial or on appeal. In view of the above, 
 Ahmad Shah bin Hashim 
 ought not be followed in Singapore.
That being the conclusion reached, it was open to this court to amend the charge.
Section 256(b)(ii) of the CPC, reads: 
 
At the hearing of the appeal the court may ... in an appeal from conviction ... alter the finding ... enhance the sentence.
 
 
 
With due respect to the previous Chief Justice and his decision in the term `finding`, which is not defined in the CPC, is wide enough to cover the charge preferred against the accused. From that it would follow that the High Court in determining an appeal may substitute the charge and convict accordingly.
As it was, however, there was no attempt to challenge the charges in the appeal against the merits of the conviction. The court could not of its own accord amend the charges. They therefore stood.
 (j) DAC 01393/94
The appellant had been shown to have received some items for some other person`s gratification. Section 8 applied as well, as there is no requirement that the receipt must be for the receiver alone - the presumption of corruption was in operation. No evidence displaced that presumption.
It must be mentioned that there are no allegations of corruption against TBW.
 (k) Sentence
Taking into consideration the appellant`s position as a government servant, a deterrent sentence was required. Several cases were cited by the appellant; none were directly relevant. It could not be shown that the sentences were manifestly excessive. They therefore stood.

The appellant in this case faced five charges of criminal breach of trust in the subordinate courts, the first of which ran as follows: 
 
You, Carl Elias s/o Jack Moses Elias, NRIC No 1475884/D, are charged that you, on or about 23 October 1989, in Singapore, being entrusted with property, namely, 2,000 Overseas Union Bank Warrant 1994 for the purpose of delivering these warrants on behalf of Trans-Pacific Credit Pte Ltd (`the company`) to DBS Securities Pte Ltd pursuant to a sale (per contract number 414270/501) of the said warrants, and thereafter to pay the proceeds of the said sale to the company, did dishonestly misappropriate the said proceeds, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed).`
 
 
 
The other four charges were virtually identical save for the property alleged to have been entrusted to the appellant and the contract numbers. These were contract number 14761/91, being in respect of 10,000 Inter-Pacific Industrial Group Bhd shares; contract number 14762/91, being in respect of 12,000 North Borneo Timber shares; contract number 14763/91, being in respect of 92,000 Keppel Investment Warrants 1991; and contract number 14764/91, being in respect of 101,000 Straits Settlements Warrant 1994. The appellant was convicted of all five charges and sentenced to a total of 34 months` imprisonment, in addition to which he was ordered to pay the prosecution`s costs of $26,963.66. The present appeal was brought against both conviction and sentence.
Having heard the submissions of the deputy public prosecutor and counsel for the appellant, I allowed the appeal and now set out my reasons therefor in the following grounds.
 The facts
The facts of this case centred mainly on the appellant`s dealings with two financial institutions, DBS Securities Pte Ltd (`DBS Securities`) and Trans-Pacific Credit Pte Ltd (`TPC`). In August 1988 the appellant first opened a securities trading account with DBS Securities, which account was activated in August 1989. At the same time he also issued a standing order to DBS Securities which authorised them to debit directly from his DBS bank account the moneys paid for the purchase of shares and to credit directly to the same account moneys accruing from the sale of shares.
To further facilitate his dealings in the stock market, the appellant entered into a share-financing arrangement with TPC whereby he was granted an initial credit limit of $100,000, to be secured by stocks and shares deposited with TPC. The exact terms of this arrangement and in particular the status of the shares so deposited were much in dispute in the court below. At this stage, however, it is only necessary to point out, first, that a quantity of stocks and shares was deposited by the appellant pursuant to the arrangement; and, secondly, that these shares were not negligible in value, amounting to about $600,000 in value prior to 16 October 1989. It was further conceded in cross-examination by the appellant that whilst all 
 `withdrawals deposits pledging and sales were done only upon [his] request` 
, this was 
 `subjected to the approval of the Trans-Pacific Credit`. 
On 16 October 1989, the appellant sold through DBS Securities a number of stocks and shares deposited with TPC. These were: 2,000 OUB Warrants 1994 for a sum of S$2,500 vide contract note numbered 414270/501; 10,000 Inter-Pacific Industrial Group Berhad shares for a sum of S$11,000 vide contract note numbered 413142/501; 12,000 North Borneo Timbers shares for a sum of S$12,100 vide contract notes numbered 413124/501 and 413125/501; 92,000 Keppel Investment Warrants 1991 for a sum of S$131,420 vide contract notes numbered 414182/501, 414176/501, 414178/501, 414179/501 and 415507/502; and 101,000 Straits Steamship Warrant 1994 for a sum of S$102,210 vide contract notes numbered 414292/501, 414307/503, 414295/501, 414289/501.
On 23 October 1989 the appellant went to TPC`s office premises to collect the scrip for the warrants and shares he had sold on 16 October. It appeared to have been TPC`s practice in some cases to allow clients who had sold shares pledged with TPC to collect the share scrip personally for delivery to the stockbroking house. At the trial Choo Lee Lee (PW9), a credit marketing manager at TPC, testified that, in such cases, a cover note would be attached to the share scrip, directing the stockbroking house to `(k)indly arrange for the sale proceeds to be paid to Trans-Pacific Credit Pte Ltd`. The client would be required to acknowledge one copy of this cover note, which copy would be retained in TPC`s files. He would then be given two copies of the cover note to hand over to the stockbroking house together with the share scrip. The stockbroking house would acknowledge receipt on one copy, return this to TPC and credit the sale proceeds to TPC pursuant to the directions on the cover note.
The TPC officer who attended to the appellant on 23 October 1989 was Esmond Ng Lai Huat (PW5). At the trial, unfortunately, he was unable to recall whether he had given copies of the cover notes to the appellant when handing him the share scrip. Certainly the prosecution produced as evidence the office copies of the cover notes which TPC had retained in their files. The office copies of the cover notes relating to the following shares bore the appellant`s signature: Keppel Investment Warrant 1991; Inter-Pacific Industrial Group Bhd; North Borneo Timbers Bhd; and Straits Steamship Warrant 1994. Only the office copy of the cover note relating to the Overseas Union Bank Warrant 1994 scrip lacked the appellant`s signature. For his part, the appellant denied having been given any copies of these cover notes for delivery to DBS Securities together with the share scrip; and, whilst he could not deny his signature on four of the five cover notes produced at trial, he maintained that the cover notes had been addressed to DBS Securities and that he had not concerned himself with the directions contained therein.
What is clear, in any event, is that DBS Securities received the share scrip from the appellant without any accompanying cover notes. In accordance with the terms of the appellant`s standing order, therefore, the proceeds from the sale of the five share counters were credited to the appellant`s DBS bank account. This amounted to a total of $258,254. Although on 20 November 1989 the appellant did withdraw $20,000 from his DBS bank account for payment into his TPC account, the bulk of the sale proceeds in the DBS account was employed to pay off various sums which the appellant owed to GK (Stockbrokers) Pte Ltd and Chase Manhattan NA. By 30 October 1989, his DBS account showed a balance of only $1,087.60.
 The district judge`s decision
In the course of the trial below, the arguments put forward by both prosecution and defence concentrated for the most part on the question of whether the share scrip had been entrusted to the appellant. For the defence, it was submitted that the appellant`s sole obligation under the share-financing arrangement with TPC was to reduce his outstanding loan with them as and when he chose to do so. The shares deposited by him with TPC remained his property, both legally and beneficially; and there was no question, therefore, of his being `
 entrusted 
` with them. It followed from this that he was entitled to the proceeds accruing from any sale of these shares; and that, in allowing DBS Securities to credit the sale proceeds directly to his DBS account on 23 October 1989, he was not in any way `
 misappropriating 
` the sale proceeds.
The prosecution, on the other hand, relied on 
 Re Venkataguruntha Sastri 
 in contending that it was not impossible `
 for a person to commit criminal breach of trust in respect of his own property 
`. In 
 Venkataguruntha 
`s case1 the accused had been charged with committing criminal breach of trust of promissory notes he had pledged with the complainant as security for a loan. In citing the case, the prosecution relied in particular on the following passage: 
 
The possession of the promissory, even without endorsement in the hands of the person with whom they were pledged, was of some value to the complainant, as it gave him control over the accused and so long as they remained with him prevented the accused from using them to discharge the debts due by him to other creditors in preference to him. The complainant thus had some sort of beneficial interest in this property and when he gave the notes to the accused for a definite purpose and the accused dishonestly disposed of them in violation of the legal contract that he had made with him there is both entrustment and dishonest misappropriation.
 
 
 
The same reasoning, so the prosecution argued, applied to the appellant`s situation. TPC had some beneficial interest in the shares because they were TPC`s security for the credit facilities extended to the appellant (the prosecution`s contention being that the security was an essential condition of the share-financing arrangement between the appellant and TPC). In handing them over to the appellant on 16 October 1989, TPC had acted with a definite purpose, which was that these shares be delivered to DBS Securities together with the cover notes and that the sale proceeds be thereafter credited directly to TPC by DBS Securities. This handing over of the shares, therefore, constituted the element of entrustment in each of the five charges against the appellant. Having been so entrusted with the shares, the appellant should have known that the sale proceeds were to go straight to TPC: he did, after all, admit reading the cover notes even if he subsequently denied that they were his concern. The element of dishonest misappropriation arose, accordingly, from the appellant`s conduct in first failing to ensure that DBS Securities was made aware of the directions in the cover notes, and then allowing the sale proceeds to be paid into his DBS account for his personal disposal.
The prosecution`s reasoning was adopted in large part by the district judge in his grounds of decision.
 The appeal
On appeal the issue of entrustment of the shares was raised once more. It was again argued for the appellant, as one of the grounds of his appeal, that the shares had been his absolute property, such that in collecting them from TPC on 16 October 1989, he could not be said to have been `
 entrusted 
` with them. Counsel for the appellant argued that the district judge had erred both in fact and in law in finding that TPC had `
 some beneficial interest 
` in the shares deposited by the appellant. So far as the facts were concerned, counsel relied in particular on the terms of the agreement dated 22 March 1989 and signed by the appellant, which agreement, he claimed, did not impose any specific obligation on the appellant to return to TPC the proceeds obtained from the sale of shares. Moreover, whilst cl 9 of the agreement described the deposit of shares with TPC as a `
 pledge 
`, counsel for the appellant argued that there was case law to support the proposition, firstly, that no pledge could be created by a deposit of share certificates; and, secondly, that in any event a pledgee gained no proprietary rights over the property pledged.
Having gone so far, however, it appeared that counsel then found himself hard put to explain the status of the shares deposited with TPC or, for that matter, the reasons for the deposit of such shares. Indeed, his written submissions were somewhat non-committal in this respect; and, upon an examination of the contractual documents, it seemed to me that whilst the use of the term `
 pledge 
` in the agreement to describe the deposit of shares might have been somewhat misleading, it was inaccurate to assert - as the appellant did - that TPC had no proprietary interest at all in the shares. As the prosecution pointed out, cl 23.2 of the agreement specified that the terms of the memorandum of deposit dated 20 March 1989 were to prevail over those of the agreement in the event of any inconsistency between the two; and cl 2 of the memorandum clearly spoke, not of a pledge of the shares, but of a charge or a mortgage over these shares. It might be inferred, therefore, that the intention of the parties was to create an equitable mortgage in TPC`s favour over the shares deposited by the appellant; in short, to give TPC `
 some beneficial interest 
` in these shares.
In the event, however, having regard to the appellant`s first ground of appeal, it did not become necessary for me to make a definitive finding as to the above issues; for the matters raised in the first ground of appeal concerned the validity of the charges themselves and as such touched on the very basis of the prosecution`s case.
It was argued for the appellant that all five charges were `
 bad in law and ... fatally flawed 
` in alleging that he had been entrusted with one thing - shares - but that he had dishonestly misappropriated another thing - sale proceeds from these shares. Counsel`s submissions in this respect were based upon a plain reading of s 405 of the Penal Code, which section is worded as follows: 
 
Whoever, in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use 
 that property
 ... commits `criminal breach of trust`. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Clearly, counsel urged, the juxtaposition in s 405 of the word `property` with the phrase `
 that 
 property` indicated that for an offence of criminal breach of trust to be established, the property misappropriated must be the property entrusted.
The prosecution, for their part, insisted on the validity of the charges as they stood. It was contended that the term `property` in s 405 of the Penal Code included the sale proceeds of goods such as shares; and, as authority, the prosecution cited a number of Indian decisions which dealt with the Indian equivalent of our s 405: , , and . In all three cases it was held that the word `property` in s 405 should not be confined to physical goods: rather, the non-physical cash value of such goods was to be similarly regarded as `property` of which criminal breach of trust might also be committed.
This proposition in itself, however, did nothing to advance the prosecution`s case. In none of these decisions was it suggested that a charge of criminal breach of trust might allege that an accused had been entrusted with one sort of property but that he had dishonestly misappropriated another sort of property. The fallacy in the prosecution`s reasoning, to my mind, lay in the assumption that, since shares and their sale proceeds both constituted `property` under s 405, they were therefore one and the same thing; and that accordingly a charge might specify that an accused had been entrusted with shares (`property`) but that he had dishonestly misappropriated the sale proceeds from those shares (`that property`). Not only did this assumption place a most ungrammatical construction upon s 405, it further demanded a leap in logic which was not warranted by the evidence; for whilst (as I have said earlier) there might have been a case to be made for the entrustment of the shares, it seemed doubtful whether the same could be said of their sale proceeds. Certainly, as far as DBS Securities were concerned, the appellant was entitled to these sale proceeds by virtue of his standing order: there was no question, on their part, of `
 entrusting 
` the sale proceeds to the appellant. As for TPC, their intention was that the appellant should never receive the sale proceeds. These monies were to have been paid directly to TPC; and it is difficult to see how TPC could be said to have `
 entrusted 
` the sale proceeds to the appellant. Of course, it might conceivably have been argued that a constructive trust was created over the sale proceeds the moment the appellant failed to have them credited to TPC. This, however, was never the prosecution`s case, either in the court below or upon appeal. Nor, regrettably, was there any formal application by the prosecution to amend the charges against the appellant.
In this connection, it should be added that some doubts were expressed as to whether the High Court could amend the charge against an accused in an appeal against a conviction sustained in the subordinate courts. It is true that s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), which sets out the powers of the High Court in hearing such appeals, contains no express provision for the amendment of a charge in the course of an appeal. It is also true that in , it was said by the High Court that `
 clearly, s 246 
 [the then equivalent of s 256] 
 gives no power on appeal to alter or amend a charge 
`. However, no reasons were given by the court for this view; and, with all due respect to the learned judge, it is difficult to see that s 256 gives the High Court no such power. In particular, it should be noted that s 256(b)(i) empowers the High Court to deal with an appeal against conviction by ordering the accused to be `
 committed for trial 
`. It seems to me that this must, in the majority of cases, refer to committal for trial on an amended charge; in other words, the power to amend the charge against an accused must at the very least be implicit in s 256(b)(i). Otherwise, the scope of this provision would be so limited as to be practically useless.
That said, however, no submissions were made by the prosecution as to how (if at all) the charges against the appellant should be amended; and in the circumstances, I was not minded to effect any amendments of my own accord.
 Conclusion
For the reasons set out above, therefore, I found the appellant to have been tried and convicted on the basis of charges which were fatally flawed. As stated earlier in these grounds, the validity of these charges formed the very basis for the prosecution`s case; and, having found in the appellant`s favour on this issue, I do not propose in these written grounds to pronounce upon the other issues raised in the course of argument. This should not in any way be seen as a vindication of the appellant`s moral standing. His conduct throughout the entire affair seems to me to have been anything but meritorious. Nevertheless, the charges against him were of a fairly serious nature; and it was the prosecution`s burden to prove these charges. They having been shown to be defective and the prosecution having failed to take steps to rectify these defects, I allowed the appellant`s appeal and set aside his conviction and sentence. The sum of $26,963.66 which represented the prosecution`s costs below and which were paid by the appellant, was also ordered to be refunded to him.

The appellants, Kannan s/o Kunjiraman (`the first appellant`) and Ong Kheng Hock (`the second appellant`) were convicted on a joint charge of conspiring with one Rajendran s/o R Kurusamy (`Rajendran`) to corruptly offer a gratification of $80,000 to one David Lee, the goalkeeper of the Singapore national soccer team. The gratification was intended to be an inducement to David Lee to assist in reducing the winning margin of the Singapore national team in its match against Perlis in the FAM Premier League match held on 13 May 1994, by letting in goals.
The first appellant was also convicted on a charge of corruptly receiving from Rajendran a gratification of $5,000 as a reward for arranging the bribe to David Lee. The second appellant was convicted on an additional charge of corruptly receiving the $80,000 for David Lee. Both of these charges were under s 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
The first appellant was sentenced to one year`s imprisonment and fined $40,000, in default four months` imprisonment on the conspiracy charge. He was sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $5,000, in default two weeks` imprisonment on the charge of corruptly receiving a gratification. The second appellant was also sentenced to one year`s imprisonment and fined $40,000, in default four months` imprisonment on the conspiracy charge. He was sentenced to 30 months` imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $80,000, in default eight months` imprisonment on the charge of corruptly receiving a gratification for David Lee.
The appellants filed notices of appeal against both conviction and sentence. They then applied for leave to withdraw their appeals against conviction. As the first appellant had not set out his grounds for appeal against sentence in his petition of appeal, he was technically deemed to have withdrawn his appeal against sentence. Counsel therefore applied for leave to argue the first appellant`s appeal against sentence. The DPP kindly indicated that he would not make any technical objection on this ground. I allowed the appellants` applications. The appeals were therefore only against sentence.
After hearing counsels` submissions and the DPP`s, I dismissed the appellants` appeals against sentence. I now give my reasons.
The brief facts of the case are as follows. The first appellant is an ex-national player. He was also a committee member of the Changi United Football Club (`Changi United`), in which David Lee is the Vice President and a team member. The second appellant was the President of Changi United. Hence, he was the first appellant`s superior. The first appellant was also an insurance salesman and the second appellant a sales manager with the same insurance company.
Rajendran was an admitted bookmaker involved in `fixing` matches. On the pretext of buying an insurance policy, Rajendran arranged with one Ramu to meet the first appellant. As a result of this meeting, the seed of the conspiracy to bribe David Lee was sown by Rajendran. He made an offer to bride David Lee and the first appellant agreed to pass on the offer to the second appellant, who was in a position to speak to David Lee about this. The first appellant told the second appellant about the offer and asked him how the first appellant should reply to Rajendran. The second appellant indicated that the first appellant should reply in the positive.
Rajendran thought that a goal scored by the Perlis team was deliberately let in by David Lee and was happy with the outcome of the match. The $80,000 was handed over to the first appellant, together with $5,000 for the first appellant as a reward for arranging the bribe. The first appellant passed the $80,000 to the second appellant. However, the second appellant kept the money. It turned out that the second appellant did not communicate Rajendran`s offer to David Lee at all.
I must add that the facts of the present case raised a few questions of law regarding the convictions. It would be appropriate to deal with them here even though the appellants had decided not to proceed with their appeals against conviction. This is because if I had been of the view that any of the convictions could not be supported in law, I would have exercised my powers of revision under s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to set aside that conviction, even if the appellant had not filed a notice of appeal against his conviction on that charge.
The first question relates to what is commonly called a pretence conspirator. This issue does not appear to have arisen previously in any local case. In the Canadian case of , the Supreme Court of Canada held, by a majority, that conspiracy requires more than just an agreement to carry out an unlawful design. To be guilty of conspiracy a party to such an agreement must also have the coexistent intent to effect that design. Taschereau J said at p 2: 
 
I think there has been some confusion as to the element of intention which is necessary to constitute the offence. It is, of course, essential that the conspirators have the 
 intention to agree
, and this agreement must be complete. There must also be a common design to do something unlawful, or something lawful by illegal means. Although it is not necessary that there should be an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, to complete the crime, I have no doubt that there must exist 
 an intention to put the common design into effect
. A common design necessarily involved an intention. Both are synonymous. The intention cannot be anything else but the will to attain the object of the agreement.
 
 
 
At p 5, Rand J agreed: 
 
I agree that a conspiracy requires an actual intention in both parties at the moment of exchanging the words of agreement to participate in the act proposed; mere words purporting agreement without an assenting mind to the act proposed are not sufficient.
 
 
 
was followed in the English case of . This was only a case in the Western Circuit, but it has since been followed by the Court of Appeal in . In , Lawton J said at p 3: 
 
When a man makes an agreement, he assents with his mind to the offer of the other party and communicates his assent to the other party by words or conduct. For the purposes of the law of contract, the words or conduct by which a man manifests his assent are binding on him and the law does not allow him to say that his mind did not go with his conduct. The criminal law, however, is concerned with punishing wrongdoing; the essential element in any crime, other than in the limited class of absolute offences, is a guilty mind. Evidence that the accused person acted and spoke as if he was making and had made an agreement may provide cogent evidence of a guilty mind; but it is only evidence and can be rebutted by other evidence.
 
 
 
It follows, in my judgment, that in the crime of conspiracy there must be the element of a guilty mind ...
If the facts show, as the jury might on the evidence in this case infer that they do, that the defendant manifested his assent to a criminal enterprise, but that his mind did not go with his assent, then it seems to me that the element of the guilty mind is missing and, accordingly, on those facts he would be entitled to be acquitted, and I propose to direct the jury accordingly.
Section 120A of the Penal Code (Cap 224) defines a criminal conspiracy as such: 
 
When two or more persons agree to do, or cause to be done -
 
 
 
(a) an illegal act; or
(b) an act, which is not illegal, by illegal means,
 
 
 
such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy:
 
 
 
Provided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof.
This is not inconsistent with the English and Canadian cases, for `agree` connotes a true intention to enter into the agreement, which in turn connotes an intention to carry into effect the agreement. Had it been the legislative intention to catch a pretence conspirator, the words `or purport to agree` would have been added in the definition. The required for that would then be a mere intention to pretend to enter into the agreement.
Of course once the intention to agree, in the true sense, is proven, the mere fact of agreement would constitute the offence of conspiracy. It would then be no answer to say that the conspiracy was never carried out or that one conspirator or another did not do what he was supposed to have done under the conspiracy.
Hence, the district judge was right in not stopping at the external manifestation of an agreement, but treating it as evidence of a true intention to agree. This, of course, is a question of fact, usually inferred from all the surrounding circumstances. On this, the district judge had found against both the appellants and they have withdrawn their appeals against his finding.
The second question relates to the question of whether the $5,000 was corruptly received by the first appellant. This point was not argued by counsel and hence was not really considered below. However, in the light of my decision in , it is necessary for me to deal with it.
The starting point is . There, I had held that for a gratification to be corruptly given under s 5(b)(i) of the Act, there must be a corrupt element in the transaction itself. The giving of the corruption must also be accompanied by a corrupt intent on the part of the giver. In 
 Sairi bin Sulaiman 
, I held that the same considerations apply in the case of corruptly receiving a gratification.
The application of this test is not always easy, and the present case presents just such a difficulty. On the one hand, if A gives $5,000 to B to assault C, it would have been quite clear that, without more, the $5,000 was neither corruptly given by A nor corruptly received by B. As I have said in , it might have been for an illegal purpose, but that did not 
 per se 
 make it corrupt. On the other hand, the $5,000 here was not for just any illegal purpose. The $5,000 was a reward for offering or arranging to offer a bribe to David Lee. The offer of a bribe is not just illegal but it is also undoubtedly corrupt. The same is true of arranging such an offer. Hence, it could be argued that the receipt of the $5,000 by the first appellant was also corrupt, as it was tainted by the underlying transaction in a way which makes it corrupt. It was a reward for a corrupt act and the first appellant received it knowing that it was such a reward.
In my view, a line must be drawn between a reward for doing something merely illegal, and a reward for doing something which is not just illegal but is in itself corrupt. The latter is corrupt, but the former is not necessarily so. This, of course, is a very fine distinction. However, there comes a point when fine distinction must be drawn and such distinctions are not unknown even in the criminal law. This is just such a case.
As for the fact that the agreement was never carried into effect, I am of the view that it should not make a difference. The $5,000 was given as a reward for arranging a bribe to David Lee. When it was received, the first appellant knew that it was given on this basis. It is not open to him to say that in fact, unknown to the giver of the gratification, the offer was never made to David Lee.
The last question concerns the receipt of the $80,000 by the second appellant. Even though the second appellant was part of the conspiracy to offer a bribe to David Lee, it appears that by the time the $80,000 was received by the second appellant, he had no intention at all to offer it to him. The offer was never communicated to David Lee. It could therefore be safely said that, at this stage, the second appellant had no intention whatsoever to pass the $80,000 to David Lee. Could it then be said that the $80,000 was received for David Lee? Again, this was not argued below.
However, I am of the view that it could. The $80,000 was given to the second appellant for David Lee. When it was received by the second appellant, he knew that it was so given. Hence, he received it for David Lee. It is no answer to say that he did not intend to hold it for David Lee. An agent receives money for his principal, even though at the point of receipt he had no intention at all to pass it to his principal but instead intends to appropriate it for his own use.
As for the question of whether it was corruptly received, is again applicable. There was a corrupt element in the transaction as the $80,000 was meant as a bribe to David Lee. When the second appellant received it, he knew that it was given on that basis and he intended to receive it nevertheless. Hence he received it with a corrupt intent. It mattered not that he then intended to keep it for himself, instead of passing it on. When a bribe is offered to a principal through an agent or some other third party, it is not a defence for that third party, if he receives it knowing it to be a bribe, to say that he had no intention of passing it on but had intended all along to pocket it himself. Had it been the case that he received it knowing that it was a bribe for David Lee, but intending to hand it over to the authorities, then it could be said that there was no corrupt intent accompanying the receipt. However, that is not the case here. Thus, I was satisfied that all the charges against the appellants had been made out. I therefore granted leave to the appellants to withdraw their appeals against conviction and proceed with their appeals against sentence only.
I now turn to the appellants` appeals against sentence. I should say first that counsel for both appellants had criticised the district judge`s findings of fact. In particular, counsel for the second appellant had levelled criticisms against the district judge`s finding that the $80,000 surrendered to the CPIB was not in the house when it was searched. I have studied the notes of evidence carefully, and I must say that I find no reason to disagree with the district judge.
Counsel for the first appellant urged me to consider the first appellant`s illustrious career in soccer prior to his conviction and the impact the convictions had on it. Also, the first appellant`s family will suffer if he is sent to prison. These are of course relevant considerations, but it is inevitable that a criminal conviction will have an adverse impact on a first offender`s career. It is also inevitable that an accused`s family will suffer as a result of his imprisonment. Such sad consequences are unavoidable. On the other hand, the public interest must be protected. Soccer is a sport with a wide following. Offences of this nature have attracted much public attention lately. If left unchecked, they are capable of tarnishing the image of Singapore. All these had been considered by the district judge.
No doubt, in this case, the first appellant was the one who was approached. In this sense, it would be said that he did not initiate the conspiracy. However, he could easily have rebuffed Rajendran. Instead, he conspired with Rajendran and got the second appellant involved. He also pocketed the $5,000 which was given as a reward for arranging the bribe. It was through no credit of his that the intended bribe was never made to David Lee. In the end, I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed on the first appellant were manifestly excessive.
I have also considered the sentence meted out in . There, the accused was only fined $50,000 and no custodial sentence was imposed. However, the facts of that case were completely different and the accused`s involvement there was minor. He also did not receive anything and was motivated by nothing more than a desire to help his friend. I do not see how this case is of any assistance to the first appellant.
As for the second appellant, he too is a first offender. Likewise, there is a strong likelihood that his $500,000 a year (or so counsel says) career in the insurance business will be ruined as a result of the convictions. Similarly, a prison sentence will have an adverse effect on the welfare of his family, in particular his wife, whom the court understands is receiving psychiatric attention. However, the public interest must also be taken into account as well.
I agree with the district judge that, in the present case, the second appellant was more culpable. It may be that it was the first appellant who approached the second appellant. However, the fact remains that the second appellant was the president of Changi United, the football club, and was the first appellant`s superior. He could have brought the first appellant into line. Instead, he went along with him. Furthermore, the amount received by him was $80,000. It is hardly a mitigating factor that the bribe was never offered to David Lee because the second appellant pocketed it instead. I have also considered the fact that the second appellant surrendered $80,000 to the CPIB. However, it seems to me that this was done more to bolster his defence than as a result of any remorse on his part. Similarly, I have considered DAC 6962/95 and I do not see any similarity between that case and the case here. In the circumstances, I am also not satisfied that the sentences imposed by the district judge were manifestly excessive or unduly harsh.
Hence, I dismissed both the appellants` appeals.

The appellant is a 73 year old general practitioner in medicine who has been in private practice for 30 years. He has been a doctor for some 42 years. He was convicted by the district court on a charge of using criminal force to outrage the modesty of a patient, M (`the complainant`). This was alleged to have happened in the appellant`s clinic between 4.45pm and 6.05pm on or about 22 February 1993. The appellant was alleged to have squeezed both the complainant`s breasts and nipples. Accordingly, he was alleged to have committed an offence of outraging modesty punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). On conviction, he was sentenced to ten months` imprisonment.
 The evidence below
The complainant is a director in her husband`s company. According to her, she was approached by her old classmate, Tan (`Tan`), sometime in late December 1992, to take up an insurance policy with NTUC Income. The complainant filled up the `Proposal for Assurance` form (`the proposal form`). In it, she disclosed that she had pneumonia, gastritis, subretinal of her eye and that she had an appendicitis operation in 1977. NTUC Income required her to undergo a medical examination and referred her to the appellant. She was told by Tan that it would be a routine medical examination, meaning that her pulse rate, blood pressure, urine test and the like would be taken.
The complainant said that she called up the appellant`s clinic and made an appointment for 22 February 1993 at 4.30pm. The complainant asked her friend, Chew (`Chew`) to accompany her to the clinic. On the day in question, the complainant sent her son to Neptune Court for tuition at 4.30pm. She then picked up Chew, who lived near the clinic. They arrived at the clinic at 4.50pm. The nurse was annoyed that they were late and allegedly ticked them off rudely, whereupon the complainant said something about making a complaint.
At about 5.35pm she was called to see the appellant. She went into the consultation room. The nurse then took her out to measure her height and weight. She returned to the consultation room. The appellant asked her medical history. A short while later, she opened the appellant`s door to request Chew to telephone the maid to fetch her son from tuition. She then returned to the appellant.
The appellant asked the complainant to remove her jacket, which she did. He measured her chest and waist. He told her to loosen her brassiere and to lift up her blouse to expose her breasts. The appellant used a measuring tape to measure the left side of her chest along the base of her left breast. The complainant testified that the appellant pressed his stethoscope repeatedly in a fast manner around her left breast and nipple. He did the same thing on her right breast and nipple. The appellant then used one hand and squeezed all around the complainant`s breasts, one breast at a time. Thereafter, he cupped both his hands around and squeezed both her breasts. At the same time, he shook them. The appellant also used his hands to squeeze her nipples and asked if it was painful. The appellant used his palm to press all around her breasts, one at a time. After going round each breast, the appellant allegedly pressed his palm on her nipple. This he did to both her breasts.
She was told to lower her Bermuda shorts so that the appellant could see the scar from the appendicitis operation. The appellant told her it was three inches long. The appellant then wanted to measure the complainant`s breast again. He allegedly gestured to her to lift up her blouse again. He asked if he had taken her measurement. The complainant sensed something was wrong and was reluctant to do as she was told. She told the appellant that he had already taken her measurement.
The complainant testified that she estimated the breast examination to have taken about 15 minutes. She felt that the appellant was playing with her breasts. During the examination, she was scared, confused and embarrassed. She was also shocked and at a loss as to what to do because she did not expect the appellant to do what he did.
She left the consultation room at about 6.05pm. Chew saw the complainant`s distressed condition and asked her what the matter was. The complainant complained to Chew that the appellant did a lot of checking on her breasts and that it was not a normal breast examination. She also told Chew that the appellant touched her breasts very firmly, that he squeezed her breasts and nipples and that he had used the stethoscope repeatedly on her breasts. On the same night, the complainant told her husband and Tan. The complainant`s husband advised her to lodge a police report, which she did the next day.
The complainant told the court that she has had breast examinations before, by both male and female doctors. During those examinations, she was asked to lie down and put her hands behind her head. The doctor would then use his fingers to press around the breast in a circular manner.
I should point out that it appeared during the trial that the complainant had some difficulties understanding English. In the course of giving evidence, she asked for a Chinese interpreter.
Chew testified that she accompanied the complainant to the appellant`s clinic on 22 February 1993. She remembered it was on 22 February because it was a Monday and a tuition day. Chew said that the complainant was called into the consultation room at about 5.35pm. She looked at her watch at the time. After about ten minutes, the complainant came out and asked her to call the maid. At the time, the nurse was busy giving medicine to the other patients and was always at the counter.
She went to the nearby coffeeshop to make the call. She took about five minutes. After returning, she sat on the sofa again. Chew said that an Indian lady was talking to the nurse for some five to ten minutes. When the complainant came out of the consultation room, Chew looked at her watch again. It was about 6.05pm.
Chew testified that the complainant looked pale, angry and agitated. The complainant`s first reaction when she saw Chew was to shake her head. Chew asked her why she took so long in the doctor`s room. The complainant told her that the doctor did a lot of checking on her breasts. The complainant said that it was not a normal breast examination. She also complained to Chew that the appellant touched her breasts very firmly, squeezed her nipples and used the stethoscope on her breasts repeatedly. She confirmed that the complainant told her that she felt that the doctor was playing with her breasts.
The insurance agent, Tan, gave evidence that the complainant had called her up to say that she was going to the appellant`s clinic for a check-up. At about 8.30pm on the same evening, Tan received a call from the complainant, who complained about what happened during the examination. The next day, which was 23 February 1993, Tan accompanied the complainant to the police station to lodge a police report. Records were admitted to show that Tan took a day`s urgent leave on 23 February.
Tan told the court that from her experience, the routine medical examination consisted only of a normal urine test, pulse readings and blood pressure measurements.
The investigating officer, Inspector Lim Chew Koon (`Inspector Lim`), testified that the complainant lodged a police report on 23 February 1993. After interviewing the complainant, Inspector Lim telephoned the appellant and asked him to go to the Geylang Police Station. He could not remember if the appellant told him that the appellant had a meeting and could only attend at the station at 10pm. However, he confirmed that the appellant went to the station around 10pm. Inspector Lim told the appellant that there was an allegation that he had pressed the complainant`s breasts. The appellant appeared surprised and said that it was a professional requirement.
After that, Inspector Lim proceeded to take a statement from the appellant. At the behest of the defence, the statement was admitted. After recording the statement, Inspector Lim told the appellant that he wanted to go to the clinic. Inspector Lim testified that on the way to the clinic, the appellant made a wrong turn into Geylang Road against the flow of the traffic. Inspector Lim had to turn on the siren and flash lights of the police car and race ahead of the appellant`s car to warn the other drivers.
I now come to the prosecution`s expert evidence. Dr Alfred Loh (`Dr Loh`), the President of the College of Family Physicians and a member of the ethical committee of the Singapore Medical Association, was called as the prosecution`s expert witness. Dr Loh informed the court that NTUC Income`s medical examination form (`P21`) required the doctor to record a full medical history of the patient. This required a full medical examination, including examining the chest, cardio-vascular system and auscultation of the heart for any abnormal sounds.
Dr Loh opined that examination of the chest is done in four stages. The examination is usually done with the patient lying down. First, a quick visual inspection for any deformity is conducted. The second step is to do a palpation of the chest. This involves placing the hand on the centre of the chest over the sternum and a little to the left to feel for any abnormal vibration. It also involves placing both hands on the lower half of the chest wall with the thumb opposing one another. The patient is then asked to inspire deeply. A close watch is kept on the thumbs to determine equal movement or expansion. This is repeated in a similar manner for the upper half of the chest wall.
The third step involved percussing the chest wall in a systematic manner starting from one side, the right side, from the clavicle to the lowest rib margin. It is done by placing a finger of the left hand on each inter-costal or inter-rib space and hitting that finger with the middle finger of the other hand. On the left side, this is done starting from the level of the fifth inter-rib space and moving towards the breast bone. This would be equivalent to the space about 1cm below the nipple. In doing this, it may be necessary to push the breast away in order to place the finger on the rib cage. It will usually be necessary to do so if the lady patient has a fairly large breast.
The last step involves auscultation of the chest with a stethoscope. The stethoscope is usually placed at specific areas to facilitate detection of abnormal breathing sounds. The places include the supra-clavicle area above the clavicle, the infra-clavicle area just below the clavicle along the lateral sides of the chest cage and along the para-sternum area which is along the side of the breast bone. The breast may also have to be pushed aside for good contact of the stethoscope on the chest wall. The stethoscope is placed sufficiently long to hear the sound of one inspiration and expiration movement. It is not the practice to place the stethoscope around the breast in a circular manner. Neither is it the practice to place the stethoscope on each of the nipples.
Dr Loh said that examination of the breast of a female patient is always done with her consent and, where possible, with a chaperon. The patient is usually requested to undress behind the curtain with the help of the chaperon. She is then inspected for any breast asymmetry while standing up with her hands on her hips. This does not involve physical contact with the patient`s breasts. The next step involves the patient lying down. There is no percussion stage in this examination. Neither is auscultation needed on the breast. Examination by palpation is done in a systematic manner to ensure complete coverage of the breast. This is not done with a flat palm but mainly with the flat surface of the straightened fingers. The fingers are placed over the breast tissue to feel for any abnormal hardness within the breast tissue, with the underlying rib cage as the floorboard. Palpation begins with feeling for abnormality in the tail of the breast located in the area of the armpit. The flat of the fingers are moved round the breast in a large circular direction to cover the periphery of the breast. A smaller circular movement is then made to cover most of the breast tissue. The final stage involves palpation with the thumb and index and middle finger to feel for any lump in the region of the nipple. The nipple is gently squeezed to exclude abnormal secretion. This is done over both breasts. It would take about four to five minutes. There is no reason for the breast to be squeezed in a circular action nor for the flesh to be pulled.
Dr Loh admitted that some doctors preferred to use the palm to palpate the breast during the breast examination. However, the palm is not as sensitive as the fingers. It is unusual to use the palm solely without the use of the fingers. It is not the practice for the breast or chest examination to grab both breasts with two hands. Nor is it the practice to shake the breasts.
In his view, a complete examination of the chest and breasts should take on the average about ten minutes. Even if the breast is not large, there would still be a necessity for some contact with the breast during percussion. The breast examination is not indicated in form P21 but Dr Loh would normally add it under the space for remarks and additional information. The entire physical examination would take about 15 to 17 minutes. The patient would be in the consultation room for about 25 to 30 minutes for the entire process.
Dr Loh agreed that the examination of the breast can be done with the patient sitting in front of the doctor. However, in his opinion, it would not be an accurate breast examination. Nevertheless, he could imagine that some doctors would not examine the breast with the patient reclining. Firm pressure is needed to feel for lumps. He would also feel for lumps in the abdomen and check for scars, especially the appendicitis scar. There is also a need to use a measuring tape to measure the distance from the mid point of the sternum to the apex beat. There is no need to measure the length of the appendicitis scar.
The appellant, on the other hand, told the court that before he examines a female applicant, his nurse would always be there. He would ask the patient whether she wants to be examined by him. He would tell her the nature of the examination and that if she is unwilling to be examined by him she can go to a lady doctor. About 40% of all examinations for NTUC Income are of women.
The appellant testified that sometime in February 1993 he examined the complainant at his clinic. He started the examination after 6pm. He remembered because she was very late and he did not fill up the form completely as he had to check the day`s account. The last patient before the complainant was Aton bte Ene (`Aton`). He remembered this because she was an old patient of his and she came with a small child.
The appellant informed the complainant what the nature of the medical examination would be. He also told her that she would have to lift up her blouse and brassiere and push down her skirt so that he could check her chest for lumps in her breasts as well as her lungs and heart. He had to measure the distance of the lowermost part of her heart from the mid sternum line. He told her that if she did not wish to be examined by him she could leave and be examined by a lady doctor. She said that she was agreeable to being examined by the appellant.
The appellant related the routine for examining the chest. First was the inspection to see if both sides of the complainant`s chest moved equally. He then looked for any visible lumps in the chest wall and other abnormalities. He palpated the chest wall, using two to three fingers to press against one breast in a circular motion. He repeated it on the other breast. He then palpated the complainant`s chest by using two fingers on his left hand and placing it on the chest, using the middle finger of his right hand to tap on the two fingers. This was done for both the lung and the heart. He checked for auscultation with his stethoscope. Just before that, he took the apex beat from the sternum line. If a patient had a pendulous breast, he would lift it up with the back of the hand and feel the apex beat with the other finger of the other hand at the inter-costal space. He measured that point from the mid sternum with a tape.
He then checked on the five parts of the heart with the stethoscope. He auscultated the lung. This was done in the same way as in percussion, from the mid axillary line. Then he looked for enlargement of the liver or the spleen. He also palpated for any lumps in the abdomen. He did not ask the complainant to remove her skirt. However, he did ask her to show him her appendicitis scar.
The appellant said that during the medical examination the nurse was behind the complainant or on her left, a little behind her. To his knowledge, the nurse did not leave the consultation room during the medical examination. He denied that the complainant left the consultation room to speak to her friend.
The appellant denied placing his stethoscope all around the complainant`s breasts. It was not true that he placed the stethoscope on her breasts for about ten times in a very quick manner. He did not use one hand to squeeze one of her breasts before proceeding to squeeze her other breast. Neither did he use both hands to squeeze the complainant`s breasts and nipples. He did not use both his palms to roll the complainant`s breast. He did not measure the appendicitis scar. He denied asking her to lift up her blouse again so that he could take a measurement. He had already taken the measurement.
The appellant maintained that parts of the statement he had given to the police were inaccurate. At the time he signed the statement, he was so upset by the accusation that he could not understand what he was reading. In particular, he denied that para 5 was correct because nobody rang him up about the medical examination. Paragraph 11 was also incorrect because there was no registration of the patient as the clinic was closed. The answer to question 4 in para 13 was incorrect as he did not press the complainant`s breast with his palm. He could not remember driving against the one-way street in the manner stated by Inspector Lim.
The nurse, Selva Kanapathy Anjalai (`Selva`), gave evidence that she would always be present in the consultation room with the doctor when he was examining a female patient. She testified that the complainant went to the clinic on 20 February 1993 at about 5.50pm and not 22 February. A diary was produced. She ticked off the complainant that day for coming in late. At that time, there was a Malay patient, Aton (`Aton`), in the clinic.
Selva told the court that she was in the consultation room with the complainant when she was examined. She was standing beside the couch (which was behind the complainant). The whole medical examination took about 25 minutes. The part involving examination of the chest and breasts took about 10 minutes. During the time, the complainant did not express any discomfort or embarrassment. She denied that the appellant had outraged the modesty of the complainant in the manner alleged.
She said that on 23 February, Inspector Lim called. She transferred the call to the appellant. She then went into the other consultation room to eavesdrop, as the call was from the police. She heard Inspector Lim say to the appellant, `Dr John sometime last week you had a patient by the name of M.`
Selva informed the court that the appellant would not have known when the complainant went to the clinic because he hardly remembers when his patient goes to the clinic unless he looks at his reference card.
Under cross-examination, she explained that the `0` in `20` on the diary was darker because the `0` was originally lighter, so she went over it again. She denied changing it from the number `2`. The complainant had also used the word `complain` when the nurse quarrelled with her. There was thus even more reason for her to be in the consultation room, as she thought that the complainant might complain about her to the appellant.
The other defence witness, Aton, recalled an incident when she saw two Chinese women enter the clinic. One of them told the nurse she was there for a check-up. The nurse `made a lot of noise` because it was already late. Aton remembered this vividly because the nurse sounded angry. She had never heard the nurse scolding or chiding anyone before. Aton could not recognise the two Chinese women. She could not remember the exact date of the incident. She said `probably that day was in February 93.` Aton usually goes to the clinic on a Saturday, usually around 5.15pm. The clinic`s records showed that Aton was at the clinic on 20 February 1993 which was a Saturday.
Next, I turn to the defence`s expert evidence. Dr Sivakami Devi (`Dr Devi`) gave expert evidence on behalf of the defence. She has been a practising doctor since 1952. She is a Ward Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. She had been practising chest medicine in Tan Tock Seng Hospital until 1971.
Dr Devi agreed that a complete clinical examination involves inspection, palpation, auscultation and percussion. Examination of the heart includes measuring the apex beat. Then the stethoscope is used. It is placed over the heart region. This is done in four places. Examination of the lungs consists of inspection to see that both sides of the chest work equally. This is followed by percussion. The stethoscope is used to listen to the breathing. After that, the breasts are examined.
The first stage of the examination is the visual inspection. This is done when the patient is sitting up. The breast is palpated systematically using the flat part of the fingers. This is done over the four quadrants of the breast. She testified that she had advised doctors to examine the breasts in two phases. The first phase is done when the patient is sitting up. The second phase involves the patient lying down. The second phase is unnecessary if the doctor is satisfied with the first phase. All four quadrants of the breast are examined, so there can be no question of gravital force obscuring any abnormality. Conducting the examination when the patient is in a reclining position is not, in her opinion, more accurate.
Lastly, I should mention that the prosecution called Ng Gek Kwee, a senior scientific officer from the Department of Scientific Services, as a rebuttal witness. She testified that the figures `2` and `93` in the date on the nurse`s diary were written over without any alteration with a different ink. The figure `0` showed multiple strokes, all of which were made either with the same or similar ink to the original. She was of the view that there was some evidence that the figure `0` had been altered. However, she could not say conclusively that the original figure was not a `0`. Neither could she say that the original figure was a `2`.
 The finding below
The district judge held that he was satisfied that the date of the offence was 22 February 1993 and not 20 February. The defence`s verbal evidence that it was on 20 February was contrary to credible documentary evidence like the medical form P21 and the appellant`s police statement. Form P21 was dated 22 February by the appellant. The district judge was unable to accept that this was because the appellant had no time to finish filling in the form until 22 February. Filling in the form would not take much time.
As for the police statement, the appellant even corrected the date from 23 February to 22 February. The district judge did not believe the appellant`s explanation that 22 February was typed in by Inspector Lim and not corrected by the appellant. The district judge appeared to take the view that the appellant`s explanation amounted to an allegation that Inspector Lim was trying to frame him up. He did not believe that the appellant did not understand the statement before he signed it. He relied on the fact that the appellant made several corrections to the statement.
Selva`s credibility was, in the district judge`s view, easily impeached. He found that she was very dishonest, unreliable and untruthful. Her evidence in court was materially different from what was stated in her police statement. The figure `0` in the diary had also been tampered with. He disbelieved her evidence that she eavesdropped on the appellant`s conversation with Inspector Lim. She could not have heard the very beginning of the conversation even if she had eavesdropped.
According to the district judge, Aton`s evidence was also incredible. In his view, she could not have recalled the event, which occurred some 21 months ago. Aton said that the nurse was making a lot of noise because the Chinese woman came late for her examination. However, the nurse`s evidence was merely that she told the complainant off rudely. There was no quarrel. Aton could have been mistaken and was referring to another time or incident. In any event, she was not a truthful witness.
The district judge was of the view that Chew`s evidence corroborated that of the complainant`s that the incident happened on 22 February. 22 February was a tuition day and 20 February was not. Tan also said that the complainant told her it was on 22 February. He was therefore satisfied that the incident happened on 22 February.
The district judge held that he was not convinced that the appellant was carrying out a proper and bona fide medical examination of the complainant in the presence of the nurse. The appellant did not impress him as a truthful witness. The district judge did not accept that the complainant had lied to the appellant about her gastritis and subretinal of her eyes. There was no reason to do so as she had already disclosed them in the proposal form. He considered that these conditions were not stated in the form because of the appellant`s lackadaisical examination of the complainant.
The district judge believed the complainant when she said that the appellant pressed his stethoscope all around her breasts in a very fast manner and also that he pressed it on her nipples. He disbelieved the appellant`s evidence that he placed the stethoscope only on five points of the chest. He believed that the appellant used one hand to squeeze all around the complainant`s breasts one at a time and that he then used both hands to grab her breasts and that he shook and pulled them. He believed that the appellant used both hands to squeeze her nipples and asked her whether it was painful. In his view, this could not be examining the breasts for lumps.
The appellant did, according to the district judge`s finding, ask the complainant to unzip her bermudas. The appellant did examine and measure the complainant`s appendix scar. There was no need to measure the scar, unless the appellant had the intention to outrage her modesty and was finding all kinds of excuses or reasons to touch different parts of her abdomen.
The district judge accepted Dr Loh`s evidence that it was not a proper examination. He found that in order to do a proper and accurate breast examination, the patient should be lying on a couch and not sitting down. If the patient was seated, the breast tissue would be gravitated down. It would be difficult to palpate for lumps. He rejected the testimony of Dr Devi that it was proper practice to examine the breasts with the patient sitting down. Her testimony that, when the doctor suspected something abnormal, the patient would then be asked to lie down, suggested that a proper and more accurate examination requires the patient to lie down.
Furthermore, the complainant`s evidence was corroborated by the evidence of Chew and Tan. Chew saw the complainant`s expression when she came out of the consultation room. There was also a later complaint to Tan. Under s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) this constituted corroboration. No adverse inference need be drawn against the prosecution for not calling the complainant`s husband. The prosecution was entitled to do that.
The defence evidence was, according to the district judge, riddled with inconsistencies and untruths. Reference was made to inconsistencies between the appellant`s evidence in court and his police statement.
The district judge held that there was no reason for the complainant to falsely accuse the appellant of such an offence. The insinuation of a fix-up because the nurse had scolded the complainant was too far fetched. The district judge intimated that he was aware that allegations of sexual offences were easy to make and difficult to rebut. He was satisfied that the complainant was truthful. The appellant was not. In evaluating the appellant`s credibility, he had taken into consideration the fact that the appellant had been a general practitioner of over 30 years with an unblemished record. The district judge gave two examples of the appellant`s lack of credibility. One pertained to the appellant`s police statement. The other was that, when the appellant was asked to comment objectively whether the complainant was attractive, he was evasive and said that he did not look at her to see if she was beautiful or not.
The appellant`s testimony was, therefore, in the district judge`s view, unconvincing and had many serious contradictions. Hence it was not believed by him and the appellant was convicted. The appellant was sentenced to ten months` imprisonment.
 The appeal
There are several points of appeal. Most of these concern findings of facts and the inferences drawn by the learned district judge. I shall come to them later.
A main point of contention is the medical evidence. With respect to the district judge, I am unable to see how the court can dismiss the defence`s expert testimony. It will be noted that Dr Devi`s evidence is not contradicted by Dr Loh`s evidence at all. Dr Loh testified that some doctors do use the palms to palpate the breasts. Dr Loh also said that he could imagine that some doctors examine the patient`s breasts when the patient is sitting up. Furthermore, it is necessary to squeeze the nipples. There is also a need when examining the chest to place both palms on the patient`s chest.
The impression from the evidence is that the prosecution initially tried to make much ammunition out of the fact that the P21 form did not call for a breast examination. However, this was debunked by Dr Loh`s evidence. He said that he would do a breast examination and include it under the remarks section. There is also a need to examine the appendicitis scar.
It appears to me that the dispute between the two experts was only about the question of how a breast examination can better be carried out. So long as Dr Loh is unwilling to say that examining the breasts with the patient sitting up is definitely wrong and that no doctor would do that, his evidence does not contradict that of Dr Devi`s. At the highest, it shows that the appellant`s method is not one that was textbook perfect, though I hesitate to say even this. Dr Loh`s evidence can therefore be of little help to the court. He was telling the court how the test should properly be conducted when the patient is lying down. On the other hand, Dr Devi was telling the court what should be done when the patient is seated. There is simply no basis for the court to make any comparison.
Unless the expert evidence shows that one method of doing something is definitely and completely wrong so that no doctor in his right mind would do it in the manner done by the accused, the court would find it very difficult to say that it is certain, beyond any reasonable doubt, that what the accused doctor did was not only medically improper, but was not done bona fide as well. In this case, the prosecution`s expert evidence falls far short of this.
It must be borne in mind that this is unlike the usual outraging of modesty cases. In those cases, it is often simply a matter of ascertaining whether the accused person did touch the complainant, and, from the circumstances, it is possible to infer whether the accused did intend to outrage the complainant`s modesty. But in this case, and this is a crucial difference, the complainant went to the appellant for a medical examination by a doctor. Contrary to what she believed, the medical examination did entail that her breasts and chest be examined. How then is the court supposed to infer that the appellant intended to outrage her modesty from the mere fact that the appellant did touch her breasts, which was the whole point of the examination, albeit in a way which she found objectionable, when the medical evidence is at best equivocal?
I do not see how, barring exceptional circumstances, the court can safely come to the finding that a doctor did intend to outrage the modesty of a patient in such a case. This is totally unlike the case of 
 Ng Huat v PP 
 which I heard recently, where a patient went for an X-ray on his left wrist and the radiographer used the pretext to examine his genitals and anus. In cases such as that, it would have been apparent even to a layman that what was done was not done for any medical purpose. Similarly, where a female patient goes to the doctor to have her blood pressure measured and the doctor, for no apparent reason, asks her to take off her blouse, then I would imagine that the court would be in a position to draw the necessary inferences. In the present case, the court is in effect urged to draw inferences from circumstances such as the fact that the medical examination took marginally longer than normal, or that the doctor used his palms instead of his fingers at certain stages of the examination, or even that he squeezed the patient`s nipples with two hands instead of one. I do not see how any court can say that, if a doctor examines a female patient`s breasts and chest for 10 minutes, then it is a bona fide medical examination, but if he takes 15 minutes he is outraging the modesty of the patient. Similarly I cannot see how a court can say in this case that if the doctor uses his fingers to touch the patient`s breast, it is bona fide, but if he uses his palms, it is outraging of modesty, though it is not outraging of her modesty if he places them on her chest.
Unless Dr Loh was prepared to say categorically that no reasonable doctor would use his palms to examine his patient`s breasts or that no reasonable doctor would examine his patient`s breasts when she is seated, his evidence is of little value to the court. In my view, in a criminal case such as this, which relates to how a doctor should examine a patient, the court should be slow in getting itself drawn into a medical debate on, essentially, which is the preferred way of doing something. It must be remembered that, for the purpose of s 354, which part of the victim`s body is touched is often irrelevant for the purpose of proving the offence. The district judge`s finding comes dangerously close to saying that so long as the examination was not textbook perfect, there will be a danger that the doctor will be found guilty of outraging the patient`s modesty. There must be room for some differences in practice among different doctors.
I venture to add that a criminal court hearing a charge alleging outrage of modesty is hardly the best forum to decide whether one method of examining a patient`s breasts is more medically correct or efficacious than another. Even if it is proven that one method is better than another and ought to be adopted by all doctors, it does not in any way aid the criminal court in the essentially fact finding process which it is carrying out in hearing the charge. Such a debate may well be better conducted before the Medical Council, which is able to put into motion its own disciplinary mechanism.
Linked to the issue of the medical evidence is the question of the complainant`s state of mind at the time of the examination. The evidence showed that, at that time, the complainant was under the impression that no chest or breast examination was necessary. Her impression, clearly mistaken in the light of the evidence, was that there was only to be measurement of the blood pressure, pulse and the like. This impression may well have been worsened by the fact that, in the complainant`s experience, she had never had a breast examination in which she was not asked to lie down. This might have further coloured her impression of the whole examination. In her mind, this was not, according to her experience, a normal breast examination. It was thus no great surprise that her initial complaints to Chew were that the appellant spent a lot of time on her breasts. The fact was that she was not expecting her breasts to be examined at all.
There was thus a very real likelihood that the complainant may have been mistaken as to the nature of the appellant`s examination of her chest and breasts. The district judge did not consider this. He only appeared to direct his mind to the possibility of concoction against the appellant. He rightly dismissed this possibility. However, there remains the real likelihood that, although the complainant did not concoct the allegations against the appellant, her recollection and perception of what happened might have been coloured by her mistaken expectation of what the examination entailed, especially when she was feeling very embarrassed at the time. This might further have been aggravated by her difficulty in understanding English. This ought to have been considered by the district judge.
This case is thus unlike the majority of cases where it is simply a question of who was telling the truth and who was lying. This aspect of the case will in turn throw a different light on the corroborative evidence.
The district judge held that Chew`s evidence corroborated the complainant`s evidence. In the light of s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed), this is technically correct. However, attention must be paid to the nature of the corroboration and the question of what exactly was meant to be corroborated. Section 159 says that the former complaint made by the complainant is corroboration. That may be so, but the fact remains that it originated from the complainant herself and is not independent evidence. Hence, great care should be exercised by the court when assessing the weight of this evidence.
In any event, her demeanour, as observed by Chew, and her complaints to Chew and the others are perfectly consistent with her being mistaken. It has often been pointed out that distress may be due to some other extraneous reasons - see for example 
 R v Wilson. 
 Distress also adds little to the evidence when it is part and parcel of the complaint - see 
 R v Redpath. 
 This is not the normal run of the mill case of molest where the accused denies even touching the complainant. This is a case where the accused had to touch the complainant in the place where she said he touched her. In such a case, it is often a matter of perception. Spontaneous complaints and immediate demeanour after the event are often of little assistance to the court in assessing what happened in a case such as this. They can only tell us what the complainant`s perception of the medical examination was. Even in the normal run of the mill cases, courts should guard against relying too much on this aspect of corroboration, or the lack of it.
I have dealt at length with why it is dangerous, in a case where allegations of the nature made here are directed against a doctor, to treat the case as a simple case of outraging of modesty. I have also said why, in the circumstances of this case, it is even more dangerous to do so here. I shall turn briefly to deal with some of the other findings the learned district judge made.
First, I am not convinced that the incident must have happened on 22 February. No doubt the evidence leads to some suspicion, but I do not think that it can be said 
 beyond reasonable doubt 
 that it occurred on 22 February and not 20 February. The appellant`s explanation for filling in the date on the form as 22 February, though perhaps unlikely, is not implausible. While there is no reason for Chew to lie about the date, there is similarly no reason for Aton to do so. It would be quite coincidental for Aton to be at the clinic at another occasion when the nurse happened to rebuke two Chinese ladies for coming in late. Chew could just as likely have been mistaken as Aton. As for the diary, the evidence is also inconclusive. The expert was unable to say what the figure was under the `0`. It could well have been an `0`. If it was altered, why is it that this is the only figure not written over in a different ink? However, because the question of corroboration is not really important in this case, this issue is not really material.
I also have some doubts about relying too much on the appellant`s police statements. There is evidence that the appellant was not really in the right frame of mind when he made the statement. The district judge relied on the fact that the appellant made many corrections on the statement. However, there are also many glaring errors on the statements which were not corrected. Inspector Lim said that the appellant appeared surprised when told of the allegation against him. The incident when the appellant drove into Geylang Road against the flow of traffic is most peculiar. It is pertinent to note that this was not even brought up by defence counsel. The appellant`s testimony was that he did not remember this. This only came out during re-examination of Inspector Lim when the prosecution was trying to elicit more evidence about the appellant`s state of mind. This was clearly not a concocted incident. Given the fact that the appellant is a 73 year old man who had never had this sort of allegation levelled against him, the benefit of the doubt ought to have been given to him, in the light of Inspector Lim`s evidence. Little weight should therefore be placed on the statement. In any event, in the light of the comments which I have made on the expert evidence, this issue is also not very material.
With respect to the learned district judge, there is no basis for the finding that the appellant measured the complainant`s appendicitis scar. Nowhere was it alleged by the complainant that the appellant measured her appendicitis scar. Her evidence was that he examined it. Even if it was true that the appellant told her it was three inches long, this is neither here nor there, for any person seeing the scar would have been able to do so without the need to actually measure it. As Dr Loh`s evidence revealed, it was a necessary part of the medical examination to look at the scar. There was accordingly no basis for the learned district judge to find that the appellant used this as an excuse to touch different parts of the complainant`s abdomen.
It is also questionable whether the fact that the complainant`s gastritis and subretinal of the eyes were not recorded on the P21 form showed in any way that the appellant was lackadaisical in his examination of the complainant (the inference being that he was more interested in outraging her modesty). It may simply have been due to miscommunication because of the complainant`s difficulty with the English language.
Lastly, I come to the question of the learned district judge`s comments about the beauty of the complainant. In his grounds of decision, when assessing the appellant`s credibility, the district judge observed of the appellant that: 
 
It was obvious that PW6 [the complainant] was beautiful but the accused would not admit it.
 
 
 
Earlier on, when he found that the appellant`s intention was not to conduct a medical examination but to outrage the complainant`s modesty, the district judge said: 
 
The accused thought that PW6 was sent to his clinic for the first time by NTUC Income for a medical examination and in all probability she would not return to him as a patient as she was a one-off beautiful patient. He therefore decided to take undue advantage and outraged her modesty under the pretext of a medical examination.
 
 
 
With respect, this aspect of the district judge`s reasoning is highly unsatisfactory. It is hard to see how the appellant`s answer to the question whether the complainant was attractive can be used as a gauge of his objectivity and credibility. It must be remembered that the appellant is a 73 year old doctor. He must have seen many women patients before. It is therefore not surprising if he pays no attention at all to whether they were attractive or not. Besides, attractiveness is a matter of 
 subjective 
 opinion. In my view, these comments are regrettable. Regardless of whether the district judge had allowed his perception of the complainant`s beauty or otherwise to influence his decision, they may legitimately convey the impression that his findings might have been so coloured.
For all these reasons, I am of the view that the appellant`s conviction cannot stand. Hence, I will allow the appeal and set aside the conviction.

This was an appeal against the acquittal of the respondent in the court below. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons for doing so.
The respondent was charged as below: 
 
You, Teo Lian Seng, are charged that you on or about 1 February 1994, at about 2pm, along Central Expressway 10 km, Braddell Flyover Singapore, did cause the death of a pedestrian, Tan Wei Hong Jamie, m/7 yrs, by driving a motor car SBY 5788Y in a manner which was dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which was actually at that time, to wit, by failing to keep a proper lookout for the traffic situation ahead, and by overtaking a motor car EJ 4395Y on the left lane and cutting across diagonally from the extreme left lane to the extreme right lane and knocking down the said pedestrian and causing his death, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 66(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).
 
 
 
The original charge was one for driving in a zig zag manner, swerving from lane to lane, but at the close of the prosecution`s case, the charge was amended to the above.
 The prosecution`s case
The prosecution`s case was that the respondent was on the Central Expressway, moving towards the city. He overtook a car driven by Eng Buk Kway (Eng) by the left, moving directly into the extreme right lane. Failing to keep a proper lookout, the respondent failed to see the deceased crossing the road. The respondent`s car hit the deceased, killing him.
The evidence of Eng, who was the only prosecution witness able to give an account of the incident, was that he had seen two boys, about five car lengths ahead, walking against traffic along the pavement at the side of the expressway. About four car lengths ahead or 20 m and on the left of Eng`s car was a van, which was just about a car length or 5 m in front of the boys. Though there were errors in Eng`s estimation of distances to the boys and to the van, the prosecution submitted that these were understandable in the circumstances.
At the time that Eng saw the boys, the respondent`s vehicle was not in front of Eng. As the deceased dashed across the road ahead of the van, the respondent cut into the middle lane.
The van braked to avoid the deceased - this was surmised by Eng as the van`s brake lights came on; those of the respondent were not seen to do so. Eng sounded the car horn to alert the respondent of the boy, but the respondent had then moved to the third lane and did not stop. His car hit the boy; everyone else had time to brake. Eng testified that, at the time that the respondent had overtaken him, he was driving at between 70 to 80 km per hour.
The only other prosecution witness who actually saw the incident was the deceased`s companion, who was unable to provide anything material.
The prosecution advanced several arguments on the basis of these facts. The first of these was that the respondent had failed to keep a proper lookout. Although he had a wide field of vision, obstructed only by a vehicle on his left, he did not see the two boys. In marked contrast, Eng could, from a distance, see them walking against traffic. The failure to keep a lookout ahead was compounded by the respondent moving directly and diagonally to the right lane, when he ought to have remained in the centre lane. In doing so, the respondent had to be moving faster than Eng. This was above the speed limit, given that the latter was already travelling close to it. It would appear to have been the prosecution`s case that as everyone else had time to react, the respondent`s driving was dangerous. The prosecution also thought it important that the deceased, who was young, was able to cross the van`s path unscathed. The implication from this was apparently that, if the respondent had not been moving diagonally across, he would have been able to avoid hitting the deceased. It was also contended that the respondent`s cutting into Eng`s path was another dangerous act.
The prosecution sought in the alternative a conviction for negligent driving.
 The defence
The respondent`s evidence was that he was indeed driving along the flyover at that time but could not remember overtaking any other vehicles in doing so. His speed was about 70 to 80 kmph going up the slope of the flyover. Going downslope in the centre lane, he picked up speed marginally. He noticed a car about one length away on the left, going along at about the same speed, which he was slowly catching up with. A child suddenly rushed out, about four car lengths away, entering the centre lane. The respondent braked and swerved to the right to avoid the child. However, he still hit the child on the front left of the car. The respondent did not recall hearing any car horn before the collision.
On the basis of this, the defence was that there was no evidence that the respondent failed to keep a proper lookout. The deceased was not expected to be on the highway; what he did was in violation of traffic rules. Neither was there evidence that the two boys had been on the road for some time. In any event, the van or car in front obstructed any view the respondent could have had of the boys.
As for the estimation of distances by Eng, it was evident that he had made a mistake. As he was talking of distances from the descent of the flyover, the distance from him to the van, on the evidence before the court, would have been about 200 m and not 20 m. If the boys were 25 m ahead, as alleged by Eng, in travelling at 70 to 80 km per hour, he would have covered that distance in one second only, far too short a time for the respondent to cut into his path. Given the actual distances involved, there was no proof that the driving of the respondent was dangerous.
The respondent himself did all that could be done in the circumstances. He had swerved to avoid hitting the child, and not merely to cross into another lane as the prosecution contended.
 The judge`s decision
The judge made several findings of fact in coming to his decision. First, he found that the deceased had indeed dashed across the road. This was not in any event disputed. It was also found that it was not ordinarily expected that there would be someone crossing an expressway, as railings were present, preventing crossing. Additionally, as there was nothing to indicate that there were shools nearby, there was no expectation that there would be children near the road, with any resultant danger.
As for the respondent, the judge was of the opinion that it could not be shown that he had been driving at a fast speed. Eng had testified that he had passed the respondent earlier while driving between 70 to 80 km per hour, and upon coming down the slope, the respondent overtook him from the left. The judge found this to prove that the respondent would have been driving at a speed less than 70 to 80 km per hour.
As for the contention that the respondent failed to keep a proper lookout, even if the respondent had seen the deceased there was nothing to indicate that he was going to cross the road. The respondent`s evidence that he was unable to see the boys was accepted as there was a vehicle to the left which would have obstructed the view. This was supported by Eng`s evidence that there was a yellow van to the left and front.
The judge did not find that the respondent had cut into the path of Eng before the deceased crossed the road - Eng`s evidence was that these occurred simultaneously, and Eng could not rebut the respondent`s contention that he had cut into his lane to avoid the deceased. Though the respondent`s evidence conflicted with Eng`s, the respondent`s credibility was not affected by cross-examination. The negligent crossing of the lanes was in any event not material.
There was thus no evidence that the respondent had committed a dangerous act. No vehicles other than the yellow van were in front. The accepted evidence, based partly on Eng`s observations, was that this was about 216 m ahead of him, if the respondent had overtaken Eng at this point, the nearest vehicle was more than 200 m away.
The respondent was therefore acquitted.
 The appeal
The prosecution`s submissions on appeal were primarily factual. First, it was contended that the judge erred in not considering the evidence that the respondent had cut across the path of Eng, or that he was warned by Eng`s sounding the horn. It was thought relevant that the other drivers were able to apply their brakes and stop, avoiding a collision with the deceased and the respondent`s vehicle.
It was also contended that the evidence was that the respondent did not keep a proper look out. The dangerous manner in which he drove was substantiated by the cracking of the tyre rims.
In addition, the prosecution`s petition also stated that the judge had erred by not finding or taking into consideration that the respondent had been travelling at a fast speed, Eng`s evidence that the respondent had moved straight from left to right, that Eng had not seen any brake lights coming on on the respondent`s car, that the respondent should have swerved to the left instead of the right. Too much weight had also been given to the accident occurring on an expressway, the deceased dashing across the road, and nothing alerting the respondent that there was a school.
It was also contended that the judge should not have accepted the respondent`s testimony that his view was blocked, as Eng could see the schoolboys although he was behind the respondent. In contrast to the respondent, Eng applied the brakes and sounded his horn, as did the driver of the vehicle on the left. The respondent on the other hand had driven dangerously by overtaking Eng on the left, not applying his brakes, and swerving right into the path of the deceased.
No attempt was made by the prosecution to make out a case, on appeal, for negligent driving.
 The issues
The issues will be dealt with under the following sections:
 
 
(i) The elements of the offence. 
 
(ii) The dangerous manner of driving.
  
 
 
 
 The elements of the offence
 
Section 66(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed) reads as follows: 
 
Any person who causes the death of another person by the driving of a motor vehicle on a road recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expect to be, on the road, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years.
 
 
 
The respondent was charged with driving in a manner dangerous to the public. The elements of the offence are:
 
 
(i) the driving was in a manner dangerous to the public; 
 
(ii) the degree of dangerousness must be with regard to the circumstances, including the nature and amount of traffic actually or expected to be on the road; 
 
(iii) that dangerous driving must have caused the death of the other person.
  
 
 
It is clear from the wording of the section that that dangerous manner must have caused the death; it is not sufficient to show that the respondent had merely driven in a dangerous way without linking it to the death.
In dealing with dangerous driving, Choor Singh J in 
 Lim Chin Poh v PP 
 
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 159
  said at p 161: 
 
This court is not going to attempt to lay down what is or is not dangerous driving. The question in these cases always is: `Did the conduct of the accused amount to dangerous driving?` And to answer this question the court must consider whether or not the act or manoeuvre of the accused, viewed objectively, involved danger to other road users in the prevailing circumstances?
 
 
 
Elements (i) and (ii) are closely interconnected and will be examined together.
 The dangerous manner of driving
The supposed danger lay in 
 
 
(a) the failure to keep a proper lookout; and 
 
(b) overtaking a car on the left and cutting across diagonally from the extreme left to the extreme right.
  
 
 
These two instances of dangerous driving will be dealt with separately before their cumulative effect is examined.
 Overtaking and cutting
Taking instance (b) first, doing so does not by itself amount to such dangerous driving as to cause the death of the deceased. If such driving had caused a collision behind, and a death had resulted, then there would be no doubt that that would be sufficient to establish liability under s 66(1). As it is, it is difficult to see how that manner of driving alone could be related to the collision with the deceased. Thus, Eng`s evidence that the respondent overtook him on the left was irrelevant.
The only conceivable way that such an act would matter in this case would be if the respondent by so cutting prevented himself from observing the road ahead, so cutting with speed so that he could neither observe nor react in time. It must then be considered whether there could have been a proper lookout or that the respondent was driving excessively fast.
 Fast speed
It must be noted that any allegation that the respondent was driving excessively fast was not stated in the charge. It would however probably not have caused prejudice to the respondent if such an allegation was allowed to form part of the charge, as evidence had been adduced on both sides as to the speed of the vehicles. The respondent would not have presented his case any differently. But it must be noted that not all instances of dangerous driving involves vehicles at excessively fast speed - it is not inherent in such a charge that another accused would know that one of the particulars was that he drove too fast.
In determining whether the respondent was so driving, it must be borne in mind that the vehicles involved were on an expressway, the speed limit of which is 80 km per hour. An allegation of driving at an excessive speed must involve driving above that limit. The respondent`s evidence was that he was driving at a speed between 70 to 80 km per hour. Eng`s evidence was that he was driving at that speed when he was overtaken by the respondent on the left.
The judge found that it was not shown that the respondent drove at a fast speed. He said: 
 
I deal next with the question as to whether the accused drove at a fast speed just before the accident. There was no evidence that he did so. In fact the evidence adduced by the prosecution indicated that he was not driving fast. Eng`s evidence was that he first saw the accused`s car for the first time at Exit 11 of the Central Expressway when the accused`s car overtook his car. He then drove his car from the left lane to the middle lane and the speed of his vehicle was 70 to 80 kmph. As he descended the flyover he noticed the accused`s car which suddenly overtook him from the left. This piece of evidence from Eng would show not only that he was able to overtake the accused`s car after Exit 11 but also that the accused would have been travelling at a speed presumably less than 70 to 80 km per hour which would be less than the speed limit of 80 km per hour on the expressway.
 
 
 
With respect, the conclusion stated does not necessarily follow.
Eng`s evidence was as follows: 
 
Q: When you switched to the middle lane from left what was your speed?
A: 70 to 80 kmph. 
Q: When did you next see the Mercedes? 
A: While I was descending the flyover. 
Q: Whilst you were descending the flyover, you saw this Mercedes on your left? 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Assuming that Eng maintained his speed and that his evidence that the respondent overtook him on the left is accepted, that would mean that when the respondent passed by him, the respondent had to be driving faster than Eng`s speed of 70 to 80 kmph. Assuming also that driving above 80 km per hour is indicative of excessive (and therefore dangerous) speed, it was not proven that the respondent was driving excessively fast. Since the evidence was that Eng was driving between 70 to 80 kmph, it is conceivable that the respondent had passed Eng at a speed above 70 kmph but below 80 km per hour. No other evidence about the speed of the respondent`s vehicle was adduced. It cannot therefore be said that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent drove too fast.
I note, in passing, that the judge appeared to take the view that the respondent could not have been shown to cut into Eng`s lane except to avoid the deceased. With respect, Eng`s evidence was that he was in the middle lane, not the rightmost one. The respondent cutting into his lane could not therefore have been in response to the child. It would have been more appropriate to reject Eng`s evidence entirely if the judge so desired.
 Keeping a lookout
The failure to keep a proper lookout was possibly occasioned by:
 
 
(i) swerving out to the other lanes; 
 
(ii) not paying attention.
  
 
 
 
 Swerving out
 
The first possibility was that there was a linkage between the failure to keep a proper lookout and Eng`s evidence that the respondent had swerved out from left to right. This would not establish any dangerous driving by itself. It would only matter if, by doing so, the respondent had occasioned the impairment of his own field of view. On Eng`s own evidence, there was a van just in front of the deceased. In fact, Eng testified as follows: 
 
Q: The boy would have virtually dashed across the yellow van which would be about one car length from van?
A: I cannot confirm that. When he dashed across, my view was obstructed. 
Q: Your view was obstructed by the yellow van? 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
This would mean that from Eng`s viewpoint, the yellow van would have blocked his field of view of the side of the road where the boys were. It would not have mattered then if the respondent had indeed been keeping a proper lookout for, even on Eng`s evidence, he would not have been able to see the side of the road from his lane. It was not proven therefore that the changing of lanes in the manner alleged by Eng would have resulted in impairment of observation.
As for keeping a proper lookout of the road in front, assuming Eng was correct in saying that the respondent cut into the middle lane, given the time scales involved, that is, a few seconds, no failure to keep a proper lookout could have occurred - there was simply no time. Additionally, the duty to keep a lookout would not be in respect of all possible eventualities but only the probable ones. While it would have been necessary to keep a lookout for other vehicles, perhaps swinging out as well, it would not have been so in all circumstances do so for a pedestrian.
The respondent was travelling along an expressway. Pedestrians do, foolishly, cross expressways. Though the drivers on an expressway may be driving fast, this does not excuse them from keeping an eye out for pedestrians crossing in all circumstances. It would not be fruitful to list all the scenarios in which the driver on the expressway would have to be additionally wary, or even slow down. But some situations clearly call for extra care.
Suppose a driver was travelling along the East Coast Parkway. There are underpasses along the whole stretch. Given such facilities, and the difficulty of crossing three lanes of high-speed traffic, pedestrians are not expected to cross the road. Nonetheless, if the driver sees from a distance a group of picknickers who appear bent on crossing the road, he must exercise some degree of caution - slowing down, being alert to the possibility of having to stop suddenly, and such. It is doubtful however, that that degree of care is necessary where all that is seen is a group of persons walking along the verge. There is then nothing to alert the driver of pedestrians crossing. So long as he keeps a safe distance away from the verge - which he ought to anyway with the presence of the breakdown lane - he cannot be said to be driving dangerously, even if he maintains his speed close to the limit.
It must be emphasised that the standard required for expressways cannot be the same as that for normal roads. While on the latter, especially in housing estates, there would be a need to be alert at all times to the possibility of persons crossing the road indiscriminately, particularly children, or the elderly regardless of whether there are specific signs of their presence, such as schools, playgrounds or parks. And what is appropriate for a normal road would not be for car parks. What constitues danger depends on the type of road. This is recognised by s 66(1).
The degree of observation required of the respondent must be in relation to what is expected along the expressway. Even if the boys were seen, there would have been no expectation that they would have tried to cross. In that regard, there has been no failure on the respondent`s part.
Of course, the respondent, or any driver for that matter, would at all times have had to keep an eye out for vehicles. It may be thought that if he had done so, the respondent would as a consequence have been alert for the possibility that some pedestrian may cross. That is incorrect. The observation necessary in being wary of vehicles, which are moving forward or even stopping, is different from that of a pedestrian crossing into the line of movement. In any event, it was not proven that the respondent was not keeping a proper lookout for vehicles. Eng`s own testimony was that besides the van, there were no other vehicles in front.
There not being any linkage between any supposed failure to keep a proper lookout and swinging out, it must next be examined whether there was simply a failure to observe the road in front.
 Not paying attention to the road in front
It must first be determined what the distances involved were. According to Eng, on his descent downslope from the top of the flyover, the van was about 20 m ahead of him, while the boys were 25 m in front. Eng denied that his estimation was wrong, but the distance from the top of the flyover to the end was measured to be about 216.80 m. At trial, it was assumed that Eng was referring to this distance. But it must be noted that Eng did not expressly say that he saw the boys at the top, but only as he was descending. The distance could then be some value between 216.80 m and 25 m, inclusive, a fairly large range. Additionally, as noted by counsel, if the boys were indeed only 25 m away, Eng would have crossed that distance in one second, which would not have been sufficient for the incident to have occurred as said.
The judge rejected Eng`s evidence as to the distance: 
 
Eng had indicated the distance of the yellow van from his vehicle at that point of time. The distance was about 216 m.
 
 
 
There is nothing to disturb this finding of fact.
Apart from the issue of distance, the judge also accepted the respondent`s version of the incident as true and that the respondent would have been unable to see the two boys: 
 
The version of the accused that he was unable to see the two boys can reasonably be accepted as there was a vehicle to his left in front of him which would have obstructed his view. The presence and the location of this vehicle was confirmed by Eng who said there was the yellow van to the front on the left. In fact the undisputed evidence was that the deceased dashed suddenly in front of this vehicle.
 
 
 
Thus, the finding of fact was that there was no failure to keep a proper lookout to the front. Again there is nothing to disturb this finding.
Even if the children were 200 m away and could be seen, this would not indicate that the respondent had failed to keep a proper lookout. Again, it cannot be overemphasised that s 66(1) states that regard must be had to all `the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road`. As noted above, the fact that the vehicles were on the expressway means that, although pedestrians were seen on the side, there was no necessity in these circumstances to anticipate that they would attempt to dash across. On the other hand, if it were seen from a distance that some people were in the midst of crossing, then there would be a need to stop or anticipate sudden movements on the pedestrians` part.
Although the prosecution contended that the respondent ought not have hit the child, and should have braked instead of swerving, it was difficult to see how, by this act in the circumstances, the respondent had acted dangerously. Some drivers seeing a child straight ahead of them would reasonably brake. Others just as reasonably would not only brake but try to actively avoid hitting the child by swerving either to the right or to the left. Whether this act caused danger to vehicles behind is irrelevant. No deaths were caused to those behind. What the respondent said he did was a reasonable response to danger; it could not be characterised as a dangerous manner of driving.
The ability of the other drivers, only one of whom, Eng, testified, to stop and not hit the deceased, was not particularly convincing. These drivers were in different lanes from the deceased when he was hit. They could not have hit him. As to the contention that the cracking of the rims indicated dangerous driving, this must be rejected for no specific evidence of the probable causes was adduced.
In the event, the judge was of the opinion that Eng`s evidence did not affect the veracity of the respondent`s testimony: 
 
Eng`s evidence would indicate that the accused`s act of cutting across and that of the deceased crossing the road occurred almost simultaneously and he was in no position to rebut the accused`s contention that he cut into the path of his car to avoid hitting into the deceased ...
 
 
 
 
 Conclusion
 
As it was, even on the prosecution`s own evidence, the elements of the offence would not have been made out. Once the respondent`s evidence was accepted, as the judge did, it was even more manifest that no offence had been committed. While the death of a young boy is tragic and the visceral response may be to make the driver pay, the respondent should not be punished unless he was guilty of an offence. On the facts, he was innocent. The appeal was therefore dismissed.

The appellant in this case was charged in the district court with the following: 
 
You, Joseph George John Roland, male/32 years, NRIC No 1541557F, are charged that you on or about 20 September 1994, at about 1am, along Ang Mo Kio Ave 1, Singapore, did drive motor car EM 4309U whilst under the influence of drinks to such an extent as to render you incapable of having proper control over the aforesaid vehicle and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).
 
 
 
The evidence adduced by the prosecution showed that the appellant was involved in a minor accident with a taxi whilst driving motor car (number EM 4390U) on 20 September 1994. The accident occurred near a police road block along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and the police officer on duty, finding that the appellant smelt of alcohol, gave him a breathalyser test. Upon failing the breathalyser test, the appellant was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving. A subsequent blood test showed his blood sample to contain 99mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.
Before the district judge, the appellant pleaded guilty to the charge set out above. He was fined $2,000 and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for one year. The present appeal was brought against the sentence.
 The appeal
In the main, this appeal was directed against the one-year disqualification imposed on the appellant. It was argued by counsel for the appellant that, in imposing this sentence, the district judge failed to consider special extenuating circumstances in the appellant`s case. These special circumstances, according to counsel, were as follows: the appellant had allegedly been forced to drink beer by his friends, who had also splashed beer on him; the appellant was the sole breadwinner in his family and needed to drive in order to make a living; the appellant was remorseful.
Section 67(2) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) expressly provides that a person convicted on an offence under this section `shall` be disqualified from driving for a minimum 12-month period unless the court `for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise`. In this respect case-law has established that the `special reasons` which suffice to excuse an accused from disqualification must be reasons which relate to the facts or circumstances of the offence and not to the offender himself.
Consider, for example, the man who comes home late one night from a drunken party to find his wife seriously ill. There is no-one else around; there are no taxis easily available; even the ambulance may not be able to respond soon enough. The man decides to drive in spite of his inebriated condition, so as to rush his wife to hospital. He is stopped by the police on the way to the hospital and charged with driving under the influence. In such a case, the urgent and critical circumstances leading to his driving whilst under the influence would very likely be considered `special reasons` exempting him from disqualification under s 67(2). Consider, on the other hand, another scenario. The same man, having sent his wife to hospital, decides to drive himself home even though he is still over the limit. He is stopped by the police and charged with driving under the influence. He cannot now say that he was compelled to drive by urgent or extenuating circumstances. Nor can he plead as a `special reason` the fact that his business requires him to drive, or that his invalid wife depends on him to drive her around, or that he has been driving for 30-odd years without any mishap. Such factors would not relate to the circumstances of the offence but to the offender himself.
In this respect, I found myself in agreement with the judgment of Spenser-Wilkinson J in 
 PP v M Karthiah 
 
 
 
[1953] MLJ 52
 . The learned judge held in that case that `no consideration of financial hardship or of the offender being before the court for the first time, or that he has driven for a great number of years without complaint can be regarded as a special reason within these sections.` In the same way, the argument in this case that the appellant`s job required him to drive was not, in my view, a `special reason` which should excuse him from a sentence of disqualification. One would have thought that it was precisely because he was in such an occupation that he should have been more careful about not drinking and driving. A taxi driver knows, for example, that a conviction and sentence under s 67 will hurt him more than someone else who rarely has occasion to drive.
I also rejected as a `special reason` the appellant`s allegation that he was forced to drink beer by his friends. The use of the word `forced` was, to my mind, wholly inappropriate. The facts as related suggested that the appellant met his friends whilst they were in the midst of merrymaking and that he did not refuse the drinks they pressed upon him. He might have felt too embarrassed to refuse or he might have felt some peer pressure; but I did not see how either embarrassment or peer pressure could be said to be some sort of extenuating circumstance.
As to the remorse felt by the appellant, this was again not a factor related to the circumstances in which the offence was committed and did not therefore qualify as a `special reason` excusing the appellant from disqualification. It was taken into consideration by the district judge in his grounds of decision, together with other factors such as the appellant`s first offender status; and notwithstanding the absence of `special reasons`, the appellant received a very light sentence. Indeed, the one-year period of disqualification was the minimum the court could have imposed.
Counsel further argued, however, that the appellant in fact had proper control of his vehicle. Counsel submitted that the appellant had `only 99mg ethanol per 100ml of blood`, which quantity was `not excessive in his individual case to be under undue influence of drink or of a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle`. It was further contended that the limit of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood prescribed in s 70 of the Road Traffic Act was `only a guideline[as to] whether [a] driver had or did not have proper control of his vehicle`. In support of this contention, counsel relied on a passage in Karthigesu J`s judgment [as he then was] in 
 PP v Balasubramaniam 
 
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 822
  in which the learned judge made the following statement: 
 
It seems clear to me that the legislative intent is that those who choose to drink and drive must be prepared to suffer a minimum period of a disqualification of 12 months should they exceed the prescribed limit of alcohol in their blood 
 or
are shown to be otherwise incapable of being in control of a motor vehicle due to the presence of alcohol in their body ... .[Emphasis on the word `or` added by counsel.]
 
 
 
It should be pointed out, however, that the appellant himself pleaded guilty to a charge which alleged him to have been driving `whilst under the influence of drinks to such an extent as to render[him] incapable of having proper control over` his vehicle. Under s 244 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), when an accused has been convicted on his own plea of guilt, `there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence`. In the present case, therefore, the appellant`s plea of guilt precluded him from asserting, at the appellate stage, that he had in fact been in proper control of his vehicle at the relevant time: this was an assertion which effectively denied the very basis of his conviction under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act.
That should have been the end of the matter. However, since counsel ventured to submit a certain interpretation of s 70, I found it necessary to make clear that I did not accept his interpretation. It is difficult, if not impossible, to see how the alcohol limit prescribed in s 70 can be a mere `
 guideline 
`. The wording of the section itself patently shows that it operates as a presumption which must be rebutted by an accused (`
 shall 
 be presumed ...`). In other words, where an accused is charged under ss 67 or 68, evidence that he had at the material time a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood creates a presumption that he was incapable of having proper control of the vehicle. The onus then falls on the accused to rebut the presumption. He may not do so, however, by showing that he has a great capacity for alcohol, since the specific limit set in s 70 is plainly intended to preclude the individual accused from introducing medical evidence as to his personal tolerance for drink. Realistically speaking, therefore, there will not be many cases where the accused can produce evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption. This was what I meant when I said in 
 Ong Beng Soon v PP 
 
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 731
 : 
 
... s 70 creates an irrebuttable presumption that [the accused] is incapable of having proper control of the motor vehicle.
 
 
 
I meant that the presumption was usually irrebuttable in practice, not that it was axiomatically irrebuttable.
The presumption is, of course, a necessary one. As I said, the provision of a specific alcohol limit in s 70 is clearly intended to preclude accused persons from adducing a plethora of medical evidence as to their individual constitutions and tolerance for drink. Without such a restriction, the court in every case involving a s 67 or s 68 offence would be inundated with all sorts of conflicting medical evidence. I do not think, however, that s 70 precludes prosecutions under s 67 or 68 in cases where no evidence exists of the accused`s blood alcohol concentration exceeding the s 70 limit. There may, for example, be cases where the drunk driver caused such a disastrous accident that police arriving at the scene were unable to administer a breath test to him. In such cases, it will not matter that the prosecution cannot employ the presumption in s 70, since they will have an abundance of other evidence to show that the accused was incapable of being in proper control of his vehicle.
In short, the presumption in s 70 is not the only way by which the prosecution can go about proving a charge under ss 67 or 68: it is open to the prosecution to produce other evidence that the accused was incapable of properly controlling his vehicle. This, in my opinion, was what Karthigesu J meant when he spoke of an accused `[exceeding] the prescribed limit of alcohol 
 or 
 [being] shown to be 
 otherwise incapable 
 of being in control of a motor vehicle due to the presence of alcohol in their body`. (Emphasis is mine.) Karthigesu J`s observation provided no support, therefore, for the appellant`s case.
 Conclusion
For the above reasons, I was of the opinion that there were no merits in this appeal. The appeal was dismissed and the sentence imposed by the district judge was affirmed.

The appellant was the managing director of Perita Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd (Perita). He was tried together in a joint trial in the district court with one Chua Kim Soon (Chua). Chua was a technical officer employed by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).
The charge against the appellant was as follows: 
 
You, ... Ronnie Tay Kok Poh ... are charged that you, on or about 13 July 1993 at No 102 Depot Road, Singapore, did corruptly give through one Goh Joo Siang a gratification of a sum of $100 (Dollars One Hundred only) to an agent, namely, Chua Kim Soon, a technical officer in the employ of the Public Utilities Board, Singapore, as a reward to the said Chua Kim Soon for doing an act in relation to his principal`s affairs, namely, inspecting your electrical installation works undertaken by Perita Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd at 102 Depot Road, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
Chua was charged with corruptly receiving the $100. On 13 August 1994, both the appellant and Chua were convicted. The appellant appealed against this decision.
The appeal was originally fixed for hearing on 11 May 1994. However, the appellant had in the meantime filed Crim M 9/95 for the admission of further evidence. This was heard first. After hearing both counsel for the appellant and the DPP, I granted the motion as I was concerned that there might be a risk of injustice if it was not allowed. The case was then remitted back to the district judge to record the further evidence. After this was done on 17 and 18 July 1995, the case came back up again before me on 10 October 1995. I allowed the appellant`s appeal after having heard counsel for the appellant and the DPP. I now give my reasons.
 The evidence at the trial
Although the prosecution called a number of witnesses in the joint trial, only the testimony of one witness implicated the appellant in any way. This witness was Alex Koh (Koh). Koh was a supervisor employed by Perita at the relevant time. He resigned about a month before giving evidence in the trial. The other main prosecution witness, Goh Joo Siang (Goh), did not implicate the appellant in any way. Hence, so far as the prosecution`s case against the appellant was concerned, Koh`s evidence was crucial.
Koh was employed by Perita about four years before the trial. In 1992, he became a supervisor. His responsibility was to supervise the works carried out and to attend meetings. Presumably, some of these meetings were site meetings.
In July 1993, Perita carried out installation and electrical works at a site at Depot Road (the site). Before handing over the works to the owner, there was to be a PUB inspection. Koh testified that he was told by the appellant to attend the testing. Koh told the court that on the day of the testing, he spoke to the appellant in the appellant`s office at Henderson Road. On that occasion, the appellant handed to Koh two $50 notes. The appellant told him to hand the notes over to Goh to give to the testing officer. Koh then went to the site for the testing. When the inspection was almost complete, he handed the money to Goh. This was done in the electrical room. He told Goh that `the chief asked me to hand the money to him to be handed to the tester.`
During cross-examination by the appellant`s counsel, Koh denied that his position was a senior one with heavy responsibilities. He could not remember when exactly the incident in which he handed the money over to Goh took place. He could only say it was in July 1993. He also could not remember at which part of the day the incident occurred. However, he could remember that, on that day, he went to Perita`s office at about 8am. There, the appellant told him to go to the appellant`s office, where the alleged incident occurred. At that time, only the two of them were in the office. Koh testified that he was not told the reason why the appellant gave him the $100, nor did he ask. He gave the money to Goh in the switch room. He reaffirmed that he told Goh that, `My employer instructed me to hand over the money to him.`
Cross-examined by Chua`s counsel, Koh said that the appellant did not tell him the name of the tester when the appellant handed the money to him. Koh could not remember if he knew who the tester would be. However, he admitted that he had met Chua before. He repeated his allegation that he told Goh that his employer asked him to hand the money over to Goh to be handed to the tester. He could not remember who made the arrangements for the inspection. Koh admitted, when asked if he knew that it was an offence to give money to a public officer, that, `More or less I know a little.` Nevertheless, he said that he did it because he was instructed by his employer to do so. However, when asked whether he would rob a bank if his employer told him to do so, he said he would not. The other parts of Koh`s evidence related to Chua and were not relevant to this appeal.
Goh, on the other hand, said that he had been an employee of Perita for about three years. On the day in question, Koh pushed some money to him and pointed at Chua. He understood this to mean that Koh wanted him to hand the money over to Chua. He took the money and gave it to Chua, who took it without saying anything. He was not told by Koh what the money was for and he did not ask Koh. Furthermore, when Koh pushed the money to him no word was spoken by Koh. On this, he was quite adamant. He did not know who made the arrangements for the inspection. The inspection was sometime in the afternoon.
Goh admitted that though he was paid a fixed salary by Perita, he was also paid according to the amount of work done. By this he meant that he had the authority to employ more workers if the need arose. Perita would pay Goh by cheque. He would then pay the workers in cash. He was unable to say if he was a subcontractor. However, he admitted that he made some money out of this arrangement, meaning that he kept the balance of the money given to him. The rest of his evidence related to Chua and was likewise irrelevant to this appeal.
The appellant`s evidence was that Goh was a subcontractor of Perita`s. Goh was paid according to the amount of work done. All the workers were Goh`s workers and were paid directly by Goh. The appellant had no say as to the amount to be paid to Goh`s workers. Koh was the project coordinator and the supervisor for the Depot Road project. The project was under his charge. Koh attended all the site meetings and coordinated with authorities like the PUB. This included inspections and testings. On 13 July 1993, he was not at his office at all. In the morning, he was at a worksite in Marine Parade. He was unable to identify the worksite at the trial. In the afternoon, he called one of his staff, Low Peng Hong (Low) to meet him at the car park of his office. From there, they went to a tender show-around at the World Trade Centre. The show-around was at 2.30pm. After collecting tender documents at the Port of Singapore Authority at Alexandra Road, the appellant went for a game of golf at the Jurong Country Club. He was never in his office on 13 July 1993. He did not see Koh that day.
Under cross-examination, he testified that he stood by the contents of the various statements he had made to the CPIB. He affirmed that the contents of those statements were true and that he had maintained his innocence all along. The only statement formally admitted by the prosecution at this stage was the appellant`s s 122(6) statement made on 16 March 1994. In it the appellant said that he had nothing to say to the charge. The appellant admitted that, at the time the s 122(6) statement was made, he had been told that Koh had made the allegation against him that he had given Koh $100. He explained that he said that he had nothing to say, because, in his mind, he thought the officers wanted him to admit to the charge.
The appellant said that, on the morning of 13 July, he was at a project site at Marine Parade, next to the NTUC Supermarket. He went there directly from home. He could not remember whom he met there, but it was most probably people from the main contractors. He was there the whole morning. He met with Low at around 2pm that day. He said that Koh was a senior staff member. He admitted that there were terms in the contract in relation to the Depot Road site for liquidated damages for late completion. However, he disagreed that Perita would necessarily have to pay them if there was a delay. This would depend on whom the fault for the delay could be attributed to.
The appellant did not have a written contract with Goh for each project. Remuneration was calculated by measurement of the amount of work done. He was paid fortnightly. The supervisor of the project would check the work. Goh was not liable for liquidated damages if the work was not done properly. However, he might not get any further jobs. Perita paid CPF contributions in respect of Goh. This was done because Goh was a self-employed person and he wanted Perita to pay CPF contributions on his behalf for his Medisave. The amount paid was refunded by Goh to Perita. The appellant denied that all the payments made to Goh was for the purpose of engaging workers on behalf of Perita. Cross-examined by Chua`s counsel, the appellant said that he did not know, on 13 July 1993, that the site inspection at Depot Road would be carried out that day. He also did not know then who attended the inspection, either from his office or from the PUB.
Low testified that he arrived at Perita`s office before 9am on 13 July 1993. He did not remember seeing the appellant in the office. The appellant was not in the office when Low arrived. The lights in the appellant`s office were off. He remembered the day clearly because the site show-around that day was the first that he had ever been to with the appellant. The appellant had told him that they would be going for a briefing, so he had kept an eye out for the appellant, as he did not know what the arrangement was going to be. Low`s office was next to the appellant`s. His table faced the entrance to the appellant`s entrance, so he would know if the appellant came in. There was a door bell and there would be a sound if people entered the appellant`s office. Koh`s office was in the other corner. When Low arrived at the office, Koh was not around. However, he was not sure if Koh came in later. Low knew that the show-around was on 13 July because he was told this by the appellant. Thereafter, Low took the file out and checked the date to confirm. This file was actually an exercise book with newspaper cuttings or photocopies of tender notices. The book was admitted in evidence.
 The finding below
The learned district judge held that Koh was just a supervisor in the project, as compared to the appellant, who was the managing director. Between Koh and the appellant, there was therefore a greater interest for the appellant to give the bribe than Koh. The appellant`s explanation that Koh might have been trying to frame him to extricate himself `therefore lacked logic`. The district judge appeared also to have drawn the inference from the following exchange that the appellant was saying he had no interest in the work being completed and that any delay would be blamed on Koh: 
 
Q: Did he have interest in having this work completed?
A: I treat him as a senior staff and he owes a responsibility to his work. 
Q: Was there any reason for him to take $100 from the salary you paid him to be given to the PUB officer for a job done? 
A: As I have said, since the commencement of the project, he is responsible for the day-to-day running of the work and if the project is not completed according to schedule, he will be blamed by the owner, by the main contractor, the architect, by the consultant. 
Q: Put: Your company was the one who will be blamed by all those persons that you have mentioned and Alex would have no benefit from giving such bribe. 
A: I don`t agree because he was the key man.
 
 
 
The district judge then drew an inference against the appellant because the appellant did not dismiss Koh when he became aware that Koh had made the allegation against him. The district judge also drew an adverse inference against the appellant for not alleging in his s 122(6) statement that the allegation by Koh was a fabrication. Furthermore, he did not deny the charge.
The district judge was therefore not satisfied that the appellant was a witness of truth. Furthermore, Low could not be regarded as an independent witness as he was still a subordinate of the appellant. On the other hand, Koh and Goh were witnesses of truth. He held that there were some inconsistencies in their evidence, but that they were minor. If there were no inconsistencies, then the court would be put on guard that their evidence could be tailor-made and fabricated. There was no reason why Koh or Goh should give a bribe to Chua out of their own pockets.
 The further evidence
The appellant gave further evidence that, after his conviction, his new solicitor advised him to locate the witness who was with him on the morning of 13 July 1993 in Marine Parade. The appellant was unable to remember where and with whom he was in Marine Parade on that morning as his table diary only showed the entry `Marine Parade 8am`. He checked through his project list and discovered that the only project he had at Marine Parade was the Faith Community Baptist Church (FCBC) project. The main contractor for the project was OCK Construction Pte Ltd (OCK). He checked with OCK but was told that the persons involved in the FCBC project had left the company. OCK was unable to tell the appellant the whereabouts of these persons.
Sometime in October 1994, the appellant was at a project site in Bukit Batok when he realized that the M & E consultants for that project, OSV Consultants, were also the M & E consultants for the FCBC project. He realized this when he saw the project signboard at the Bukit Batok site. He immediately contacted Yip Mun Kong (Yip), who was the director of OSV Consultants. He went to Yip`s office and related to Yip his problem. They went through the project file but were unable to locate any document relating to a meeting at Marine Parade on the morning of 13 July.
In December 1994, the appellant approached Yip again for assistance on the advice of his solicitors. At Yip`s office, Yip called Cheah Chee Fatt (Cheah) in. Together with Cheah, they looked into the project file again. Cheah was able to locate his 1993 personal diary. There was an entry for an appointment at FCBC at 9am on 13 July. From this, Cheah was able to recall that he contacted the appellant for the meeting on 13 July. Yip was then able to remember that he was with the appellant at the FCBC site on the morning of 13 July.
The appellant`s evidence was that Yip and Cheah were only his business acquaintances. He was, however, a colleague of Yip`s from 1972 to 1975. When they were both retrenched, he did not meet Yip again until the late 1980s when the appellant tendered for some projects in which Yip was the consultant. As for Cheah, the appellant did not know him until the appellant obtained a project in 1989 or 1990.
On the morning of 13 July 1993, the appellant arrived at the FCBC site before Yip. The appellant went there early to check the place personally before seeing Yip. They were there to check the pattern of lighting at the auditorium of the church as there was a complaint from the architect. They did this until about 11.30am. They then had coffee at a place next to the worksite. He could not remember who first recalled that they had coffee together. They left at 12pm. The appellant could not really remember where he had lunch that day. He surmised that it was in the vicinity of FCBC. He was, however, quite certain that he did not have lunch with Yip. At 2pm, he went to his office car park to fetch Low.
There was no entry in the appellant`s diary for a meeting at 5pm at FCBC on 14 July 1993. The appellant thought that he was probably not informed about it. The next meeting at FCBC was on 21 July 1993 at 5pm. This involved the architect, the owner, the consultant, the main contractor and all the subcontractors. He was informed by the main contractor by fax that his presence was required for the 21 July meeting. The fax was dated 9 July. He could not recall if Cheah told him when Cheah arranged the meeting for 13 July that there was a tentative appointment for a joint inspection on 14 July. Most probably Cheah did not tell him about the 14 July meeting. He had testified in July 1994 that he was at a worksite in Marine Parade even though he could not recall that he was at the FCBC worksite because his work involves construction. He attended tender show-arounds, tender briefings, quotation invitations or construction work. So he surmised that he must have gone to a worksite.
Yip confirmed that OSV Consultants were the M & E consultants for the FCBC project and that Perita was a subcontractor for this project. Sometime in October 1994, the appellant went to see Yip and asked if Yip could confirm whether the appellant had a meeting on 13 July 1993. The appellant told him that he had been charged for bribery. They went through the project file, but could not locate any useful document except two faxes which showed that there had been a meeting on 21 July 1993. At that time, all Yip could recall was that he had a meeting regarding the switching pattern of the auditorium lighting in FCBC some time before 21 July 1993. Yip told the appellant that he could not help him. At that time, Yip was relieved that nothing was found as he was not keen to be a witness.
In December 1994, the appellant approached Yip in Yip`s office again. Cheah was in the office, so Yip asked Cheah if he could remember anything. This was because Cheah was the engineer involved in the FCBC project. The three of them could recall that there was a meeting regarding the switching pattern. Cheah located his old diary and found that there was an entry for a meeting at FCBC at 9am on 13 July 1993. There was also an entry for a meeting at 5pm on 14 July, but this had been crossed out. Yip saw the entries. From this, Yip remembered that a day before the 13 July meeting, Cheah had approached him to attend the meeting on Cheah`s behalf. This was because Cheah had another meeting at 10am and he realised that the meeting with the appellant might take longer. Yip agreed and went to the meeting on 13 July.
Yip confirmed then that he met the appellant at the FCBC site sometime around 9am on 13 July 1993. The appellant was already waiting for Yip there. They went through the defects and the switching problems in the auditorium. They left the site at about 11.30am and went to have a cup of coffee at a nearby coffee-shop. They did not have lunch together because Yip had lunch with Cheah. Yip discussed the switching pattern with Cheah over the meal. Yip also confirmed that he and the appellant previously worked in the same company. They were retrenched together sometime around 1976 and lost contact with each other until they met again in 1990. OSV Consultants were then involved in a project at Marina Square and the appellant had been appointed as a subcontractor. Yip said that he and the appellant were not friends in the social sense of the word.
Cheah`s evidence on the whole agreed with the appellant`s and Yip`s testimony. Cheah testified that Yip called him to Yip`s office sometime in December 1994. Yip related to Cheah the problem the appellant was facing. He was shown the two faxes relating to the 21 July 1993 meeting. Yip asked if he could remember any meeting before 21 July. Cheah told him that he had to locate his old diary. This was found. In it were the relevant entries for 13, 14 and 21 July 1993. Cheah explained that the entry for 14 July at 5pm was cancelled because the architect had called up much earlier and fixed a site meeting on 14 July. Therefore he called up the appellant to set a meeting before 14 July to go through all the defects. The meeting was fixed for 13 July. This was done so that Cheah could better answer the architect`s complaint. As far as Cheah was concerned, he had told the appellant about the site meeting on 14 July.
Subsequently, there was another fax from the architect. The site meeting on 14 July had been postponed to 21 July. However, Cheah did not reschedule the 13 July meeting. This was because he was busy with the rest of his work. On 12 July, Cheah asked Yip to attend the meeting with the appellant on his behalf as he had another meeting at 10am. Cheah had initially thought that he could make it in time for the 10am meeting but realized later that he would take some time to go through all the defects. Cheah confirmed that he cancelled the entry for 14 July.
On 13 July, after Yip came back, they had lunch together. Yip then related all the defects that he had gone through with Cheah. Going through the defects for the FCBC project was not a very technical matter, so Yip could do it on Cheah`s behalf. Cheah said that he remembered the meeting because it was not common for a client to complain about defects some six months after the project had been handed over.
The CPIB sent the appellant`s desktop diary and Cheah`s diary to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis. The results were inconclusive.
Defence counsel applied, after all the witnesses had given evidence, for the appellant`s s 121 statements that were made to the CPIB officers. However, the prosecution was only agreeable to letting the defence have that part of the statement that was recorded on 20 November 1993. This was admitted in evidence and marked `D10`.
 The appeal
I propose to deal first with the learned district judge`s findings without referring to the additional evidence. The first issue was the status of the two main prosecution witnesses. As regards Koh, I regret that I was unable to agree with the district judge that Koh was `just` a site supervisor. In my view, it can be taken for granted that it is a fact of the construction industry that a site supervisor cannot be anything but a fairly senior and trusted employee. He is the person relied on by his employer to ensure that the quality of work done by the workers and subcontractors is up to the standard required. He also attends site meetings. The reputation of a contractor stands or falls by the quality of work it is able to deliver. To a certain extent, it is to the site supervisor that the responsibility of ensuring this quality is entrusted. I therefore did not view Koh`s failure to admit to this basic fact of the construction industry very favourably.
I was also of the view that the evidence showed clearly that Goh could not have been a mere `general worker`. It was Goh`s own evidence that he paid the workers out of what he was paid by Perita. Goh was the one who decided how many workers to hire and whom to hire. He also admitted that he made money out of the arrangement. In other words, he retained the excess sums. The payment vouchers conclusively showed that between 20 February 1993 and 21 September 1993, Goh was paid at least a total of $89,500. I have grave doubts whether any contractor in the construction business would entrust to a 
 general worker 
this sum of money to be paid over to the workers as wages. Not only that, the evidence was that it was Goh who decided how many workers to hire and how much to pay them, and he could retain the surplus. Furthermore, it appeared that these sums of money were paid on the mere say-so of Goh. It also appeared that Goh was involved in at least six projects during this period. With the greatest respect, it seemed to me self-evident that no managing director in his right mind would enter into this sort of an arrangement with a general worker. The irresistible conclusion must be that Goh was a subcontractor of Perita`s, albeit he might also be an employee for certain purposes at the same time.
Once it is realized what Goh`s and Koh`s respective functions were, it would immediately be apparent that both Koh and Goh had some interest in the matter. However, it is not necessary for me to speculate on this issue as even the learned district judge`s reasoning revealed that Koh had an interest in the whole thing. The [learned] district judge`s finding was that the appellant had a greater interest in giving a bribe to Chua than Koh. With the greatest respect, regardless of whether this was the case, it appears to me that this completely missed the point. The short point was that Koh had an interest in giving a bribe to Chua. That made him an interested witness. The fact that the appellant might have had a greater interest was neither here nor there.
Since Koh might have very good reasons to offer a bribe to Chua, it was manifest that he would also have a good reason to shift all the blame to the appellant, even to the extent of framing him. It should be remembered that Goh`s evidence in no way implicated the appellant. Whether he had a reason to frame the appellant or not was, therefore, of little bearing. What was highly relevant was that, without Koh`s own evidence, all the other evidence, including Goh`s, pointed to and implicated Koh and nobody else. There was, therefore, good reason for Koh to implicate the appellant, if for no other reason than to extricate himself.
I now turn to the discrepancy between Koh`s and Goh`s evidence. I agree that a number of the discrepancies pointed out by counsel for the appellant were minor. However, I was unable to agree with the learned district judge that all of them were minor. In particular, I had in mind the evidence of Goh that, when Koh handed him the money, Koh did not say anything to Goh. This was in marked contrast to Koh`s evidence that he told Goh that the appellant wanted him to give it to Goh to pass to Chua. Although the discrepancy between the two witnesses as to whether Koh did or did not tell Goh that the money came from the appellant was probably minor so far as the PUB inspector was concerned, so far as the appellant was concerned, it was of crucial importance. Apart from the ability to prove that the appellant was not in the office at the relevant time, this was the only other aspect of Koh`s evidence that could be corroborated or supported by other evidence. Instead of being supported by Goh`s evidence, it was flatly contradicted by it. It should be noted that Goh was asked no less than three times whether Koh said to him that the money came from the appellant. Each time his answer was that Koh did not. His answers were not that he did not hear Koh say this or that he could not remember. They were categorical denials. This must surely throw doubt on the reliability of Koh`s evidence as he was an interested witness.
The learned DPP urged that the discrepancy could have been due to the fact that different people may have different recollections of what happened. That might well have been the case. However, it could also be that one of them was lying. All I can say is that, if that happened on a highly material issue, to the extent that it was capable of throwing doubt on the prosecution`s case, then that was just too bad for the prosecution.
Then, there was the convoluted way in which the appellant was alleged to have instructed Koh to give the money to the inspector. If the appellant had wanted to bribe Chua, why did he not do it himself? Instead, he was alleged to have trusted Koh with something that appeared patently illegal. Not only that, he did not tell Koh to give it to the inspector. Instead, he told Koh to give the money to Goh to hand to the inspector. Why involve a second third party and double the risk of discovery for no good reason? After all, Goh was supposed to be only a general worker and Koh only a supervisor.
Furthermore, there was no evidence that the appellant knew who the inspector was going to be. Koh`s answer to the question whether he knew who the inspector was was most revealing, as he conveniently said he could not remember whether he knew. Neither could he remember whether he was the one who made the appointment for the inspection. He also seemed to be unable to remember quite a number of relevant things that day, including which part of the day the inspection was. It appeared to me even from the records that Koh was being evasive. In any event, it would have been hard to see how his evidence could be said to be so convincing that a conviction could be founded solely on it.
Turning to the treatment of the defence evidence, the first issue was the failure to dismiss Koh. The prosecution made much out of the fact that the CPIB officers had told the appellant that Koh had made the allegation against him as early as in November of 1993. In particular, the prosecution relied on a paragraph of the appellant`s s 121 statement recorded on 20 November 1993. Although this paragraph was read out during the trial, it was, for some strange reason, not formally admitted and marked as an exhibit until 18 July 1995 when the court was recording the defence`s further argument, where it was finally admitted and marked as `D10`. This was even more peculiar, considering the fact that the appellant had always maintained that he stood by whatever he had told the CPIB officers in his s 121 statement. In any event, it read as follows: 
 
18 I wish to say that on 13 July 1993, I did not give $100 to Alex Koh Kia Wan at my office and told him to give the $100 to Goh Joo Siang for him (Goh Joo Siang) to give to Chua Kim Soon, the technical officer of PUB during the inspection at the Depot Road project. As stated in my earlier statement, I was not aware that there was an inspection of the switch board installation at the worksite on 13 July 1993. I also did not inform Alex Koh that I had arranged for the inspection by the technician from PUB on that day. I did not give the said money to Alex Koh and did not instruct him to give it to Goh Joo Siang to bribe Chua Kim Soon either for leniency in inspection or early turn-on date. I also do not have any idea whether there were any defects in the installation during the inspection. No one had told me anything about the inspection and whether there were any defects identified by the technician during the inspection. I do not have any written records on the inspection done on 13 July 1993.
 
 
 
The district judge took the view that the appellant`s failure to dismiss Koh had some bearing on the appellant`s credibility. I was unable to agree. It appeared to me that it was neither here nor there whether the appellant dismissed Koh after he allegedly made the accusation against the appellant. Certainly, no inference could be fairly drawn from this. If the appellant had dismissed Koh, then he would no doubt have laid himself open to the accusation that he was trying to cover something up.
In this respect, and in respect to D10 in general, counsel for the appellant had earlier submitted that the CPIB officers had in fact made a number of other allegations against the appellant. These involved allegations purportedly made by other employees of Perita`s and related to other alleged incidents on various dates. Counsel told the court that these allegations were revealed in the other passages of the appellant`s s 121 statement. According to counsel, this had been read out during the trial. As I have said earlier, the entire statement had not been formally admitted and marked as evidence. This was somewhat confusing as the appellant had maintained during cross-examination that what he had said in the statements was the truth. One would have thought that the contents of the s 121 statement then became part of his testimony and the s 121 statement should have been admitted and marked.
What was even more inexplicable was that, at the end of the recording of the further evidence, defence counsel applied to have sight of the entire s 121 statement, and the application was opposed by the prosecution. In the end, only D10, consisting of a solitary paragraph, was admitted and marked. With the greatest respect, it seems to me that, once the defence witnesses have finished giving evidence, there is no longer any basis for denying the defence sight of the accused`s s 121 statement. There is no question of the defence tailoring evidence at this stage. All the material that would be required for the court to determine its relevancy, as mentioned in 
 Kulwant v PP 
 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 10
 , would also be before the court. If the defence wants to see the statement, I can see no reason why this should not be allowed. By s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed), an accused`s s 121 statement may be used to corroborate his testimony. Hence, the defence is denied a relevant piece of evidence by the prosecution if it refuses at this stage to let the defence have the accused`s s 121 statement. Where the case involves a bare allegation by a prosecution witness against the bare denial of the accused, such evidence may turn out to be of pivotal importance. This cannot be conducive to a fair trial.
Counsel`s submission, that the CPIB officers had been making various allegations against him during the recording of the s 121 statement, was not disputed by the prosecution. In any event, I was unable to accept the prosecution`s submission that the appellant must necessarily have known of the crux of the prosecution`s case by November 1993. I was not prepared to draw the inference that the prosecution invited me to draw, as I could only refer to a single paragraph of the s 121 statement. It would have been a dangerous course to follow as the solitary paragraph could easily have been taken out of context. It was impossible to assess the weight to be attributed to this lone paragraph. I was also uneasy with the fact that the allegation that the appellant gave the money to Koh was never mentioned in the charge.
The district judge placed some weight on the fact that the appellant did not even deny the charge when he was invited to give his s 122(6) statement. In my view, the short answer would be that he had already made the denial in his s 121 statement, as even the single paragraph admitted showed. It would therefore be unfair to draw any adverse inference against the appellant merely because he did not make the same denial again in the s 122(6) statement.
The purpose of s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) is to encourage accused persons to disclose their defence early. That being the case, it would be unwholesome to allow it to be used as a procedural trap for the unwary layman who is accused of a crime. It is unreasonable to expect him to know the legal subtleties between a long statement made to the authorities and a short statement. Hence, where an accused stands by his s 121 statement which was made before his s 122(6) statement, it is often, if not invariably, unfair to draw an adverse inference against him under s 123 of the CPC for not disclosing his defence again in his s 122(6) statement. Unless the s 121 statement is before the court, the court would not be in a position in such a case to see what has or has not been said to the investigating authorities. It may be different where the defence does not wish to rely on the s 121 statement, but that is a separate matter.
As for the appellant`s failure to even mention Koh in his s 122(6) statement or the fact that he was not in his office at the relevant time, there is yet another reason for not drawing any adverse inference against the appellant. This is that an accused is only expected to say things in answer to 
 the charge 
. Those are the terms of the s 122(6) notice. He is not expected to say anything in answer to some supposed or speculative charge which the prosecution could bring but has not. If the charge is badly drawn up, then the prosecution must reap what it has sown. The court may hold that an error in the charge is not material under s 162 of the CPC. The court may even alter the charge under s 163. However, it would be going much too far to expect an accused in his s 122(6) statement to answer a defective charge on the basis that there had been no error in the charge. An accused person should be entitled to take the charge as it was read to him.
In the present case, the prosecution`s case was not that the appellant on or about 13 July 1993 at 
 102 Depot Road 
 corruptly gave $100 
 through Goh Joo Siang 
 to Chua Kim Soon. The prosecution`s case was that the appellant 
 at about 8am 
 on 13 July 1993 corruptly gave $100 to Chua Kim Soon 
 through Alex Koh at the appellant`s office at Henderson Road who gave it to Chua Kim Soon at 102 Depot Road through Goh Joo Siang 
. None of the highlighted parts were mentioned in the charge. That being the case, the prosecution can hardly say that the appellant ought to have realized beforehand that Koh would be giving evidence against the appellant specifically on something that allegedly happened at 8am at the appellant`s office. There was thus no reason to expect the appellant to say anything about Alex Koh in his s 122(6) statement. Technically, the alleged offence might have occurred at the time and place and in the manner stated in the charge, but if material particulars are left out, then the prosecution can hardly complain when the s 122(6) statement does not address the issues that would have been raised by the omitted particulars.
It would not make a difference even if the investigating officers have told the appellant during his interview that Alex Koh had made the allegation against him. Neither should it matter even if that was the only allegation made against him in the interview or at some other occasion. This is because the appellant only has to answer 
 the charge 
, not some supposed or expected charge. It is not for the accused when giving the s 122(6) statement to anticipate what evidence the prosecution may choose to rely on in its hope that the court would not throw out the charge as being hopelessly bad or that the court would not hold the prosecution strictly to the charge that was framed and find it not proven.
As for the treatment of Low`s evidence, the learned trial judge held that Low was not an independent witness because he was an employee of the appellant`s. No other reason was given. This appears tantamount to saying that no employee can ever be an independent witness for his employer. With the greatest respect, this is clearly too wide a proposition of law. The alleged incident was supposed to have happened in the appellant`s office. That being the case, who else could have given evidence of this other than the appellant`s employees?
Low testified that the appellant did not go to his office on 13 July. He had very good reasons to remember that day, as it was the first time the appellant had taken him on a show-around. He also had good reasons to be looking out for the appellant that morning, as he wanted to know what the arrangements were. He could not have missed the appellant because there was a bell. His evidence was clear and unequivocal. There was therefore no reason to reject it out of hand unless the learned district judge was of the view that Low was prepared to commit perjury merely because he was an employee of the appellant`s.
From the above, it can be seen that there were enough reasons to allow the appeal even without looking at the additional evidence. However, as this evidence was in fact adduced, I should deal with it briefly. First, I was not convinced by the reason advanced by the appellant for not adducing the evidence earlier. In my view, the appellant could have been somewhat dilatory. However, it appeared to me that the manner in which the charge had been framed had played some part in the matter.
Apart from this, I need say nothing more save that I was not convinced by the prosecution`s submission that the additional evidence had been concocted by the defence. No doubt there were some discrepancies, especially the part where the appellant said that he was not informed of the meeting at 5pm on 14 July 1993. However, it appeared to me that these were truly minor and could certainly be explained by the same observation that it could be due to a difference of perception and recollection as to what happened. The additional evidence did not play a pivotal part in helping me reach my decision. It merely confirmed my view that the appellant`s conviction was unsafe.
For these reasons, I allowed the appellant`s appeal and quashed the conviction and sentence.

This is an appeal by the appellant against his conviction on the following charge: 
 
You Lee Choon Chee, (m/48 years), NRIC No 1041507-A, are charged that you, on or about 1 April 1994, at or about 10pm, at the ground floor of People`s Park Hawker Centre, Singapore, did cheat one Ang Kah Cheng, by deceiving him into giving you cash of $300 to exchange for a cheque which he would not have done so had he not been deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
At the end of the hearing, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons for doing so.
 The evidence
The prosecution case was as follows. On 1 April 1994 at about 2pm, the appellant hailed a taxi driven by one Ang Kah Cheng (Ang), got into the front seat and asked to be taken to a certain place in Kranji. Ang was reluctant to drive the appellant to his destination because it was accessible only by small roads. He wanted the appellant to alight at the main road instead. In the course of the argument which followed, the appellant took out his wallet and threw it on the seat so that Ang could see it. He identified himself as an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department (the CID) and said that the wallet contained his warrant card. On hearing this, Ang relented and agreed to take the appellant wherever he wanted to go. Ang did not check the wallet or the warrant card.
After stopping at Kranji, the appellant asked to be taken to another place in Ang Mo Kio. During this journey, the appellant asked Ang if he was interested in doing some small business. The appellant proposed to let out a canteen at the premises of the CID to Ang. Ang was interested in the proposal. The appellant wrote his name, `Mr Lee`, and a pager number `2187091` on a piece of paper and asked Ang to page him later in the day.
In the evening, Ang paged for the appellant who responded. They arranged to meet at 8pm at the People`s Park Complex (the complex). At about 8pm, they met and proceeded to a fast food outlet for drinks. Ang was told that the appellant`s boss would join them presently to hand the relevant forms to Ang. After a very long time, the boss did not turn up. The appellant went to make a telephone call, purportedly to his boss. When he returned, he told Ang to accompany him to a lift landing on the ground floor of the complex. There, he told Ang that his brother-in-law lived in the complex and asked Ang to wait at the lift landing while he paid his brother-in-law a quick visit. They would look for his boss later.
When the appellant returned, he told Ang that his brother-in-law needed $1,000 in cash. Ang believed the appellant`s story. He had only six $50 dollar notes with him and he gave the entire $300 to the appellant. The appellant said that he would ask his brother-in-law to issue a cheque to Ang in exchange for the cash. With that, he left with the money. After waiting in vain for about an hour for the appellant to return, Ang went home.
The next day, 2 April 1994, Ang paged for the appellant several times. Once the appellant responded but, on hearing Ang`s voice, he quickly put down the telephone. On 3 April 1994, Ang tried again to page for the appellant but without success. On 4 April 1994, Ang reported the matter to the police. He gave them the appellant`s pager number. Ang waited two days before reporting the incident to the police because he wanted to see if the appellant would return the money; the appellant seemed like a good man. By then, Ang did not have the piece of paper on which the appellant wrote his name and the pager number.
From the pager number provided by Ang, the police obtained the appellant`s particulars. The pager number was used by the appellant from November 1992 to July 1994. On 10 October 1994, the appellant was spotted by two police officers on patrol behaving suspiciously outside the building known as Colombo Court. They checked his identity card, found out he was wanted for cheating and arrested him. At an identification parade, Ang identified the appellant, without any difficulty, as the person who cheated him of $300.
On 11 October 1994, a statement was recorded from the appellant pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). The short statement reads: 
 
I do not admit to the offence. I do not take any money from the male Chinese and I do not know who is this male Chinese. That`s all.
 
 
 
Turning to the defence, the appellant denied any involvement in the cheating offence. The appellant also provided an alibi. In this connection, no notice of alibi was given as required by s 182 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). According to the appellant, from about 6.55pm to 11.45pm on 1 April 1994, he was at the home of a close friend, one Lee, who stayed at Blk 257, Yishun Ring Road, #04-1023. He did not know Lee`s full name. Lee was then terminally ill with cancer. With him were Lee`s wife, Chua Swee Choo, and Lee`s friend, Cheong Chin Hock. In May 1994, Lee passed away. The appellant explained that, as he did not commit the offence, he did not tell the police in detail where he was on the day of the offence.
Of the friendship between Lee and the appellant, the appellant said they had known each other since 1981. The appellant used to work for Lee at a coffee-shop along Balestier Road. At the end of 1981, the appellant left Lee`s employment. However, he continued to visit Lee at the coffee-shop. Lee stopped operating the coffee-shop in 1983. The appellant did not see Lee again until the Chinese New Year of 1985 or 1986 when Lee visited the appellant at his home in Teck Whye. After that visit, they lost contact for a number of years. In March 1993, Lee looked him up again. By then, the appellant was living in Ang Mo Kio. Lee told him that he was going to sell porridge at a stall in Ang Mo Kio. After that, the appellant visited Lee either fortnightly or monthly at the porridge stall. In February 1994, Lee told him that he had cancer. On 1 April 1994, he stayed at Lee`s home for five hours to keep Lee company. They chatted and the appellant drank beer.
After the appellant had given evidence, counsel for the defence applied for leave of court to adduce evidence from both Chua Swee Choo and Cheong Chin Hock to support the alibi defence. In the exercise of his discretion, the trial judge dismissed the application. As such, the defence case was brought to a close.
 The decision below
Having considered the totality of the evidence and the closing submissions of both sides, the trial judge rejected the appellant`s defence. He was satisfied that the charge was proved beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the appellant was convicted. On a review of the appellant`s antecedents, the trial judge called for a sentencing report to be prepared. Subsequently, the appellant was sentenced to eight years` preventive detention.
 The appeal
Before me, counsel for the appellant withdrew the appeal against sentence. She proceeded with the appeal against conviction on three grounds. First, it was contended that the trial judge erred in refusing the appellant leave to call the two alibi witnesses. Secondly, it was contended that the trial judge erred in rejecting the appellant`s defence. The final contention was that the trial judge failed to consider the implausibility of Ang`s evidence. I shall deal with each ground of appeal in turn.
To begin, s 182 of the Criminal Procedure Code states, as far as is material: 
 
(1) In any summary trial, the accused shall not without the leave of the court adduce evidence in support of an alibi unless, before the end of the prescribed period, he gives notice of particulars of the alibi.
(2) Without any prejudice to subsection (1), on any such trial the accused shall not without the leave of the court call any other person to give such evidence unless - 
(a) the notice under subsection (1) includes the name and address of the witness or, if the name or address is not known to the accused at the time he gives the notice, any information in his possession which might be of material assistance in finding the witness; 
...
 
 
 
(9) In this section -
 
 
 
`evidence in support of an alibi` means evidence tending to show that by reason of the presence of the accused at a particular place or in a particular area at a particular time he was not, or was unlikely to have been, at the place where the offence is alleged to have been committed at the time of its alleged commission;
 
 
 
At the outset, I reiterate the view I expressed in 
 Garmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v PP 
 
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 701
  that the primary purpose of the statutory requirement of an alibi notice is to enable the prosecution to verify the accused`s account so that the prosecution is able to challenge the accused`s version of the events if it is appropriate to do so. As Salmon LJ opined, in 
 R v Sullivan 
 [1970] 2 All ER 681, at p 684, the alibi notice aims to give the prosecution `an adequate opportunity of making inquiries as to the character and antecedents of the proposed alibi witnesses and also of investigating the story which they proposed to tell`. However, it is also recognized by the legislature that there may well be circumstances when it would not be possible to give the information at all or to do so within the prescribed period. Therefore, there remains a judicial discretion to allow alibi evidence to be adduced even when the statutory provision has not been complied with. Undoubtedly, this discretion must be exercised judiciously, based on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
Very eloquently, counsel for the appellant submitted several reasons why the trial judge should have exercised discretion in favour of the appellant. First and foremost, she contended that the appellant had a good and valid explanation for the failure to comply with the statutory provision. Originally, the appellant was unable to produce any alibi witnesses because both Chua Swee Choo and Cheong Chin Hock had refused to come forward to testify. The appellant was very reluctant to press them when he had not committed any offence. As the hearing date approached, however, the futility of a bare denial dawned on him. He impressed upon the witnesses the importance of their evidence. Both of them then agreed to testify.
Secondly, the appellant should not be faulted for his failure to mention his alibi defence in his s 122(6) statement which contained only a bare denial. The statement was recorded six months after the alleged cheating incident. It was perfectly understandable that the appellant could not recollect where he was on the day in question. In any case, the failure to mention the alibi defence in his statement had nothing to do with the failure to comply with the statutory provision and should not have been taken into account by the trial judge.
In addition, there could well have been a small error of judgment on the part of his former defence counsel. Defence counsel knew about the two witnesses a few days before the trial. At that point in time, she should have given notice of the alibi, albeit out of time. In the alternative, she could have made an oral application before the trial judge right at the start of trial. Instead, she waited until the end of the appellant`s evidence to do so. As such, the application was looked upon less favourably by the trial judge. The appellant should not have been penalized for the error of judgment on the part of defence counsel. For this proposition, counsel for the appellant cited 
 R v Cooper 
(1979) 69 Cr App R 229.
Fourthly, there is no distinction between alibi evidence given by the appellant himself and alibi evidence from other witnesses. In either case, an alibi notice must be given. In support, counsel for the appellant relied on 
 Vasan Singh v PP 
 
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 412
  and 
 R v Jackson and Robertson 
 [1973] Crim LR 356. In allowing the appellant to give alibi evidence on his own behalf, the trial judge should also have allowed the evidence of his two alibi witnesses in order to obtain a complete picture of the defence.
To conclude, counsel for the appellant argued that the appellant was not trying to prolong the trial. On the contrary, the matter proceeded most expeditiously. Barely more than two months after the arrest of the appellant, the trial was held. As such, the trial judge should have granted leave to call the two alibi witnesses who were present at the trial. If necessary, it was within the power of the trial judge to grant a short adjournment in order to allow the prosecution to investigate the matter. Instead, the trial judge decided the matter without the benefit of hearing two crucial witnesses. In so acting, the trial judge erred.
Much as I was impressed by the competence of counsel for the appellant, I found no merit in this ground of appeal. First of all, I accepted that the appellant`s own evidence of his whereabouts on 1 April 1994 was alibi evidence within s 182(9) of which particulars must be given in an alibi notice pursuant to s 182(1). Despite the lack of an alibi notice, the trial judge allowed the appellant to give alibi evidence. Nevertheless, the trial judge had an independent discretion by virtue of s 182(2) whether to allow alibi evidence to be adduced from other alibi witnesses. It is noted that s 182(2) begins with the material words `without prejudice to subsection (1)`. Moreover, in respect of other alibi witnesses, an accused person is expected to provide, as far as possible, particulars of these witnesses in the alibi notice. Therefore, different considerations arise in the situations envisaged in the two subsections. There is no room for the argument that, having allowed the appellant to give alibi evidence, it followed as a matter of course that the trial judge should have also allowed the other witnesses to do so.
Next, it was clear that the trial judge took into account the appellant`s explanation for failing to give particulars of his alibi and his alibi witnesses. As summarized by the trial judge, in the beginning, the appellant told defence counsel that he did not have any alibi witnesses. A few days before the trial, the appellant said he had two alibi witnesses. He further explained to defence counsel he had said that he had no alibi witnesses as they had refused to come forward. Counsel for the appellant confirmed that she received similar instructions from the appellant. The trial judge found the explanation to be unsatisfactory. I agreed with his opinion. Since October 1994, the appellant had been represented by defence counsel. The trial began on 20 December 1994. For about two months, the appellant had the benefit of legal advice from defence counsel. Yet, he did not inform defence counsel of the two potential alibi witnesses. To my mind, there was a clear distinction between having no alibi witnesses at all and having difficulty getting the witnesses to come forth to testify. There was no good reason to keep defence counsel in the dark as to the possible witnesses.
Turning to the s 122(6) statement of the appellant, he was asked expressly by the trial judge why he did not mention the alibi defence in his short statement. The relevant extracts from the notes of evidence are reproduced as follows: 
 
Q: Why did you not say in D1 [the short statement] that you were at Lee`s house at the time of the offence?
A: I did not want to trouble people when I did not commit the offence. 
Q: Explain that? 
A: (Witness is incoherent). 
Q: Look at the notice of warning in D1. Why did you not say that you did not commit the offence as you were at Lee`s house? 
A: I did not want to trouble the witnesses as most of them did not wish to come to court as they felt it is troublesome.
 
 
 
Following from the questions asked by the trial judge, defence counsel further clarified the position as follows: 
 
Q: Do you understand the notice of warning in D1?
A: I understand. 
Q: You understood but you still chose not to inform the court that you has [sic] alibi witness? 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Contrary to the submission by counsel for the appellant, it was not the appellant`s stance that he could not remember where he was on the day of the offence when the statement was recorded. Instead, he claimed it was a conscious choice on his part not to mention his potential witnesses although he understood the warning. In this connection, it was also his evidence at the trial that he did not tell the police of his whereabouts at the time of the offence because he did not commit the offence. The explanation proffered for the failure to mention the alibi witnesses within the s 122(6) statement was not credible at all. In my view, the trial judge was quite right to take into account these matters in exercising his discretion against the appellant. Even if, as counsel for the appellant suggested, the appellant could not recollect the events of 1 April 1994 when the statement was recorded, the puzzling fact remained that the appellant chose not to inform defence counsel until a few days before the trial of the existence of the alibi witnesses. Such astonishing behaviour had not been accounted for satisfactorily.
The trial judge was informed that defence counsel knew about the two witnesses a few days before the trial. He was not under any misapprehension that defence counsel only knew about the matter in the midst of the trial. In my opinion, the appellant was not disadvantaged by any apparent delay on the part of defence counsel in making the application. Rather, it was the appellant`s failure to inform defence counsel of the existence of such witnesses until the eleventh hour which influenced the trial judge to disallow the application for leave to adduce alibi evidence. 
 R v Cooper 
 must be distinguished on its facts. There, it was clearly the solicitor who failed to serve an alibi notice on several occasions. In the circumstances, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the trial judge should have allowed leave to adduce the evidence, subject to an appropriate adjournment for the prosecution to investigate the matter.
To sum up, the availability of the two witnesses was well within the knowledge of the appellant. This was not a case where the appellant did not know that there were witnesses at a particular place or that they were hard to trace. As and when he remembered where he was on 1 April 1994, the appellant should have provided defence counsel with all the relevant details. Instead, the appellant refused to mention his alibi witnesses, either to defence counsel or to the police. Spectacularly, he changed his mind at the last minute. In these circumstances, there was no reason why leave should be granted. Moreover, in a case of this nature, the credibility of the witnesses, especially the alibi witnesses, is important. The prosecution should have been given an opportunity to investigate the matter. In the premises, I dismissed this ground of appeal.
As for the second ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant`s evidence was subjected to intense scrutiny by the trial judge. This was quite unwarranted. The contradictions in the appellant`s evidence were mostly in respect of the relationship with Lee. These were but trivial inconsistencies which could be explained away by the sheer lapse of time between the events and the trial. After all, the friendship between the two men began 14 years ago. Considering the passage of time, counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant should not be faulted for his imprecise answers.
In the evaluation of a witness`s evidence, I accept that adequate allowance must be given for lapses in human memory. Nevertheless, I must have regard to the fact that a trial judge has the unique opportunity to observe the witnesses at trial, especially in a case like the present where the credibility of the witnesses is crucial. Of the appellant, the trial judge also remarked that he was uncomfortable when he was cross-examined about his friendship with Lee. In addition, the trial judge observed the appellant to be uncertain and evasive. Moreover, the appellant`s defence hinged on his presence at Lee`s home and thus, on the relationship between Lee and himself. It was noted that the appellant did not know Lee`s full name. He also gave various conflicting accounts as to how Lee contacted him again in 1993. These were but some of the unsatisfactory aspects of his evidence which could not be attributed solely to lapses in memory. More crucially, there was the unresolved question why the appellant did not choose to reveal his alibi evidence much earlier. In the premises, there was no reason for me to reverse the finding of the trial judge that the appellant`s defence was not to be believed.
In respect of the final ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant submitted that Ang`s evidence was implausible. For instance, it was incredible that Ang believed the appellant to be a CID officer when he did not even see the warrant card. Moreover, it was unbelievable that the Ang would trust a virtual stranger to the extent of giving the appellant $300 in cash. Finally, the appellant would not have given his pager number and name if he set out to cheat Ang. Therefore, Ang`s evidence must be rejected.
The very same arguments were canvassed before the trial judge by defence counsel. The trial judge observed that Ang was a naive person. He was intimidated by the appellant`s claim to be a CID officer. Later, Ang thought he was given what seemed to be a good business opportunity. Ang tried to please the appellant. In these circumstances, he trusted the appellant enough to part with $300. Furthermore, the trial judge was of the view that the appellant made the `fatal mistake` of giving his pager number to Ang. I accepted these findings and observations made by the trial judge. In addition, I noted that the appellant was caught fortuitously six months after the police report was lodged. At the identification parade, Ang recognized the appellant quickly and effortlessly. Taking into account all these factors, I agreed with the trial judge that the appellant was guilty of the charge. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal.

 Background
This was an application for criminal revision at the instance of a district judge. The five respondents pleaded guilty before the district judge on 11 September 1995 to a joint charge under s 143 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) which averred that they were members of an unlawful assembly on 20 March 1992, whose common object was to commit an offence of illegal gaming contrary to s 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49). The district judge imposed the following fines on the respondents:
 
 
(1) Nyu Tiong Lam (B7) - $3,000 fine, in default nine weeks` imprisonment. 
 
(2) Poh Ah Liang (B16) - $5,000 fine, in default 15 weeks` imprisonment. 
 
(3) Tan Gee Luan (B18) - $4,000 fine, in default 12 weeks` imprisonment. 
 
(4) Goh Ah Moy (B22) - $3,000 fine, in default nine weeks` imprisonment. 
 
(5) Toh Chiaw (B26) - $3,000 fine, in default nine weeks` imprisonment.
  
 
 
On 15 September 1995, the district judge applied to the High Court to exercise its powers of revision pursuant to s 268 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). The respondents had been charged under s 143 Penal Code, which carries a maximum punishment of six months` imprisonment, or fine, or both. The charge had been classified by the prosecution as a `Magistrate Arrest Case` (MAC). The district judge stated that he had erred in imposing fines which exceeded the sentencing jurisdiction of a magistrate`s court, as contained in s 11(5) CPC. He prayed that the High Court would set aside the sentences imposed and substitute appropriate sentences.
The issue stated by the DPP in his skeletal arguments was whether a district judge who hears a case classified as an `MAC` is empowered to impose a sentence which exceeds the jurisdiction of a magistrate. Section 11(5) CPC specifies that the magistrate`s court may impose a fine not exceeding $2,000. The DPP submitted that the prosecution would support the district judge`s application for revision. He referred to s 7(3) CPC, which states: 
 
(3) Every district court shall have in the exercise of its jurisdiction all the powers which belong to and are exercised by a magistrate`s court.
 
 
 
Every person appointed as a district judge is ex officio a magistrate (see s 9(5), Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321)). There is, therefore, no need to specifically appoint and gazette him as a magistrate as well. In any event, in many cases, a district judge may have already been previously gazetted as a magistrate. To my knowledge, this was precisely the case of the district judge who dealt with the case below. His district court had in the exercise of its jurisdiction all the powers which belong to and are exercised by a magistrate`s court.
I was of the opinion that the real question was whether the district judge was sitting in a district court or in a magistrate`s court. It appears that there are no directly relevant authorities. Two cases were cited by the DPP in support of his submissions. I did not find them particularly helpful. 
 PP v Tengku Hitam 
 
 
 
[1962] MLJ 414
  states the following unexceptional proposition: the prosecution should decide whether a case should be tried in a magistrate`s court or a sessions court, bearing in mind the limits of each court`s sentencing jurisdiction. Either way, the court is constrained by the maximum punishment prescribed by law in respect of the offence in question. 
 PP v Thui Kuan Wing 
 
 
 
[1963] MLJ 368
  does provide some oblique support for the view that a district judge who sits as a magistrate should limit the exercise of his powers to those of a magistrate. In that sense, he cannot sit in his `dual capacity`.
The DPP suggested that the district judge was sitting in a district court, but was compelled to exercise the powers of a magistrate, on account of the fact that the case had been classified as an `MAC`. In my view, the matter fell to be determined largely on the application of first principles. In this connection, it was necessary to consider some aspects of the administrative practices adopted by the prosecution and the subordinate courts.
 The discretion to classify offences
To my understanding, as confirmed by the DPP, the discretion to classify offences for the purpose of prosecution is exercised by the DPP`s office, and by the police. In the first instance, when an offender is arrested on grounds of having committed an offence, the police, who bear the responsibility for preparing the charge, will classify the offence according to whether it falls within the jurisdiction of the magistrate`s court or the district court. This will be done with reference to the relevant jurisdiction provisions in the CPC, ie ss 7 to 10 and Sch A. I would assume that, if necessary, the question of the appropriate classification of the offence will be referred to the DPP for directions.
 Classification and the extent of the magistrate`s `ordinary` or `special` jurisdiction
The `ordinary` hearing jurisdiction of a magistrate`s court is set out in s 8 CPC. In addition, there may be what I shall term the `special` jurisdiction conferred by s 9 CPC. Thus, an offence which attracts a maximum punishment exceeding the ordinary hearing (and, a fortiori, sentencing) jurisdiction of a magistrate may still be triable by a magistrate`s court, by virtue of col 8 of Sch A to the CPC. I have identified 23 such `either way` Penal Code offences which are specifically triable by a magistrate`s court (and, of course, a district court) in col 8. In addition, s 10 CPC enables the Public Prosecutor to authorize a magistrate`s court to try offences not otherwise within its jurisdiction (under s 9). The decision as to the appropriate `classification` is obviously a matter of policy, by which the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is guided.
 Classification and the nature of the jurisdiction invoked
 
 
 
 i No `underclassification`
 
In the present case, the offence in question was one of unlawful assembly, falling under s 143 of the Penal Code (Cap 68). Thus, there was actually no question of `underclassifying` an `either way` offence. It was in fact a matter which was properly classifiable as an `MAC` offence.
The case was fixed for hearing before the district judge, in subordinate court number 8, which, according to the DPP, is normally used as a district court. Whatever the implications of such an arrangement, the district judge acknowledged that he fell into error in sentencing the accused beyond the sentencing jurisdiction of a magistrate. This tacitly recognizes that the jurisdiction sought to be invoked by the prosecution by classifying the case as an `MAC` was that of a magistrate`s court. It did not matter that the judicial officer who dealt with the case was a district judge. Accordingly, the usual $2,000 limit on his powers to impose a fine would apply, unless the proviso in s 11(5) CPC for `enhanced` sentencing for repeat offenders is invoked.
 ii Classification as `DAC`
It was conceivably also open to the prosecution to classify the s 143 Penal Code charge as a District Arrest Case (DAC). The consequence is that where a district court deals with the case, it may then exercise its powers to impose a fine to the full extent of a district court`s sentencing jurisdiction, ie $10,000, since there is no prescribed limit to the amount of fine that may be imposed under s 143 Penal Code. The district court will, of course, remain bound by the prescribed limit as to the term of imprisonment which may be imposed under s 143, ie six months.
Conversely, it is conceivable that an offence which falls within the range of `either way` offences could be classified as a `DAC`. There is, of course, no difficulty if a district judge hears the case. By inadvertence, it may end up before a magistrate. By the same reasoning employed earlier, the jurisdiction sought to be invoked by the chosen classification is that of the district court. However, since the magistrate`s court also has jurisdiction, it remains open, theoretically, to the magistrate to deal with the case, notwithstanding that it has been classified as a `DAC`. In such a case, however, I would advise that the better course would be for the magistrate to decline to deal with the case. The prosecution should also be duty-bound to point out their classification of the case as a `DAC`.
 iii `Underclassification` as an `MAC`
Even assuming that this was a case of deliberate `underclassification` of an `either way` offence as an `MAC`, the same principle should apply. If the prosecution has chosen to exercise its discretion to `underclassify` the offence, it has also specified the jurisdiction of the court which is invoked. In other words, the `MAC` charge should, in the normal course, have been heard in a magistrate`s court. It may be purely fortuitous that an `MAC` offence is fixed before a district judge. It cannot be that the accused should then face the prospect of a sentence which exceeds a magistrate`s court`s ordinary sentencing jurisdiction. This would be arbitrary and unjust. It would be grossly unfair to the accused, who may well have elected to plead guilty on the perfectly justifiable understanding that the `MAC` classification would mean that the normal magistrate`s court`s ceiling on the punishment would apply.
In conclusion, I was of the opinion that the district judge had correctly made the application for revision by the High Court. I accepted the DPP`s arguments, albeit with one modification: in hearing an `MAC`, the district judge was sitting in a magistrate`s court, not a district court, and was thereby exercising the powers of a magistrate`s court. Accordingly, he could only pass sentences within the ceiling imposed by s 11(5) CPC.
 The application for deterrent sentences
The DPP pointed out the fact that all five respondents, whose ages range between 38 (B7) to 58 (B16), had each been previously convicted on at least two occasions for offences of gaming under the Common Gaming Houses Act. Their previous convictions were as follows: 
 
 
(1) Nyu Tiong Lam (B7): 
 
(06) .06.75 s 411 Cap 103; - Fine $ 1,500Dishonestly receiving stolen property 
 
(07) .01.81 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 100Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(17) .10.84 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 200Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(10) .07.91 s 447 Cap 224; Criminal trespass - Fine $ 400 
 
(16) .07.91 s 447 Cap 224; Criminal trespass - Fine $ 500 
 
(2) Poh Ah Liang (B16): 
 
(17) .2.71 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 35Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(7) .4.83 s 7(2) Cap 96; - Fine $ 40Gaming in public 
 
(17) .1.94 s 7 Cap 49; - Fine $ 3,000Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(3) Tan Gee Luan (B18): 
 
(15) .01.81 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 200Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(27) .05.81 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 80Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(07) .06.82 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 180Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(20) .07.82 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 300Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(01) .08.83 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 350Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(21) .03.91 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 800Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(4) Goh Ah Moy (B22): 
 
(28) .03.80 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 100Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(09) .04.84 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 180Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(10) .07.93 s 6(1) Cap 49; - Fine $ 600Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(5) Toh Chiaw (B26): 
 
(14) .12.84 s 6(1) Cap 96; - Fine $ 100Gaming in a common gaming house 
 
(19) .01.94 s 7 Cap 49; - Fine $ 2,000Gaming in a common gaming house
  
 
 
In view of their respective records of previous convictions, the DPP urged this court to impose deterrent custodial sentences on all five offenders, since the previous fines had evidently not created any impact on them. Having regard to the High Court`s powers of revision (s 268 CPC), I had little doubt that the course suggested by the DPP was appropriate. While the respondents were technically first offenders as far as the unlawful assembly charge was concerned, they admitted that the common object of the assembly was to commit an offence of gaming in a common gaming house. As I was minded to make orders which would operate adversely to them, I called upon them to speak in their own defence, as stipulated by s 268(2) CPC.
In their defence, the respondents claimed to have been ignorant of the law. B7 contended that they had not committed a serious offence but merely an offence of unlawful assembly. They had only been convicted of minor gambling offences in the past. Together with B16, B18 and B22, he claimed to have been informed at the subordinate courts that if he pleaded guilty to the present charge, he would only be fined a sum between $800 and $2,000. B16 explained that they had originally been charged together with many others for unlawful assembly. The majority of the others pleaded guilty before the district judge in court 5 and were fined. As the respondents did not plead guilty then, their case was transferred to court 8. B16 initially claimed that the district judge in court 5 told them that they would be fined between $800 and $2,000 if they pleaded guilty. I expressed my absolute disbelief that something so preposterous could have occurred. B16 then claimed that an interpreter in court 5 had told them about the likely range of fines. B18 supplemented what B16 had said, adding that there were more than 20 accused persons originally charged with unlawful assembly in court 5. She did not plead guilty in court 5 as she did not have enough money to pay the fines. Like B16, she claimed that she pleaded guilty later in court 8 because she was informed that the fine would be somewhere between $800 and $2,000.
In my judgment, the various allegations of the respondents, even if substantiated, were all irrelevant. It was absurd to suggest that the judge or any other court officer could have told them what the range of fines would be if they pleaded guilty. I hasten to add, however, that if what was alleged had actually taken place, it would not be tolerated. For the purposes of the present proceedings, it made no difference what anyone might have told them about the likely range of fines. As far as the exercise of my revisionary powers was concerned, they were unable to persuade me that deterrent custodial sentences were not in order. It was clear that all their previous convictions and numerous fines had not enlightened them. Nowhere was this more apparent than from B7`s assertion that unlawful assembly for the purposes of gaming in a common gaming house was not a `serious offence`. None of the respondents appeared remorseful in the least, nor had they been able to appreciate the error of their ways. In the circumstances, I imposed the following sentences of imprisonment in addition to the fine: nine weeks` imprisonment on B7, 15 weeks` imprisonment on B16, 12 weeks` imprisonment on B18, nine weeks` imprisonment on B22 and B26 respectively. These terms were precisely what the district judge himself had ordered as default sentences.
After the respondents were notified of their prison sentences, B7 lodged vehement protests. He queried whether this court had made a mistake, since they had not appealed against the district judge`s sentence and had in fact already paid their fines. He reiterated that the other accused persons who had pleaded guilty earlier in court 5 were only fined and not jailed. I explained to him more than once that the imprisonment terms were imposed on the basis that the district judge had requested this court to correct the error in the sentences. Bearing in mind all their previous convictions, a deterrent sentence was called for. B7, B16 and B18 were apparently not content with my explanation. They continued to voice their objections, maintaining that they had already paid the fines. I informed them that if they persisted in creating a spectacle of themselves in court, I would not hesitate to double their sentences. Unfortunately for B7, this warning fell on deaf ears. As I had not yet recorded their sentences, I ordered that B7 be sentenced instead to imprisonment for 18 weeks.
I was informed by the DPP that the respondents had already paid the fines imposed by the district judge. As the fines should not have exceeded $2,000, I ordered that the respective payments which were in excess of $2,000 be refunded to the respondents.

Whether prosecution must specify which part of drugs found in accused's flat were for trafficking and which were for possession
 
The appellant was convicted on one count of trafficking in 1,200g of opium containing not less than 20g of morphine by having it in her possession for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`) read with s 5(2), one count of unauthorised possession of 24,988g of opium contrary to s 8(a) of the Act, and one count of unauthorised possession of apparatus used in the consumption of a controlled drug contrary to s 9 of the Act. I dismissed her appeal against conviction. I now give my grounds.
The undisputed facts were that different quantities of opium were found at various places in the appellant`s flat. It was common ground that the only two other persons who had the keys to the flat, namely, the appellant`s son and daughter, did not know about the opium.
The locations of the opium found were as follows: 
(a) seven bundles weighing 821.7g, 925.1g, 1,486g containing not less than 89.97g of morphine, 1,576g containing not less than 69.75g of morphine, 1,403g, 1,569g and 1,339g respectively in a styrofoam box on top of the wardrobe in the appellant`s bedroom; 
(b) three bundles containing in total not less than 1,870g of opium in a plastic bag on the lower shelf in the wardrobe above; 
(c) a total of 558.73g in seven containers and 55.54g in two plastic bags found in a chest of drawers in the appellant`s bedroom; 
(d) 576.1g in a milk tin in a box on the floor of the appellant`s bedroom; 
(e) 61.86g in another two containers on the floor at another part of the appellant`s bedroom; 
(f) 727.2g in a bundle on the lower shelf of a display cabinet in the hall extension; 
(g) 5,080g, 4,242g, 1,497g, 2,255g and 145.3g in five containers together with another stained with opium in a kitchen cabinet.
The apportionment of 1,200g and 24,988g was arrived at as a result of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Essentially, one capital charge of trafficking was split into two non-capital charges of trafficking in a much smaller amount and possession of the rest. It was necessarily artificial and there was no indication which of the drugs the respective charges referred to.
The apparatus used in the consumption of drugs were eight opium pipes. Five were found in two suitcases placed on top of the wardrobe and three in the chest of drawers in the appellant`s bedroom. I need not deal with this aspect of the case as counsel for the appellant did not argue against the conviction for possession of these articles.
The appellant`s defence in respect of the first two charges was that the drugs (apart from the small amount in the drawers which the appellant admitted was hers) belonged to one Tan Hock Lye (`Tan`). Her evidence was that, when Tan was taken to the flat after the search, Tan had admitted that the opium belonged to him.
The crux of the defence was that she had allowed Tan to keep opium at her flat. In return, he gave her some opium. She had merely allowed Tan into the flat whenever he came and, essentially, left him to do whatever he pleased. When he left, he just closed the door and it locked by itself. She admitted that she gave him permission to keep opium in her flat.
Counsel for the appellant made two arguments in support of the appeal. The first was that the prosecution had not made out a prima facie case of possession of the opium against the appellant at the end of the prosecution case. Counsel relied on 
 Sukor v PP 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 221
. His argument was that in order to prove possession, it must be proven that the appellant had physical control over the drugs and the requisite intention to deal with the drugs as if they were his.
I did not find this case useful here. In that case, the court was dealing with a situation where the drugs in question were in a common pool to which more than one person might have access. Furthermore, it was the prosecution`s contention there that they had proven that the accused in that case had the intention to deal with the drugs as if they were his, and that that was enough to constitute 
 animus possidendi 
.
The present case is straightforward. Out of three persons who had the keys to the flat, it was common ground that two of them had nothing to do with the opium. In the absence of any explanation, the irresistible inference would be that the opium was in the possession of the third person, namely, the appellant. The agreed facts would have constituted a prima facie case.
As for the defence, even if this was true, it did not in any way detract from the fact that the opium was in the appellant`s actual physical possession. She was the one who allowed Tan to store opium in her flat. She knew it was opium. Whether Tan`s opium should be kept in her flat depended solely on her. There could be no other conclusion but that she had actual physical control of the opium. I had no doubt that she was in possession of all the opium found in the flat.
The second argument was that the prosecution did not state which part of the opium was meant for trafficking and which part was not. This argument was misconceived. What the prosecution had done was merely to apportion the opium so that the capital charge of trafficking in all the opium became two non-capital charges. The prosecution had proven possession of all the opium found in the appellant`s flat. The onus fell on the appellant to rebut the presumption of trafficking.
In my view, the splitting up of the charge by the prosecution in this case amounted to no more than this: even if the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption in relation to any part of the opium, the appellant could only be convicted of trafficking in 1,200g of opium and possession of the rest. That was the only effect of this exercise of prosecutorial discretion. In order to succeed against the charge of trafficking, the appellant still had to prove on a balance of probabilities that none of the opium seized was intended for trafficking. Put in another way, the rebuttal of the presumption of trafficking in relation to the 1,200g must be in the context that she was in possession of another 24,988g.
It is a fallacy to say that because the opium had been apportioned, it is incumbent on the prosecution always to allege which specific physical part of the apportioned drugs is meant for trafficking, and which part is not. Whether a failure to do so results in embarrassment must depend on the facts of each case, in particular, the defence, if any, of the accused. In many cases, it would be an exercise in futility.
Before me, counsel for the appellant rightly did not support the defence mounted below that the opium was Tan`s and that the appellant had merely allowed Tan to store it at her flat. Such a defence is no defence at all. It is settled law that possession of drugs for the purpose of returning them to the owner is possession for the purpose of trafficking, for the bailee would eventually have to transfer possession back to the bailor. This was held by the Court of Appeal in 
 Lee Yuan Kwang & Ors v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 349
 at p 368: 
 
Adopting the court`s interpretation of `deliver` in 
 Goh Hock Huat
, he could not succeed in rebutting the presumption of possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking on the basis of the argument that `returning` the drugs to Lee was not trafficking. By a future act which would transfer possession of the drugs to Lee, Yakoob would be admitting, in effect, that he would deliver the drugs to Lee, albeit at a subsequent time. The fact that this time had not yet arrived was immaterial because of s 5(2), the insertion of which was intended to clarify Parliament`s intention that once the presumption of trafficking was invoked, `there was no need to show the overt act of trafficking which he had intended to do.`
 
 
 
It remains only to be stated that in 
 PP v Goh Hock Huat 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 274
, it was stated by the Court of Appeal that to `deliver` is `merely the transfer of possession from one party to another.`
There was therefore no real defence. The appellant had not managed to rebut the presumption of trafficking in respect of any of the opium (regardless of morphine content) in her possession, save that which was conceded by the prosecution by its exercise of prosecutorial discretion. The appellant had not been prejudiced or embarrassed in any way by the apportionment which resulted in a single capital charge being split into two non-capital ones.
The only point I would add is this: since not all the opium was tested for morphine content, it follows that the 1,200g the trafficking charge dealt with must come from the portion that was tested. In other words, the 1,200g could only be carved out of the 3,062g that was tested. This fact was not material in the present case. Since each case must depend on its own facts, I do not wish to say whether it may make any difference in other cases on different facts.
For these reasons, I was of the view that there was no merit in the appeal. I accordingly dismissed it.

The plaintiff company carries on business as a cruise operator. Between October 1994 and December 1995, it provided cruises from Singapore aboard its chartered vessel, Nautican. These cruises commenced from the Singapore Cruise Centre which was constructed and is run by the second defendants, the Port of Singapore Authority (`PSA`). At the material time, however, there were also two other organisations which were interested in cruises emanating from Singapore. They were the first defendants, Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (`STPB`), and the Gambling Suppression Branch (`GSB`) of the Criminal Investigation Department (`CID`) of the Police Force.
On 11 November 1995, the plaintiffs commenced this action and by the indorsement of claim on their writ, stated that, among other things, their claim was for: 
(i) a declaration that the plaintiffs were entitled to berthing rights in respect of Nautican at the usual berths allocated to cruise liners calling into Singapore; 
(ii) a declaration that PSA and STPB had wrongfully and without basis refused and denied berthing rights to the plaintiffs; 
(iii) an injunction to restrain PSA and STPB from wrongfully refusing and denying the plaintiffs berthing rights in respect of Nautican and an order for them to forthwith grant such rights to Nautican and allow Nautican to berth for such period as may be necessary.
On the same morning, the plaintiffs made an ex parte application for an injunction in terms of this last sub-paragraph.
I heard the application and made interim orders restraining STPB from issuing instructions to PSA to refuse and/or deny berthing rights to Nautican and restraining PSA from themselves refusing or denying berthing rights to that vessel until such date as the application could be heard on an inter-partes basis. The inter-partes hearing took place about three weeks later and, at its conclusion, I discharged the interim injunction with effect from 4 December 1995 and directed an early trial.
 The plaintiffs` claim
The plaintiffs` claim as elaborated by their subsequently filed statement of claim rests on three main planks to wit, first an administrative law claim based on ultra vires and/or illegal action on the part of both defendants causing them damage, secondly breach of contract by PSA, and thirdly, various torts committed by both defendants.
Their statement of claim recites that on 22 June 1995 a meeting was held between companies in Singapore engaged in the cruise business (including the plaintiffs) and representatives of PSA, STPB and the GSB. At that meeting, one Mr Lee Loong Koon, an officer of STPB, stated that the three bodies in consultation with each other had agreed on a set of conditions to regulate and monitor casino activities on board cruise vessels, especially on vessels undertaking Cruises to Nowhere (`CNW`). The pleading goes on to state that the guidelines were then communicated orally to the attendees. These guidelines included a rule that CNW cruises should not exceed 30% of the voyages undertaken by a cruise vessel on a three monthly basis and that berths might not be allocated for CNW cruises in excess of the 30% limit. A definition was given of a CNW as being a cruise which lasted less than 36 hours from the time of departure from the berth in Singapore until re-berthing here and this was irrespective of whether the vessel called at any destination before its return.
The plaintiffs challenge the guidelines on several counts. First, they aver that PSA was not empowered in law to make or issue the guidelines. Secondly, they aver that in purporting to issue the guidelines PSA had acted in breach of its statutory duty. Thirdly, they assert that the guidelines were formulated by a Cruise Review Committee (which comprised PSA, STPB and the GSB) which committee had no existence in law and therefore the purported delegation by PSA to the Cruise Review Committee to formulate the guidelines was invalid. Fourthly, PSA erred in law in issuing the guidelines and fifthly, the guidelines were uncertain. In the alternative, they contend that PSA had improperly exercised powers conferred by its constitutive statute by exercising them in a way that constituted an abuse of power. Their conclusion is that the guidelines in themselves were ultra vires and inconsistent with the provisions of the legislation.
As regards STPB, the plaintiffs contend that they were not empowered in law to make or issue the guidelines and/or that they erred in law in issuing the same. In the circumstances, STPB was acting outside its jurisdiction and ultra vires its constitutive statute in purporting to issue the guidelines.
The plaintiffs also contend that there were flaws in the actual decision to deny Nautican berthing facilities on the basis of an alleged breach of the CNW limit of 30%. First, PSA denied the plaintiffs natural justice and procedural fairness. Alternatively, this decision was made by PSA at the direction or behest of Mr Lee of STPB and PSA failed to properly exercise its discretion before making the decision. Thirdly, PSA decided to deny berthing facilities to Nautican without regard to the merits of the plaintiffs` case and also took into account irrelevant considerations when making that decision. They further assert that PSA`s decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable person in its place would have made it.
In the alternative, the plaintiffs aver that STPB and PSA purported to exercise powers which were conferred on them for the benefit of the public or a section of the public, either with intent to injure the plaintiffs or in the knowledge that the acts were ultra vires their respective constitutive statutes. This is the tort of misfeasance by a public servant.
The next ground, also a tortious one, is that STPB knowing, at all material times, that the plaintiffs had entered into contracts which required the plaintiffs to undertake CNWs on every Saturday and Sunday, wrongfully compelled or attempted to compel the plaintiffs to breach the said contracts. The plaintiffs were prevented from performing their contracts because they were not allowed to adhere to Nautican`s existing schedule for CNWs and as a result breached the said contracts and thereby suffered loss and damage. A similar allegation was made in respect of PSA.
The next ground, that founded in contract, is that there was a contract between the plaintiffs and PSA whereby PSA was obliged to provide berthing facilities to Nautican on a first-come-first-serve basis. PSA had breached this contract by denying Nautican its berth. In this connection, a further tortious ground is raised against STPB in that it is averred to have known of the contracts between the plaintiffs and PSA and to have wrongfully induced and procured PSA, in breach of the contract, to deny and/or suspend berthing facilities which otherwise would have been allocated to the plaintiffs.
The reliefs sought by the plaintiffs take the form of declarations and injunctions. The plaintiffs want the guidelines to be declared ultra vires and void. They also want the decision of PSA to deny Nautican a berth to be similarly declared ultra vires and void. They want a declaration that they are entitled not to be denied berthing facilities by PSA on account of their failure to comply with the guidelines. They want injunctions supporting the declarations so that they will be able to carry on their trade and provide as many cruises to nowhere as they deem fit. They also claim damages, interest and costs.
 The facts
 
 
 
 Background
 
STPB is a body corporate established under the Tourist Promotion Board Act (Cap 328) (`TPB Act`). Under the TPB Act, STPB has the power, inter alia, to engage in, assist or promote the improvement of facilities for visitors to Singapore and to make recommendations to the Government in relation to any measures which may be taken with a view to increasing the number of visitors to Singapore. STPB appears to have first recognised the potential for developing Singapore as an international and regional cruise centre in 1987. The next year, it established a Cruise Department to develop and implement a plan to promote international and regional passenger cruising in ASEAN with Singapore as the cruise hub.
There was a parallel development within PSA, a body corporate established under the Port of Singapore Authority Act (Cap 236) (`PSA Act`) and for this purpose they set up their Cruise Development Unit in 1988. PSA is the owner, operator and person in control of all wharves in Singapore. To further its objective of developing Singapore as a cruise hub, PSA constructed the International Passenger Terminal at the Singapore Cruise Centre (World Trade Centre) which has berths for cruise vessels to come alongside for disembarkation and embarkation of passengers. The Singapore Cruise Centre has been operational since 1992.
In February 1989, STPB and PSA established an ad hoc committee named `STPB/PSA Cruise Development Liaison Committee`. The objective of the committee was to develop and promote international passenger cruising in ASEAN with Singapore as the cruise hub.
The plaintiff company was incorporated in November 1990. Shortly afterwards, the plaintiffs applied to PSA to open an account with it in connection with their intended use of the port facilities and services provided by PSA. At the time of their application, the plaintiffs indicated that the services that they required related to passenger cruise vessels. The plaintiffs` application was approved by PSA on 10 November 1990.
As the cruise industry developed, however, so did news reports that there was undue gambling on cruise ships and some of them operated as `floating casinos`. For example, in October 1992, the Hong Kong magazine 
 Trade Winds 
, in an article which alleged that Singapore`s bureaucracy was affecting its ambition to become one of the world`s leading centres for cruise ships, also stated that the attempt to attract cruise operators to Singapore had met with limited success. A number of gambling ships which cruised out to international waters where they could legally run casinos had started operating from the port but no new dedicated cruise ships had started using it as a base. According to Mrs Kathleen Tan of PSA, this article alarmed PSA because it considered that Singapore was getting the wrong image.
In March 1993, there were further developments in this area. A number of advertisements were placed in the press in respect of the cruise ship, Regent Spirit. That month, PSA received a complaint from a member of the public who had responded to one such advertisement seeking to recruit `high powered sales agents`. The complainant alleged that he had been told to recruit gambling passengers to board the Regent Spirit. PSA wrote to the Ministry of Home Affairs drawing their attention to the advertisement. In response, PSA was contacted by the GSB and subsequently, these two organisations and STPB met Regal Cruises, the operators of Regent Spirit, to voice their disapproval of the advertisements which highlighted gambling on board the vessel. This meeting and other action taken by PSA were reported in the press which also announced that PSA would soon introduce new guidelines for cruise operations to re-emphasise its position on blatant selling of cruise ships as gambling ships.
It was also reported in the local press that PSA would not approve a cruise ship`s berthing application if its activities were considered `undesirable`. In court, Mrs Tan confirmed that a berth had actually been denied to the Regent Spirit. This action had been taken because PSA was very concerned with the image of the Cruise Centre. The factors which PSA took into account when it denied the Regent Spirit her berth were that first, there was an association of cruise ships with the Cruise Centre; secondly, the advertisements which had appeared which had given the impression that the ship was a floating casino; and thirdly, that PSA did not want Singapore to become a hub for floating casinos.
The contact between the three organisations in April 1993 led to them forming a committee (`the committee`) to deal with concerns that a growing number of CNW cruise packages were predominantly gambling cruises during which illegal activities such as gambling, prostitution and illegal money lending took place. PSA and STPB were concerned that such activities would tarnish the image of Singapore as an international cruise hub and would have a negative effect on the national economy in that there would be an outflow of foreign exchange leading to a negative multiplier for the economy. The main members of the committee were Mrs Kathleen Tan who was then the manager of PSA`s Cruise Development Department, Mr Lee Loong Koon, who held the position of Director of Events Management and Cruise Business Department at STPB, and the officer in charge of the GSB, Mr Tan Kheng Seng.
On 22 April 1993, PSA drew up a paper entitled `Guidelines on Cruise Ships based in Singapore` for the purposes of discussion at a senior management meeting to be held the following week. The intention of the paper as stated therein was to address measures to prevent floating casinos operating out of Singapore without over-regulating and stifling holiday/leisure cruises. Guidelines for ships operating out of Singapore had been discussed with STPB with the aim of encouraging ships which, besides providing wholesome cruise and leisure activities, would also give multiplier contributions to the Singapore economy.
The paper set out specific guidelines for cruise ships. Among these were: 
(i) cruise lines were not to promote or organise gambling cruises; 
(ii) the ratio of CNWs to destination cruises should be 30:70 in terms of cruise trips and CNWs should only be fillers to help the load factors in between destination cruises; 
(iii) for destination cruises the ship should make a minimum of two port calls in two different countries (in addition to Singapore) per voyage in her itinerary. This would promote destination cruises and development of the region as a cruise area.
The paper noted that to test the guidelines PSA and STPB had met various cruise operators and had ascertained that these operators were generally in agreement with the guidelines.
Events leading up to the public announcement of the guidelines
In 1994, there were further newspaper reports on gambling activities aboard cruise ships. In April 1994, a Singapore registered cruise ship was apparently raided and detained by the police in Sabah for allowing Malaysians to patronise a casino on board while cruising in Malaysian waters. In June 1994, there was a report in 
 The New Paper 
 about children being allowed to operate the jackpot machines on board a cruise ship and in August the Malaysian authorities banned a casino ship from operating in Sabah.
In September 1994, the committee held its first meeting for that year. The GSB informed the other parties that it had received information about gambling syndicates on cruise ships, settlement talks and loan sharks and requested that all three bodies act collectively. STPB had no objections to this suggestion on the basis that any enforcement action came from the police force.
In the meantime, the plaintiff company was undergoing a change of shareholders and management. Its then managing director, Mr Daniel Chui, visited Jakarta in June 1994 and negotiated with two Indonesians, a Mr Hassan and a Mr Sukardi, to take over the plaintiffs. He also introduced Nautican as a suitable vessel to be chartered for the plaintiffs` business. The two Indonesians became directors of the plaintiff company that same month and bought over its share capital in October 1994. They employed a Mr Purwadi, another Indonesian, to assist them in the cruise business. From October 1994, Mr Purwadi was permanently in Singapore as Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of the plaintiff company. Nautican was chartered by the plaintiffs as from 31 October 1994 for a period of two years.
On 6 October 1994, the plaintiffs met with PSA. Mr Chui and two colleagues represented the plaintiffs and PSA was represented by Mrs Tan and three others. Mr Chui informed PSA that Nautican would arrive in Singapore on its maiden voyage from Australia on 29 October 1994. Thereafter, Nautican would use Singapore as a hub and would be calling at Penang, Pulau Pangkor, Malacca, Semarang and Jakarta. Towards the end of the meeting, Mrs Tan reminded Mr Chui about the government`s view on gambling cruises. She advised him to have a lower proportion (30%) of CNWs and to have more destination cruises.
From 10 October 1995, the management of the plaintiff company was taken over entirely by the new shareholders and Mr Chui resigned as managing director. Nautican made its maiden call at the end of October and thereafter it settled into a regular sailing pattern using Singapore as its home base. According to Mr Purwadi, Nautican`s normal schedule was that on Saturday evening it would sail from Singapore on a CNW and return to port on Sunday morning. On Sunday evening it left for another CNW and returned again on Monday morning. Late Monday morning it would leave Singapore for Jakarta where it would arrive on Tuesday evening. Between Tuesday evening and Friday morning the vessel cruised to Semarang and Surabaya and sometimes to Bali. On Friday, it would leave Jakarta for Singapore, arriving on Saturday. It should be noted, however, that according to the sailing schedules which the plaintiffs submitted to PSA, there were some weeks in the first half of 1995 when the Nautican carried out two or three CNWs on weekdays in addition to its two weekend CNWs.
In January 1995, an inter office memorandum was circulated within PSA on the subject `CNW - Guidelines for Berth Allocation`. The following guidelines were put up for consideration: 
(i) all cruises with a published duration of less than 48 hours were to be considered CNW voyages, regardless of whether a destination had been included; 
(ii) operators were to be given three months to reduce the number of CNWs to less than 30% per month of total calls for each ship and after six months the number of CNW voyages was to be reduced to 15%; 
(iii) after the grace period, berths at the Cruise Centre would be allocated only for the quotas specified on a first-come-first serve basis.
The next development was that the GSB called a committee meeting for 15 February 1995. Prior to the meeting, it wrote to the other members of the committee. Its letter was headed `Gambling on the High Seas` and set out various measures to be discussed in order to `curb the illegal gambling activities on board cruise ships in (sic) the high seas`. Among these measures was a suggestion that PSA imposed a longer period for each cruise (a minimum of two nights) and that PSA should not grant berthing facilities to cruise ships that did only CNWs.
The committee meeting duly took place. As a follow-up, on 27 February, PSA sent an inter office memorandum entitled `Guidelines for Cruise Ships` to STPB and GSB. This memorandum set out the proposed conditions and the respective areas of responsibility of each organisation. It is not necessary to set out the conditions in detail here. Broadly, as regards PSA, it was in charge of allocating berths and was not to allocate berths to vessels which carried out only CNWs or had CNWs in excess of 30%. It would also refuse to allocate a berth to a vessel if GSB and STPB determined such action was necessary. STPB`s responsibility was to monitor both wholesome and undesirable activities on board cruise vessels through checks with the media, advertisements, and from other feedback and also to provide advice on the background of cruise lines and operators. GSB was to gather intelligence on gambling, vice, and other forms of illegal and undesirable activities on board cruise vessels and to take the necessary enforcement action to deter such undesirable activities.
Thereafter, there was further correspondence between the three parties and the guidelines were refined. They were finalised on 23 May 1995 and GSB then suggested to STPB that it might wish to organise a meeting with representatives of cruise operators based in Singapore so as to notify them of the guidelines. STPB duly invited all local cruise operators to a meeting at the premises of the CID on 22 June 1995. Mr Purwadi was unable to attend this meeting but he sent his technical superintendent, Mr Francis Wong and his crew manager, Mr William Woon, to it as the plaintiffs` representatives.
All three organisations were at the meeting. Mr Lee Loong Koon acted as moderator. He explained the rationale of PSA and STPB`s support for the development of the cruise business in Singapore but noted that despite constant communication by both of them to cruise operators based in Singapore, things were going in a direction which was contrary to the defendants` objective of developing wholesome family oriented and multi-destination cruises. The meeting was informed that the CID in consultation with STPB and PSA had agreed on a set of conditions to regulate and monitor casino activities on board cruise vessels especially those operating CNWs. Then, a representative from each organisation read out its conditions.
Mr Lee went first. The conditions he read out were as follows: 
 
 
(i) The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board shall monitor advertisements and the media on gaming activities on board cruise vessels and to (sic) liaise with the Port of Singapore Authority and the Gambling Suppression Branch, CID, if found in local, regional and international publications. 
 
(ii) Advise cruise vessels to put up proper and adequate signages (sic) in or around the casino area. 
 
(iii) Advise cruise operators, charterers and port agents that persons of 18 years and below shall not be allowed to participate in any form of casino gaming on board cruise vessels.
  
 
 
Then Mrs Kathleen Tan took over. She read out the following conditions: 
 
 
(i) Cruise vessels will not be allocated berthing facilities if the operators, charterers or port agents submit only `Cruise-to-nowhere` in their schedule. 
 
(ii) For a schedule covering three months, CNW cruises should not exceed 30% initially. Berths may not be allocated for CNW cruises in excess of the 30% initial limit. 
 
(iii) Cruises-to-nowhere` will be defined as cruises on vessels that leave a berth and return within 36 hours period. This is irrespective of whether a vessel calls at any other destination before returning to Singapore. 
 
(iv) The Port of Singapore Authority will refuse allocation of berth to a vessel if the Gambling Suppression Branch, CID and Singapore Tourist Promotion Board so (sic) determine that such action is necessary. 
 
(v) The Port of Singapore Authority shall not grant berthing facilities to cruise vessels that only offer casino gambling as its (sic) main form of entertainment.
  
 
 
The cruise operators were told by Mrs Tan that the CNW guidelines would take effect from 1 July 1995 for all new vessels and, in respect of vessels already using the Cruise Centre, from 1 October 1995. This meant that existing owners and operators had three months` notice of the implementation by PSA of the guidelines.
Next the GSB`s conditions were read out by its representative. It had only two conditions. First, that it would work closely with PSA and STPB to collate and be responsible for gathering intelligence on gaming and other undesirable activities on board cruise vessels. Secondly, it would liaise with the other two organisations before taking enforcement action against cruise vessels for such activities. The representative also informed the meeting that the police would not hesitate to take enforcement action against anyone who was involved in such activities and that the police had the authority to take action under the provisions of the Common Gaming Houses Act against any Singaporean caught gambling on board a cruise ship, irrespective of whether the vessel was in Singapore or international waters.
After the three authorities had completed their briefings, comments were sought from the cruise operators. Some response was received. One operator mentioned that he had made a commitment to some corporations to operate CNW once or twice a week from then till December 1995. He was prepared to show the committee his contract for authentication and STPB told him that they would be happy to discuss the matter further. Neither Mr Woon nor Mr Wong said anything at all at the meeting. It should be noted that the briefing was entirely oral. None of the organisations concerned handed out any written copies of their respective guidelines. The terms `conditions` and `guidelines` appear to have been used interchangeably during the meeting.
Events from 23 June to end 1995
At the time of the meeting, Mr Purwadi was in Jakarta. He was, however, briefed on what had occurred by Mr Woon and Mr Wong. He then arranged to meet Mr Lee at STPB`s office. This meeting took place on 4 July 1995. According to Mr Purwadi, he informed Mr Lee that the new guidelines were of grave concern to the plaintiff company as the same would effectively mean that the plaintiffs would be compelled to breach contracts entered into with Indonesian parties in February and March 1995 which committed them to providing two CNWs from Singapore each week. Mr Lee said that he would revert on various matters raised but no further information was received from him or PSA on the matter until 27 September 1995. Mr Lee`s account of the meeting was somewhat different. He said that he had briefed Mr Purwadi on the guidelines and their rationale and had invited him to write in to make representations regarding the 30% CNW limit if the plaintiffs had any difficulties. Mr Purwadi had not mentioned the plaintiffs` contracts with the Indonesian parties during the meeting.
Other cruise operators were not so reticent. They made representations to PSA and STPB of difficulties in the short term in complying with the 30% CNW guideline. These cruise operators were referred to STPB initially but their representations were jointly considered by all three bodies on a case-by-case basis. Some concessions were made. For example, a company named Star Cruises was allowed to operate itineraries for its fleet of five vessels which resulted in a 42% CNW component for the period October to December 1995. Three other vessels were allowed a CNW component of 33%, one was allowed 45.9% CNW and the fifth was granted a 50% CNW allowance.
Since 1993, PSA had been issuing circulars to all cruise lines and port agents notifying them that notification of a cruise ship`s schedules for each year after 31 December 1994 should be submitted to PSA at least one year in advance. A copy of this circular was given to the plaintiffs` representatives at the meeting they had with PSA on 6 October 1994. The plaintiffs did not, however, submit their cruise ship`s schedule at least a year in advance as requested by PSA. Instead, during the period December 1994 to June 1995, the longest advance notice that the plaintiffs gave PSA was two months and, in most cases the ANOPSS (advance notification of passenger ship`s schedule) was submitted in one month in respect of sailings for the next. On 18 July 1995, however, Mr Woon, as the plaintiffs` port agent, submitted ANOPSS covering the rest of the year. Nautican`s itinerary as disclosed by these schedules remained as it had been before the 22 June meeting ie the plaintiffs intended to have three sailings a week from Singapore of which two would be CNWs. CNWs would therefore comprise 66% of total cruises.
Mr Woon testified that after he had submitted it, he was often told by Mr Hudson Lim, an employee of PSA with whom he had regular contact in the course of his duties, that the sailing schedule should be amended to take into account the `oral guidelines` that had been announced on 22 June. The officer told Mr Woon that the schedules should be amended in order to enable him to give the plaintiffs berthing facilities.
On 27 September, PSA wrote to the plaintiffs stating that despite several reminders from them they had yet to receive the plaintiffs` revised schedule for Nautican which would fully meet with the 30% CNW guidelines. Based on the schedules which the plaintiffs had submitted for the period October - December 1995 (which had only 13 departures with Jakarta as a destination) only six CNW departures would be allowed. Accordingly, until the plaintiffs submitted the revised ANOPSS, PSA was only able to allocate a berth for Nautican for the 13 destination cruises and the first six CNW voyages on the schedule.
The plaintiffs responded by asking for a meeting with STPB to discuss Nautican`s berthing schedule. On 4 October 1995, they wrote to PSA stating that they were very surprised by the 27 September letter and disclosing that they had entered into contracts with parties in Indonesia such that if they varied the current position they might be exposed to legal suits. On 9 October, PSA responded in writing and reiterated its position that `we (STPB/CID/PSA) are not prepared to allow further CNW after 21 Oct 95 without the revision of her Oct-Dec `95 schedule to include additional destination cruises`.
The plaintiffs wrote immediately to both PSA and STPB. Their letter stated they understood that the committee would decide on the berthing prospects of all cruise vessels calling at Singapore. They repeated their statement that they had signed contracts in February and March 1995 and that if they varied the current position the plaintiffs might be exposed to legal suits. The plaintiffs went on to state they understood the committee would be having a meeting that week to discuss and decide on Nautican`s berthing allocation based on various appeals the plaintiffs had made to STPB. The plaintiffs asked the committee to review their position in the coming meeting and wanted to `sit before the committee` to explain their position.
The committee meeting was held on 12 October 1995. The plaintiffs were not invited to attend. It was decided by all three bodies that, as a concession, the plaintiffs should be allowed to operate one CNW every week which would mean that they had a CNW component of 50%. The plaintiffs were informed of this decision the same day but they were not satisfied. On 13 October 1995, they wrote again to STPB and PSA stating that the 50% limit would still put them in a dilemma and therefore they wanted to sit before the committee to `further explain/discuss and find a mutually satisfactory solution to the situation`. The committee refused the plaintiffs` request for a meeting. Mr Lee wrote to Mr Purwadi on 14 October 1995 stating that the committee had already accommodated the plaintiffs` business interests by granting the 50% CNW concession for the period October to December 1995 notwithstanding the announcement of the 30% limit in June 1995. Thus, no further concessions would be granted. Mr Lee added that if the committee considered that a meeting with the plaintiffs was necessary, it would notify them accordingly.
Further correspondence followed. On 20 October 1995 the plaintiffs appealed again for a change in the committee`s decision. This time they sent STPB a five page document setting out their arguments and the reasons why they should be allowed to maintain a 66% CNW component. In support, copies of their Indonesian contracts and the correspondence with their Indonesian contractors on the guidelines were attached.
In their letter of 16 October notifying the plaintiffs that they had been allowed to operate one CNW per week from Singapore up till 31 December 1995, PSA had suggested that to minimise the effect on the vessel`s existing schedule, Nautican did the CNW only on Sundays. PSA would facilitate this by allocating a berth for the vessel on its arrival from Jakarta each Saturday evening and it could then remain alongside until its CNW departure the next morning. The letter further stated that the arrangement could be effective from 28 October 1995 and asked the plaintiffs to submit their amended schedule on the ANOPSS form. No amended schedule was submitted by the plaintiffs.
On 26 October 1995, Mr Woon ascertained that PSA had not allocated any berths to Nautican for the weekend commencing 28 October. He telephoned Mr Hudson Lim about this and was told that Mr Pang Seng Joon of PSA had given instructions that all data relating to the scheduled visits of Nautican for the forthcoming weekend was to be deleted from PSA`s portnet system, the online computer database which gives details of the arrival and departure dates of vessels and the berths to which they have been allocated, if any. Mr Lim stated that the information on Nautican had been deleted as the plaintiffs had not amended its schedule to reflect the reduced number of CNWs.
On 28 October 1995, the plaintiffs` solicitors visited Mr Lee Loong Koon. According to Mr Lee, the solicitors asked for a 10 day grace period in order to enable them to go to Jakarta to explain the situation to the plaintiffs` contractors. Mr Lee indicated that he was prepared to support this request subject to PSA`s concurrence. PSA agreed and accordingly, later that morning, Mr Pang Seng Joon verbally informed Mr Woon that the ten-day extension had been granted. As a result, Nautican was allocated a berth for the weekend 28/29 October and the following weekend 4/5 November. The CNWs operated by the plaintiffs over those weekends were over and above the 50% quota the committee had previously granted.
The ten-day grace period expired on 6 November 1995. Mr Woon informed Mr Pang Seng Joon that he had no instructions regarding any change in schedule. PSA therefore wrote to STPB and GSB seeking their agreement to PSA`s proposal to deny a berth to Nautican for the weekend of 11/12 November. Both concurred with PSA`s proposal. On 7 November STPB informed the plaintiffs that PSA would deny Nautican berthing rights on 11 November. Despite requests made by the plaintiffs for a further extension on the basis that their director Mr Hassan was scheduled to meet Mr Lee Loong Koon on 14 November, PSA did not change its decision to deny the berth.
On 11 November 1995, the plaintiffs started this action and obtained an interim injunction against the denial of the berth. Nautican arrived in Singapore that evening and duly berthed at the Cruise Centre. It continued to berth in accordance with the plaintiffs` desired schedule until the injunction was discharged on 4 December 1995. In order, however, to assist the plaintiffs in making arrangements for the vessel, PSA informed them on 5 December 1995 that they were prepared to allow the plaintiffs to maintain their berth applications as originally submitted for berths for CNW until 18 December 1995 although the vessel had already exceeded its CNW quota. The plaintiffs availed themselves of this concession and the vessel used PSA`s berths for embarkation and disembarkation for passengers from Singapore for CNW on 9, 10 and 11 December 1995 and 16, 17 and 18 December 1995. Since 19 December 1995, Nautican has not called at Singapore at all.
On 2 January PSA issued `Singapore Cruise Centre Circular 1 of 1996`. This reduced what had formally been oral guidelines into writing. The Circular states: 
 
 
1 With a view to promoting wholesome family oriented activities and multi-destination cruises: 
 
(a) Cruise vessels that only offer casino gambling as its (sic) main form of entertainment shall not be granted any berthing facilities by the PSA. 
 
(b) No cruise vessel shall be allowed any berth without the express written permission of the PSA. 
 
(c) The PSA will not allocate any berthing facilities to a cruise vessel if the operators or their agents submit only Cruises-To-Nowhere in their schedule. 
 
(d) Cruises-To-Nowhere is defined as cruises on vessels that leave a berth and return within 36-hour period. This is irrespective [of] whether a vessel calls at any other foreign destination before returning to Singapore within the 36-hour period. 
 
(e) All cruise vessel must submit their schedule at least three months in advance. Cruises-To-Nowhere shall not exceed 30% of the total cruises over any three-month period for each vessel submitted in the proposed schedule. The PSA reserves its right not to grant any berth to any vessel for Cruises-To-Nowhere in excess of the 30% limit. 
 
(f) These guidelines may be revised at any time by the PSA, if in their sole and absolute discretion, they deem appropriate. 
 
(g) These guidelines are without prejudice to the PSA`s rights to refuse to provide berthing facilities to any cruise vessel for any other reason which, in their sole and absolute discretion, they deem appropriate.
  
 
 
 
 Legal background
 
As I have stated, the plaintiffs found their case in three branches of the law: public law, contract and tort. The public law branch is the one which engendered the main issues in the case. It is the most material branch because the basic question which has to be decided here relates to the use and regulation of the port. The plaintiffs, founding themselves on common law principles, maintained from the outset that they had a common law right to berthing facilities available in the Port of Singapore subject to payment of tariffs and compliance with properly promulgated regulations. A variation of this argument was that they had statutory and common law rights not to be denied such berthing facilities subject to the two matters mentioned earlier.
The basic legal position is that the public ports of a country belong, prima facie, to the sovereign or, in our context, the state. It is the state which has the exclusive right of erecting ports and harbours and assigning their limits. Once erected, a port ought to be free and open to all to go and come subject to the payment of proper tolls and dues since as an incident to a port there may be a right to take tolls and dues for its use. The public right of navigation in tidal waters includes a right of anchoring, mooring and grounding in the ordinary course of navigation. Sea ports, such as the ports of Singapore, are open in time of peace to all ships. See 36 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) paras 402, 403 and 406 and Vol 8 para 1014.. This common law principle may, however, be overridden by appropriate legislation especially where the matter of usage of the port`s facilities constructed by the state is concerned. The regulation of ports is, generally, vested in the state. As para 1016 of Vol 36 of 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 states: 
 
By the prerogative the Sovereign has the conservancy of all ports and harbours and is entrusted with the protection of public rights in such places. The grantee of a port takes its subject to the same obligations. The conservancy of ports is today largely regulated by statutory provisions. Every owner of a port is bound to conserve it so that it is reasonably fit for use as a port.
 
 
 
It is common ground that, at least until the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore Act 1996 (`the MPA Act`) came into effect in February 1996 (I will discuss the implications of that later), in Singapore PSA was the statutory corporation established to operate and regulate the port. This is clear from s 9 of the PSA Act, which imposes on PSA the duty, inter alia, to provide and maintain adequate and efficient port services and facilities in the port; to regulate and control navigation within the limits of the port; and to promote the use, improvement and the development of the port.
In order to fulfil its duties, PSA is by s 10 of the PSA Act, empowered to carry on such activities as appear to it to be advantageous, necessary or convenient for it to carry on for or in connection with the discharge of its duties. PSA is also authorised to exercise all or any of the powers specified in the Second Schedule of the PSA Act and any other written law. Of relevance here is cl 12 of that Schedule (`the Schedule`) which gives PSA the power `to control the erection and use of wharves, docks and any other works below high water mark within the limits of the port or the approaches to the port.` Further, the Singapore Port Regulations (Cap 236, 1990 Ed) reg 36 (`the Regulations`) provide, inter alia, as follows: 
 
Vessels Berthed Alongside
 
 
 
 
(1) No vessel shall occupy a berth at any Authority wharf except with the permission of the [PSA]. 
 
(2) Application for a berth shall be made by the owner, agent or master of the vessel in such form as may be approved by the [PSA]. 
 
(3) Such application shall be made at least 24 hours before the berth is required.
  
 
 
The term `Authority wharf` is defined in the Regulations as a `wharf, jetty or landing place owned, operated or controlled by the [PSA]`. In this connection it could not be disputed that the berths of the Singapore Cruise Centre fell within the definition of `authority wharf` since they had been built, and were operated, by PSA.
The plaintiffs, building on the duties of PSA as set out in the PSA Act, contend that PSA has a duty to provide port facilities, which would include berthing facilities, to the plaintiffs. As members of the public, the plaintiffs are entitled to insist on PSA complying with their statutory duty. They say PSA cannot deny berthing facilities to them unless they have proper reasons in law for doing so. As a body created by statute, PSA is subject to the doctrine of ultra vires, that is to say it can only do what is expressly authorised by or under the PSA Act or such things as are reasonably incidental to what is expressly authorised. As a public body, PSA`s actions are subject to judicial review and the court can intervene in its decisions and/or the implementation of such decisions on grounds that it has acted ultra vires the PSA Act and/or there has been illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety in the manner in which it has made or implemented its decisions. The important limitation here, which the plaintiffs recognise, is that judicial review is confined to a review of the decision making process and does not extend to a review of the decision itself. Even the findings of fact on which a decision is reached are generally not within the scope of the review. This is because the court`s power of judicial review of administrative action is a supervisory and not an appellate jurisdiction. See 
 Chan Hiang Leng Colin & Ors v PP 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 662
 and 
 R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Brind 
 
[1991] 1 AC 696
. As STPB is also a body created by statute, its decisions and actions are similarly subject to judicial review on the same basis.
 Legal issues arising in connection with judicial review
Bearing in mind the facts of this case and the complaints of the plaintiffs, the issues that have to be determined in the judicial review process here are first, whether PSA and STPB were acting lawfully and within their powers when they announced their respective guidelines on 22 June 1995. This issue involves a consideration of the powers of each organisation, including its ability to set guidelines to be observed by itself and/or third parties, and whether to be lawful such guidelines had to be contained in duly promulgated subsidiary legislation. The decision making process has also to be considered, ie whether there was any error of law or irrationality in the formulation of the guidelines. If these issues are resolved in favour of PSA and/or STPB, the next issue to be considered would be whether the PSA`s action in denying a berth to Nautican can be impugned in that PSA was not acting independently but under instructions from STPB and/or the GSB. The final issue in this regard is whether in making the decision to deny Nautican its berth, PSA acted in breach of the rules of natural justice.
 Legality of the various guidelines
I should make it clear that from hereon when I use the term `guidelines` I am referring to the conditions which the representatives of PSA and STPB read out to the seven local cruise operators who attended the meeting of 22 June 1995 as set out in paras 33 and 34 above. The guidelines were referred to in the documents, the evidence and in argument variously as `conditions`, `guidelines` and `berthing policy`, but their distinguishing characteristic is that although the internal documents of the defendants adduced in court show that they were drafted with some care, after discussion among the members of the committee, as far as the cruise operators were concerned they were not reduced to writing but were simply notified orally. Further, they were never the subject of any subsidiary legislation or written regulations issued by either of the defendants.
The first issue is whether PSA had the power to control the use of the berths at the Cruise Centre and what this power extended to. The Schedule, as recited above, empowers PSA to control the use of wharves within the limits of the port. Under reg 36 vessels are prohibited from using berths at authority wharves except with PSA`s permission and such permission must be sought by an application for a berth in PSA`s approved form. The construction which the plaintiffs put on these provisions is that PSA`s powers in relation to the occupation of berths are purely regulatory to ensure the proper physical use of the port and do not empower PSA to issue guidelines which deal with policy and the preferability of one type of cruise business over another.
As the plaintiffs read the PSA Act, it imposes a duty on PSA to maintain efficient port services and facilities, which facilities include berthing facilities for all vessels calling into Singapore. Section 9(c) of the PSA Act which states that it is PSA`s duty `to promote the use, improvement and development of the port` is relied on by the plaintiffs to buttress their argument that PSA`s duty is to promote the use of the port and by `use` the plaintiffs infer that what is meant is simply physical use and quantum of use. They say that neither s 9 nor s 10 nor any other provision of the PSA Act empowers PSA to issue guidelines to regulate or control gambling activities on the high seas and the regulation of such activities is totally extraneous to PSA`s powers and duties. In announcing the guidelines for the purpose of controlling gambling on the high seas, the plaintiffs contend that PSA has breached its statutory duties to provide and maintain efficient port services and facilities to promote the use of the port.
PSA, however, takes a wider view of its duties and abilities at the material time. It argues, and I agree, that its discretion under para 12 of the Schedule and reg 36 was not limited to control of navigation, vessel movements and cargo operations. This is because under s 9 of the PSA Act, PSA was given various specific duties in regard to navigation including regulating it and disseminating navigational information and was also given in separate sub-sections the duties to provide and maintain port services and facilities and to promote the use, improvement and development of the port. As these duties have been differentiated in the legislation, I do not think that PSA`s duty to develop and improve the port and promote its use can be limited to simply the provision of physical services and acts relating to the control of navigation. Those duties must be read more widely than the plaintiffs contend. Further, there is nothing in s 10(1) of the PSA Act or in any other provision of the legislation requiring such limitation to be implied.
From the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in para 12 of the Schedule and reg 36, it is clear that PSA has a discretion in deciding which vessels can use which berths. In particular, the formulation of reg 36 gives PSA ample power to refuse permission to any vessel to use a berth. The only limitation which has to be read into PSA`s discretion in giving or refusing permission to a cruise vessel to use a berth is the requirement that the discretion must be exercised for the discharge of PSA`s duties under the PSA Act and there must not be any irrationality or procedural impropriety in the exercise of the discretion. Nothing in the governing legislation requires PSA in deciding whether to allocate a berth to a cruise vessel to have regard only to navigational matters or to the physical availability of the berth or to the requirement of filling up as many berths as possible at any time.
The plaintiffs relied on the English cases of 
 The Guelder Rose 
 (1927) 136 LT 226 and 
 Pearn v Sargent 
 [1973] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 141 and certain passages from 
 The Law of Harbours and Pilotage 
 (4th Ed) by Douglas and Geen to support their contention that the discretion of PSA under para 12 of the Schedule and reg 36 was limited to controlling navigation, vessel movement and cargo operation. I agree, however, with the submission made on behalf of PSA, that these authorities are not helpful because of the different statutory regimes governing the situations in England and Singapore. The cases turned on the interpretation of the English Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act 1847. The relevant sections of that statute were worded differently from the legislation which is in issue here and, as far as the overall regime was concerned, s 33 of the English Act provided: 
 
Harbour, dock and pier to be free to the public on payment of rates.
 
 
 
Upon payment of the rates made payable by this and the Special Act, and subject to the other provisions thereof, the harbour, dock and pier shall be open to all persons for the shipping and unshipping of goods, and the embarking and landing of passengers.
 
 
 
It would be noted from the above that the English scheme in relation to the use of harbours, docks and piers was worded positively and gave the public the right to use the facilities subject to the payment of the prescribed rates. The Singapore scheme is, on the other hand, phrased rather negatively in that reg 36 expressly provides that no vessel shall occupy a berth at a PSA wharf except with PSA`s permission. This form of wording gives PSA a discretion in formulating conditions for the use of the wharves which discretion was not available to the authority which managed the harbours, docks and piers governed by s 33 of the English Act. In this connection, I do not find any merit in the plaintiffs` point that by reason of para 27(a) of PSA`s defence, PSA cannot rely on reg 36. Paragraph 13 of PSA`s defence specifically states that PSA is relying on this regulation and when that defence is read as a whole it is clear that nothing in para 27(a) prejudices para 13.
I now turn to the impact of the MPA Act upon the powers and duties of PSA. The plaintiffs submit that this Act, which came into force on 2 February 1996, completely divests PSA of its regulatory functions on matters relating to port services, berthing and denials of berths. Therefore, all denials of berth after 2 February 1996 by PSA based on policy considerations relating to CNW and gambling on the high seas would be illegal.
According to its preamble, the MPA Act was passed to establish and incorporate the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (`MPA`) and to provide for its functions and powers. Under s 7 of the MPA Act, it is the duty of MPA, among other things, to promote the use, improvement and development of the port and to regulate and control navigation within the port, to provide navigational information and aids, and to exercise licensing and regulatory functions in respect of marine and port services and facilities.
When the MPA Act came into force, s 9 of the PSA Act was amended by removing all references to the regulation of navigation and provision of navigational aids and information. This is because those functions had been transferred to MPA. The PSA Act was not repealed in its entirety and PSA continues to exist and to perform several statutory functions. Of particular relevance to this case is the fact that sub-clauses (a) and (c) of s 9 remain intact and it continues to be the duty of PSA to promote the use, improvement and development of the port. Section 10(1) of the PSA Act and para 12 of the Schedule were not affected either.
Regulation 36 also remains in force although s 66 of the PSA Act, the section under which the Regulations were initially promulgated, has been substantially amended by the deletion of several of the sub-paragraphs detailing the matters in respect of which regulations may be made. This is because first, under s 121(2) of the MPA Act, any subsidiary legislation made under the repealed provisions of the PSA Act and in force immediately before 2 February 1996 shall, insofar as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of the MPA Act, continue in force until it is revoked or repealed by subsidiary legislation made under that Act. So far there has been no subsidiary legislation under the MPA Act revoking or repealing reg 36 and that regulation is not inconsistent with any provision of the MPA Act. Secondly, various sub-paragraphs of s 66(1) of the PSA Act dealing with the regulation and use of wharves and docks still remain as part of that section and have not been affected by the repeal of the other sub-paragraphs which are those relating to matters, especially navigation, which are now under the control of MPA. Accordingly, at all material times both before and after the coming into force of the MPA Act, PSA had the power under s 66 of the PSA Act to make regulations governing the use of its berths and the manner in which it would exercise the discretion it had properly given itself to grant or refuse permission for cruise vessels to use the berths at the Singapore Cruise Centre.
The plaintiffs` next argument is that even if the court accepts that PSA had the power to control the use of its berths, that power had to be exercised through the promulgation of regulations pursuant to s 66 and since the guidelines were never officially promulgated regulations, they were not enforceable and could not be relied upon by PSA to justify the denial of a berth to Nautican. Before I go on to consider this issue I will deal with the position of STPB.
It is the plaintiffs` contention that STPB lacks the power to do the things that it did in relation to this action including its participation in the committee and its contribution to the formulation of the guidelines. They also contend that the TPB Act contains a very `restrictive` scheme of things. In fact, the STPB has very wide statutory powers set out in s 14 of the TPB Act. These powers are not limited by any section imposing duties on STPB. The primary function of STPB is to promote tourism for Singapore and consequently it has been conferred by Parliament with powers to: 
(i) engage in, assist or promote the improvement of facilities for visitors to Singapore and the development of Singapore as a holiday resort: s 14(b); 
(ii) secure overseas publicity for Singapore`s tourist attractions: s 14(c); 
(iii) co-ordinate the activities of persons providing services for visitors to Singapore: s 14(d); 
(iv) make recommendations to the government in relation to any measures which may be taken with a view to increasing the number of visitors to Singapore: s 14(j); 
(v) generally do all such matters and things as may be incidental or consequential upon the exercise of its powers or in the discharge of its duties under the TPB Act: s 14(p).
Since the cruise industry can be a major tourist industry, the powers granted to STPB under s 14 clearly allowed it: to develop the cruise industry; to form views as to the direction in which this industry would move and how it should develop; to form views as to what was considered desirable for the development of the industry; to take note of what it considered was an adverse development; to form a view as to what it felt was a good image for Singapore as a cruise centre and hub for the region and good for Singapore as a tourist destination; to give advice or make recommendations to other government bodies or statutory boards on matters pertaining to tourism and tourist enterprises; to form a view whether having cruise vessels performing too many CNWs was bad for the development of the cruise industry of Singapore; to form a view as to what should be done to cut down the incidence of CNWs from Singapore and to participate in the committee (as an ad hoc grouping of governmental organisations) and its deliberations on the problem of excessive gambling on CNWs.
Section 25 of the TPB Act provides that STPB may, with the approval of the minister, make regulations generally for carrying out the provisions of the TPB Act. Because of this, in relation to STPB too, the plaintiffs argue that any activity on the part of TPB to promote or regulate the cruise industry had to be effected through the medium of a properly passed regulation. It should be pointed out here that in relation to the making of the Regulations, the language used both in s 25 of the TPB Act and s 66(1) of the PSA Act is `may, with the approval of the Minister, make resolutions `. The word `may` in this context is permissive and has an empowering rather than a mandatory effect. Neither PSA nor STPB is required by the relevant legislation to pass regulations unless they deem fit.
As counsel for STPB pointed out, the plaintiffs` submission that if a statutory corporation like PSA or STPB wished to form a view or a policy or a guideline on the number of CNWs cruise vessels could operate or on the promotion of wholesome oriented activities on cruise ships, then it must do so by way of a duly promulgated regulation, is an astounding one. If this is the way government and statutory boards have to work then everything would come to a grinding halt while policy decisions had to be communicated to the Attorney-General`s Chambers, then drafted into regulations and then the drafts approved by the organisation concerned before being sent on to Parliament and effected by gazette notification. That is not the way the executive arm of any common law country functions.
The plaintiffs` submission, in fact, shows a misunderstanding of `executive` or `administrative` acts, and the functions of government or government agencies and the legislature. As explained in para A-011 of 
 Judicial Review of Administrative Action 
 by de Smith, Woolf and Jowell (5th Ed) at p 1006: 
 
A distinction often made between legislative and administrative acts is that between the general and the particular. A legislative act is the creation and promulgation of a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases: an administrative act cannot be exactly defined, but it includes the adoption of a policy, the making and issue of a specific direction, and the application of a general rule to a particular case in accordance with the requirements of policy of expediency or administrative practice.
 
 
 
Government policy is regularly effected through quasi autonomous organisations operating more or less at arm`s length from government (ibid at pp 28 and 29).
The legislative framework provides that STPB is to engage in assist or promote the improvement of facilities for visitors to Singapore and the development of Singapore as a holiday resort, to secure overseas publicity for the tourist attractions of Singapore and to make recommendations as to measures which would increase the number of visitors to Singapore. However, how and what facilities are to be promoted or improved or what channels or devices are employed to secure overseas publicity for the tourist attraction of Singapore are left to STPB to decide. Which countries STPB targets to publicise Singapore in is policy and an administrative decision left to STPB to decide.
Similarly the legislative framework provides that PSA is to provide and maintain adequate and efficient port facilities and services and to promote the use, improvement and development of the port. However, how and what facilities and services are to be promoted or improved and what the best use would be for the port in the context of Singapore as a whole are policy and administrative matters left to PSA to decide and implement in whatever manner is most appropriate in the circumstances.
The legal authorities also confirm that STPB and PSA being charged with a discretionary power, albeit within a statutory framework, to carry out their functions and duties, are entitled to adopt a general policy in the exercise of their statutory duties and powers without having to pass regulations or by laws for each policy, a fortiori when a policy only deals with a few individual cases of a very special and small segment of the industries within their respective jurisdictions. For example, in 
 Re Findlay 
 
[1985] AC 318
 at pp 335-336, Lord Scarman discussing the plaintiffs` challenges to a policy adopted by the English Home Secretary in relation to the release of prisoners on parole, stated: 
 
For myself, I have difficulty in understanding how a Secretary of State could properly manage the complexities of his statutory duty without a policy
 
 
 
the duty of the Secretary of State in this case is, as I have shown, a very complex one. Indeed the complexities are such that an approach based on a carefully formulated policy could be said to be called for. There is, as I understand the law, nothing to prevent such an approach, where it is appropriate.
 
 
 
The legitimacy of adopting a policy in the exercise of an administrative decision has been recognised by the court. In a tribunal case Banks LJ. had this to say, 
 R v Port of London Authority, ex p Kynoch Ltd
. 
[1919] 1 K.B. 176
, 184:
 
 
 
`In the present case there is another case to be borne in mind. There are on the one hand cases where a tribunal in the honest exercise of its discretion has adopted a policy, and, without refusing to hear an applicant, intimates to him what its policy is, and that after hearing him it will in accordance with its policy decide against him, unless there is something exceptional in his case. I think counsel for the applicants would admit that, if the policy has been adopted for reasons which the tribunal may legitimately entertain, no objection could be taken to such a course. On the other hand there are cases where a tribunal has passed a rule, or come to a determination, not to hear any application of a particular character by whomsoever made. There is a wide distinction to be drawn between these two classes.`

The cases show that the adoption of a general policy by a body exercising an administrative discretion is perfectly valid provided that: 
(i) the policy is not unreasonable in the special sense given to the term in [1948] 1 KB 176, ie it is not a decision that is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it or that no reasonable person could have come to such a view: see also 
[1985] 1 AC 374
 
(ii) in considering unreasonableness in the sense, the courts are not entitled to substitute their views of how the discretion should be exercised with that actually taken: see 
[1994] 3 SLR 662
 nor is unreasonableness established if the courts merely come to the view that such a policy or guideline may not work effectively as another since the courts are not exercising an appellate function in respect of administrative decisions (supra, note 9 at p 414); and the burden of proving that the policy or guideline is illegal or ultra vires is on the plaintiffs: see `s case; 
(iii) they are made known to the persons so affected; and 
(iv) neither PSA nor STPB fetters its discretion in the future and is prepared to hear out individual cases or is prepared to deal with exceptional cases: see `s case and also 
[1971] AC 610
.
 Were the guidelines unreasonable?
Having decided that PSA had the power to formulate a policy on the use of the berths at the Cruise Centre and that STPB had the power to formulate policies relating to the cruise industry as a tourist related industry, the next issue which arises is whether the policies that they arrived at as evidenced by the guidelines can be challenged on the basis that they were unreasonable in the 
 Wednesbury 
 sense or that in formulating them the defendants took into account irrelevant matters or disregarded relevant matters.
PSA`s duty under s 9(c) of the PSA Act is to promote the use, improvement and development of the port. I have said that this duty has to be construed widely and that PSA would not be doing its duty if the sole aim of its policies was to increase the amount of tonnage which uses the port and the amount of revenue that it could collect from the port`s services and facilities. PSA is entitled when considering the promotion of the port to have regard to wider considerations such as the promotion of desirable businesses and the restriction of undesirable businesses. In deciding what businesses are desirable and what are not, PSA is entitled to take into account the views of other government bodies like the police.
It was clear from the evidence that in relation to the cruise industry, PSA`s objective from the outset was to develop the port into a cruise hub for multi-destination cruising in the ASEAN region with major cruise operators positioning their cruise vessels here. As the industry developed, however, PSA became concerned that the prevalence of undesirable activities in that industry would impede its efforts at promoting and developing the port as a cruise hub. The term `undesirable activities` refers to gambling, loan sharking and prostitution on cruise ships on the high seas. The purpose of the guidelines was to curtail the undesirable activities.
Mrs Tan`s evidence was that PSA`s concerns were based on the following factors: 
(i) That the undesirable activities would tarnish the image and reputation of the port as it would become known as a hub for gambling cruises. This would discourage major cruise operators from positioning their vessels here as they would not be convinced that there is a potential market for their wholesome family oriented cruise products. 
(ii) Mrs Tan`s information was that major cruise operators are discouraged from using Singapore as a cruise hub by the information they are getting about gambling activities taking place on vessels plying from Singapore. This is because such operators are unable to compete in a market where others offer low basic cruise fares to attract passengers and rely on high gambling revenue for profit. 
(iii) If Singapore becomes a hub for gambling cruises, habitual gamblers will form a high proportion of passengers taking cruises from Singapore. This will deter other people, who form a potentially larger market of passengers for cruises than habitual gamblers, from taking cruises from Singapore.
According to Mrs Tan, PSA decided that to protect and promote the image and reputation of the port and to attract major cruise operators to use the port as a cruise hub, it would have to curtail the undesirable activities, at least in relation to their connection with Singapore. At the same time it wished to promote more multi-destination cruises with wholesome family activities from Singapore because this would help attract passengers from mature cruise markets such as America and Europe to join cruises in this region. This in turn would bring major cruise operators to our port.
The evidence, both oral and documentary, which PSA presented confirmed that the guidelines were formulated and adopted by PSA for the foregoing reasons. It was PSA`s submission that in formulating and adopting the guidelines especially the 30% limit on CNWs emanating from Singapore, it took into account the following matters: 
(i) that the undesirable activities occurred mainly on cruise vessels engaged in CNWs from Singapore. PSA`s belief that this was so was based on press reports, articles in trade journals, feedback from members of the public and feedback from STPB and GSB. 
(ii) to allow CNWs to proliferate would be contrary to PSA`s objective of having more multi-destination cruises from Singapore. 
(iii) a restriction of the number of CNWs each cruise could undertake would, it was hoped, both curtail the undesirable activities and, at the same time, promote more multi-destination cruises. 
(iv) a certain number of CNWs would be beneficial for three reasons: first, as a filler to minimise idle time of cruise vessels in between destination cruises; secondly to introduce passengers from Singapore and the region who had never cruised to the cruise experience; and finally, to cater for company charters. 
(v) since the local cruise industry was at an infant stage to completely prohibit CNWs would stifle its growth. 
(vi) the 30% limit on CNWs was not, PSA submitted, an arbitrary figure but was based on the following factors: 
(a) as it was PSA`s objective to promote more multi-destination cruises, the number of multi-destination cruises undertaken by any cruise vessel from Singapore would have to be more than its CNWs from here; 
(b) in PSA`s view a ratio of two destination cruise departure to one CNW departure from Singapore per week was a fair ratio to start with in order to provide for the legitimate CNWs; 
(c) the 2:1 ratio which worked out to about 30% of CNW departures over a three month period was a ratio which had been achieved by the cruise vessel Song of Flower; 
(vii) finally, PSA and STPB had met with cruise operators to discuss the 30% limit and these operators had, generally, been agreeable to that limit.
In his evidence Mr Purwadi suggested that the way in which PSA had calculated the 30% limit on CNWs was unfair. In his view, a fairer calculation would be based on the ratio of the number of days on which a cruise vessel was actually engaged on CNWs to the number of days on which it was actually engaged on destination cruises (the daily basis). The basis adopted by PSA, the call basis, was on the ratio of the number of CNW departures from Singapore to the number of destination cruise departures from Singapore. Its justification for adopting the call basis, according to Mrs Tan, was: 
(i) if the daily basis is used then it would be possible for a cruise vessel to depart from Singapore on a single destination cruise to say Penang, and remain there for 30 days and thereafter claim to be entitled to undertake 10 CNWs from Singapore; 
(ii) PSA would not know what activities the cruise vessel would be engaged in during the 30 days during which it was away from Singapore but would still have to allow that vessel 10 CNW departures from Singapore for undertaking that single destination cruise. The result would be contrary to PSA`s objective of promoting more multi-destination cruises from Singapore; 
(iii) the call basis would ensure that each cruise vessel maintained a 2:1 ratio of destination cruise departures to CNW departures from Singapore per week and therefore would serve the aim of promoting more multi-destination cruises from Singapore.
In my judgment PSA`s reasons do stand up to scrutiny. In any event, bearing the circumstances in mind, it cannot be seriously contended that the call basis is so outrageous in its defiance of logic that no sensible person in the position of PSA could have arrived at it.
The main basis on which the plaintiffs attack the formulation of the guidelines is their contention that an irrelevant factor was taken into account when the guidelines was drawn up. They point out that it is clear from PSA`s defence and from the evidence given by Mrs Tan that PSA viewed the activities of gambling, money-lending and prostitution even when conducted on the high seas, as `illegal activities`. Part of PSA`s pleaded position is because these activities are illegal, they would tarnish the image of Singapore, which would adversely affect PSA`s effort to develop and promote the port. Further, STPB also considered that gambling on board cruise ships was illegal. In his affidavit of evidence in chief, Mr Lee stated that STPB`s concerns relating to undesirable developments on board cruise vessels culminated suggestions by the CID in February 1995 that a multi-agency approach be taken by STPB, PSA and the CID `to curb illegal gambling activities on board cruise ships`. He further states `to this end, conditions were proposed and agreed upon by the three bodies as to the role to be performed by each body in curbing illegal gambling activities on board cruise ships`.
Mrs Tan confirmed that the GSB had told her that the undesirable activities were illegal and she accepted this as being the correct position. She also stated that based on what GSB had told her, she believed that the activities would be illegal so long as they were undertaken by Singaporeans who had boarded the cruise ship in Singapore. Mrs Tan took GSB`s communications as being official communicates that these activities would be illegal even when conducted in international waters. She also admitted that the perception that the activities were illegal was one of the considerations for PSA when it worked out its policy on berthing.
The plaintiffs point out that no evidence was introduced to establish that when gambling, prostitution and money-lending take place on vessels cruising on the high seas, these activities are illegal under Singapore law per se. Neither was any evidence introduced to establish that such activities undertaken on the high seas by Singaporean passengers on cruise ships originating from Singapore are illegal. That being the case, neither PSA nor STPB was able to establish any legal basis for its belief that the undesirable activities are also illegal and that to allow such illegal activities to continue would tarnish the image of the Port of Singapore. Accordingly, the plaintiffs argue that whatever the defendants may say were the other factors taken into account in formulating the guidelines, the main consideration which swayed the defendants and led to their implementation was their perception that the activities were illegal. As this perception had no basis in fact, it was an irrelevant factor and thus there was a serious defect in the decision making process which must affect the validity of the decision made.
I have considered the plaintiffs` arguments on this issue with some care. It cannot be denied that at the time the guidelines were drawn up both defendants considered, on the advice of the GSB, a government body which could reasonably be presumed to know the law on such matters, that gambling on the high seas by Singaporeans who had boarded a cruise vessel in Singapore was illegal. Neither can the defendants deny that they were influenced to some extent by this belief. The point is whether that belief was the substantial reason for the implementation of the guidelines. The evidence is that it was not. It was one of the factors but not the only one and certainly not the deciding factor. If it had been a really substantial factor, PSA would, I believe, have banned CNWs altogether as requested by GSB instead of allowing a 30% quota. I accept the evidence of the defendants as given above that various considerations went into the formulation of the guidelines in general and the 30% limit in particular and, having regard to those considerations and the objectives of both PSA and STPB in relation to the development of the cruise industry in Singapore, I cannot come to the conclusion that the guidelines are so irrational and outrageous in their defiance of logic that, even on the basis that the undesirable activities were perfectly legal, no reasonable authority would ever have drawn them up.
The fact remains that howsoever legal the activities might have been the defendants had grounds for their firm belief that to allow the activities to continue unchecked would be counterproductive to the declared aims of the defendants in promoting the development of the cruise industry in Singapore and would give the Port of Singapore an unenviable reputation, to say the least, in international cruise circles. The defendants` views on the undesirability of allowing gambling cruises to proliferate were not formed on the basis of any belief engendered by GSB that gambling in international waters was illegal. The evidence shows that as far back as in the first year of operation of the Singapore Cruise Centre, PSA had noted the appearance of gambling cruises and had formed the view that Singapore`s image as a cruise hub could be tainted, and PSA`s objective of developing the industry could be stymied, if Singapore was associated with gambling cruises.
I should also point out that although Mrs Tan was pressed during cross-examination to admit that the basis for the introduction of a quota on CNWs was excessive illegal activities, irrespective of whether they were conducted within the territorial waters of Singapore or on the high seas, she refuted the suggestion firmly. She asserted, and I believed, that the basis of the quota system was the curbing of undesirable activities occurring on cruises undertaken by cruise ships which use the port of Singapore. Later, in her re-examination, she confirmed that the reason for the quota decision was the prevalence of the undesirable activities and not their illegal nature and that even if she were informed now that the activities were legal, the quota would remain. The evidence adduced substantiates this. PSA`s concerns had been indicated as far back as April 1993 in a management paper which was produced to explain the need for guidelines for the cruise industry.
The plaintiffs also attacked the guidelines on the basis that they had been drawn up and implemented by a committee that had no existence at law and therefore were invalid. This is a non issue for two reasons. First, there is nothing unlawful or illegal or even intrinsically wrong in PSA and/or STPB and/or the GSB setting up an ad hoc committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each organisation makes its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The evidence is that the organisations first got together in April 1993 to deal with the problem of the Regent Spirit. More than a year later, as reports of gambling activities continued, the GSB contacted the other two bodies again and the ad hoc committee was formed to exchange ideas and adopt a `multi-agency` approach to consider and deal with a situation which all three, for varying reasons, considered to be of concern to them. The three organisations discussed matters and exchanged information and opinions and by consensus arrived at some conclusions as to the best course of action to be adopted by each body which was within its respective powers and jurisdiction.
Secondly, the committee did not act as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action to be taken was, as the evidence establishes, left to each organisation to implement what was within its respective powers. There was no chairman at the 22 June 1995 meeting, as one would expect if the committee had functioned as an entity. There was only a moderator and each party read out the guidelines which it would itself be adopting and implementing. The plaintiffs` own evidence confirmed the defendants` accounts of what occurred at the meeting.
I am satisfied from the evidence that each of the defendants had the final say on what its role would be and on the form the guidelines it would implement would take. In relation to each of PSA and STPB the guidelines were self-initiated and although all the members of the committee discussed the various drafts no views were imposed by any one, or indeed by the committee as an entity, on any other member. Mr Lee testified that he would not presume to tell or order PSA to deny or grant a berth to any vessel and Mrs Tan, for her part, said that even if the committee as an entity came to a decision, it could only be implemented if approved by her superior officer in PSA.
Other considerations relating to adoption of a general policy
As I mentioned earlier one of the other conditions for the validity of the adoption of a general policy by a body exercising an administrative discretion is that that policy must be made known to the persons affected by it. In this case there is overwhelming evidence that the guidelines were made known to and understood by all persons who could possibly be affected by them although they were announced orally and no written formulation was given to anyone prior to January 1996.
The plaintiffs themselves confirmed that they knew as early as 6 October 1994 that PSA was encouraging cruise operators to adopt a 30% limit for their CNWs. Mr Purwadi admitted this in court. Further, at the time STPB informed all cruise operators of the proposed meeting on 22 June 1995, the plaintiffs were aware that at this meeting guidelines were going to be introduced which would affect their cruising itineraries. As the evidence demonstrated, all affected cruise operators attended that meeting and heard the announcement of the guidelines. They were then asked for their comments and questions were taken and answered. Mr Woon agreed that he was given an opportunity to give the plaintiffs` comments but did not do so as he wished to refer the matter to his senior management. He confirmed, however, that at the end of the meeting he was clear as to what the guidelines were all about. Mr Purwadi also confirmed that he was clear as well as to what the 30% CNW restriction was.
The next consideration is whether there was any fettering of the administrative discretion vested in the defendants. The first point here can be dealt with briefly. It is obvious from the evidence that the guidelines were not rigidly enforced. From the very beginning PSA made it clear that it was willing to consider representations from cruise operators and make exceptions to the 30% restriction if the circumstances so required. The cruise operators were asked to contact STPB which in turn put up their cases before the committee. The evidence shows that a number of concessions were made and that the guidelines were applied in a flexible manner. Exceptional cases were given due consideration.
The second point here is the plaintiffs` contention that vis a vis PSA the guidelines are illegal in that PSA has purported to fetter its own discretion by agreeing to take instructions from STPB and GSB on the denial of berths to cruise ships. This challenge is based on condition (iv) which reads: 
 
The Port of Singapore Authority will refuse allocation of berth to a vessel if the Gambling Suppression Branch, CID and Singapore Tourist Promotion Board so (sic) determine that such action is necessary.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs are correct in their submission that PSA as the authority entrusted with the control over berths and, accordingly, the discretion as to how such berths are to be allocated, has also the duty to exercise that discretion itself after considering various relevant factors. It cannot abrogate this responsibility by taking orders from other statutory boards unless it is under a legal duty to do so. PSA did not contend that it was under any legal duty to obey orders from either GSB or STPB in regard to the allocation or denial of berths in the cruise centre. I must therefore agree with the plaintiffs` submission that in so far as condition (iv) appears to be a direction by PSA to itself to take orders from either GSB or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels it is a fetter on the proper exercise by PSA of its discretion and is therefore invalid.
I do not agree, however, that condition (iv) in itself invalidates all the guidelines as they are capable of being implemented without reference at all to condition (iv). Whilst theoretically PSA has agreed to take orders from GSB and STPB, whether it in fact does so is another matter. If PSA`s decision to deny Nautican a berth was made on the basis of condition (iv), ie that it had been ordered by STPB and GSB to do so, then that decision would be invalid as PSA had not exercised its discretion in coming to the decision. If, however, the decision was PSA`s alone, then condition (iv) would be irrelevant and would not operate to invalidate it. This brings me to the next issue which relates to the manner in which Nautican was denied a berth.
Did PSA exercise its discretion in refusing Nautican a berth?
It is the plaintiffs` case that PSA did not exercise its discretion itself not only with regard to the denial of a berth to Nautican on 11 November 1995 but also in all subsequent decisions. The basis of this latter allegation is that after 11 November 1995 PSA continued to seek recommendations from STPB and GSB although there was no formal meeting of the committee after the interim injunction was issued. The plaintiffs do not contend, however, that PSA acted at the behest of GSB. Their case is that it acted on the directions of Mr Lee of the STPB. This allegation calls for a detailed examination of the evidence.
The guidelines were announced on 22 June 1995. As Nautican was already operating from Singapore, under the guidelines as announced, it would have to observe the 30% CNW limit as from 1 October 1995 unless a concession was granted. The defendants had made it clear to the cruise operators at the June meeting that they were prepared to consider representations from the operators as to problems that the guidelines would cause them.
On 4 July 1995, Mr Purwadi met Mr Lee. Here was a perfect opportunity for the plaintiffs to inform the defendants of the difficulties caused by the guidelines. According to Mr Purwadi, he took this opportunity and told Mr Lee and Mr Poon about his difficulties, his Indonesian contracts and his contractual obligations. Mr Lee`s reply was that he would look into it and explain the situation to PSA. Thereafter Mr Purwadi was waiting for a reply and for that reason that the plaintiffs did nothing further until late September. Instead they submitted an ANOPSS form under which Nautican would carry on as usual up to the end of 1995. STPB`s version, on the other hand, is that no indication was given by Mr Purwadi of the existence of the Indonesian contracts which the plaintiffs were obliged to perform. All that happened was that Mr Lee told Mr Purwadi that the plaintiffs were free to write in to make representations regarding the 30% CNW limit and that any representations made would be given due consideration.
Mr Purwadi had also claimed that before he chartered Nautican he had met Mr Pang Seng Joon, Mr Robert Soo and Mr Michael Loh from PSA at PSA`s office. During this meeting, Mr Purwadi informed PSA of the plaintiffs` plans to charter Nautican and operate her as a cruise ship from Singapore. He showed the PSA officers a copy of the plaintiffs` brochure and told them that his sailing schedule had two CNWs a week. The PSA officers told him specifically that his schedule was all right.
I am not able to accept Mr Purwadi`s evidence on what occurred either at the meeting with PSA in 1994 or at the July 1995 meeting with STPB. His assertions do not accord with the way he actually behaved. On 27 September 1995, PSA sent the plaintiffs a letter asking them to amend their sailing schedule as otherwise it would not be able to allocate a berth for CNW departures after 21 October 1995. Instead of replying immediately to say first, that he had been assured in 1994 that two CNWs a week were perfectly in order and, secondly, that he had made representations to Mr Lee on which he was awaiting a reply, Mr Purwadi wrote to PSA only on 4 October 1995. His letter simply stated that the plaintiffs were surprised by PSA`s communication and wanted to know whether it was a PSA or STPB imposition. In none of the subsequent correspondence was there any mention of the two meetings and their purported contents.
Further, in his evidence Mr Purwadi maintained that he was very surprised and shocked at the imposition of the guidelines. Under cross-examination, however, he admitted that he had known about the meeting of 6 October 1994 between PSA and Daniel Chui and the restriction that was told to the latter because it affected the charter and that he had raised the charter and the restriction with Mr Chui shortly after that meeting. He admitted also that he had been briefed quite comprehensively by his employees about the June 1995 meeting and that after the 4 July meeting, PSA`s Hudson Lim had often asked him to amend his schedule.
I find it incredible that after all the above had happened, Mr Purwadi could insist that he was surprised and shocked at the guidelines. What is even more telling is that no mention or protest was made in any of the correspondence of the incidents referred to above or the intrinsic unfairness of PSA`s going back on its word. All that Mr Purwadi could give as an explanation for his non-action was that since the assurances had been given to him verbally, it was not good for him to protest in writing. This explanation cannot be believed because after PSA`s `ultimatum` he generated voluminous correspondence in the course of his protests and requests that Nautican be allowed to follow its original schedule.
In my judgment, the first time that the plaintiffs informed the defendants of their alleged contractual obligations to Indonesian parties was by their letter of 4 October 1995 which stated `We must disclose that we have entered into contracts with parties in Indonesia such that if we vary the current position, our company may be exposed to legal suits.` The use of the words `we must disclose` is significant. Those words categorically imply that the information is being given for the first time. Further, the plaintiffs merely asserted the fact of existing contractual obligations. No details whatsoever of the same were given to the defendants, even in the plaintiffs` follow up letter of 9 October 1995.
Notwithstanding the dearth of information and lack of substantiating documents, the defendants decided to re-consider the position of the plaintiffs. A committee meeting was held on 12 October 1995 and, after considering the plaintiffs` appeal, the committee decided to grant the plaintiffs the 50% CNW concession for the period from October to December 1995. This concession, which was the highest given to any of the cruise operators, was made on the basis of the alleged Indonesian contracts. I find that the decision of the committee was a consensual one made by the representatives of all three parties. It is pertinent to note that Mr Lee was not present at the meeting and that STPB was represented by Mr Liow who only advised Mr Lee of the concession after the latter`s return from his trip abroad. There is no evidence to support any contention that PSA in acceding to the concession was acting under the direction of STPB or that it did not come to its decision on the point on an independent basis.
The plaintiffs, as stated earlier, were not satisfied with the concession and wrote numerous letters asking for the original position to be restored. Among these was the letter of 20 October 1995 which was accompanied by a five page list of `Points` in which the plaintiffs set out all the arguments which they wished to put forward. However, no fresh facts were disclosed in that document. The plaintiffs then retained solicitors and requested a meeting. Mr Lee acceded to the request and met Mr Manjit Singh and Mr Samuel Chacko on 28 October 1995. He explained to them the reasons for the policy and Mr Singh asked for a ten-day grace period to go to Jakarta to explain matters to the Indonesian parties. Mr Lee`s evidence, which was unchallenged, was that he was prepared to support and to agree to this but that he had to check with PSA and GSB. If Mr Lee were indeed directing the actions of the committee as the plaintiffs contended, he would not have indicated the necessity of consulting the other two parties.
In fact, the evidence shows that after meeting Mr Manjit Singh, Mr Lee contacted Mr Soo of PSA and recommended that the ten-day extension be granted to the plaintiffs. Mr Soo accepted Mr Lee`s recommendation and PSA`s agreement to it is shown in the documents. The decision to grant the extension was not made unilaterally by Mr Lee or STPB. The extension was given with the express agreement of PSA upon recommendation by STPB.
The evidence also shows that after 12 October 1995 Mr Lee was not directing matters to deny the plaintiffs the opportunity to be heard. Instead, whenever the plaintiffs` requests for an opportunity to meet were turned down, those decisions were based on telephone calls between the committee members to decide if it was necessary to meet the plaintiffs. Mr Lee never signed any letter as chairman of the committee and although there is one letter where the author or person sending it is stated as `for Chairman, Cruise Review Committee`, that letter emanated from PSA and the drafter could not have considered Mr Lee as the chairman since the letter was copied to him.
The plaintiffs made something of the fact that they were told to write in to STPB if they had any representations for the committee`s consideration. PSA`s explanation for this, as given by Mrs Tan, was that letters were to be sent to STPB not because Mr Lee was in charge but because any evaluation of cruise products fell within the expertise of STPB. PSA considered its own expertise to lie more with the infrastructure of the cruise centre. STPB would evaluate the cruise product first and the committee would then consider the matter. I accept PSA`s explanation as the documentation shows that from very early on PSA had sought the advice and expertise of STPB in developing the cruise industry since STPB had the experience and contacts in tourist related businesses.
The plaintiffs made several requests in October 1995 for a meeting with the committee to put forward their position. The committee did not accept any of these requests. As far as requests made before 12 October were concerned, the view taken by the committee was that since the plaintiffs` representatives had already met PSA on 28 September 1995 and the committee had decided to meet on 12 October 1995 to discuss the plaintiffs` representations, there was no need for a meeting with the plaintiffs` representatives. After the decision of 12 October 1995, the committee decided not to meet the plaintiffs since they had not put forward any new points for consideration. The evidence before the court supports this conclusion. In deciding to increase the CNW quota to 50%, the committee had acted on the basis of the information provided by the plaintiffs that their contractual obligations committed them to the schedule already submitted (ie 66% CNW). There was nothing in the subsequent correspondence which significantly added to this information. The plaintiffs had no other reasons to support their request that the 30% guidelines should not be applied to them. When I asked Mr Purwadi what other reasons he had in mind at that time to persuade PSA to change its mind, he said he could not remember what other reasons he had had. If there had in fact been other reasons, it is inconceivable that Mr Purwadi could have forgotten them.
In these circumstances, the committee was not obliged to re-consider the same matters on several occasions especially since there were no fresh facts justifying all the consideration. See 
 R v Shropshire Health Authority & Ors, ex p Duffus 
 (
 The Times 
, 16 August 1989). This case makes it clear that an administrative authority is under no duty to consider the same matter on several occasions based on the same set of facts. To require repeated re-consideration would endanger the administrative process by rendering it unworkable and the body is only obliged to re-consider its decision if there is new or different material to support such a request.
By 6 November 1995, the ten-day extension had expired. The plaintiffs did not amend their schedule to comply with the 30% guideline. Neither did they nor their solicitors inform the defendants of the outcome of their meeting with the Indonesian parties. At that time Nautican`s next call here was scheduled for 11 November 1995.
On 6 November itself, PSA wrote to STPB informing the latter that no amended schedule had been submitted by the plaintiffs and asking for STPB`s concurrence to deny Nautican a berth for her CNW voyages from Saturday, 11 November onwards. The next morning, Mr Tan Hock Lye, a deputy director (commercial) of the PSA, to whom Mrs Tan reported, discussed the matter with her and made the decision to refuse permission for Nautican to use the cruise berths thereafter. Mr Liow of STPB spoke with Mrs Tan later that morning and was told of Mr Tan Hock Lye`s decision. Mrs Tan then told Mr Liow that since the plaintiffs had contacted STPB on the matter, it would be preferable for them to convey PSA`s decision to the plaintiffs. This resulted in STPB`s letter of 7 November to the plaintiffs` solicitors informing them that PSA would be denying berthing rights to Nautican on 11 November 1995. The letter asked the solicitors to `convey PSA`s decision` to the plaintiffs so that the necessary arrangements would be made. On 10 November PSA cancelled the berth applications of Nautican with effect from 11 November 1995.
Having considered the evidence, I am satisfied that the decision to deny Nautican a berth on 11 November 1995 was made by PSA itself. Whilst it had asked STPB for its concurrence in that decision, it did not act under STPB`s direction and made the decision on its own account based on the facts available to it as at that date. STPB itself recognised that it had not been the deciding body as the reference in its letter to `PSA`s decision` clearly indicates.
The effect of PSA`s decision was negated by the injunction which I granted. In compliance with that injunction order, Nautican was granted a berth on 11 November and thereafter until 4 December 1995 when I discharged the injunction. On 5 December 1995, PSA granted the plaintiffs a two-week grace period so as to give them some time to make appropriate arrangements following the discharge of the injunction. Nautican was allowed to maintain its berth applications as originally submitted for berths for CNW until 18 December 1995.
There is no evidence that STPB or the GSB were in any way involved in the granting of this grace period. Neither is there any evidence to suggest that either of these parties directed PSA to deny a berth to Nautican after 18 December. I was told in court, and I believe, that the committee stopped all their meetings in relation to CNWs following the injunction. Whilst the evidence also was that PSA officers continued to speak and to write to STPB and/or GSB thereafter, this does not mean that the decisions to grant the grace period and to thereafter deny the berth were decisions made by anyone other than PSA itself. In court, Mr Lee stated that STPB played no part in the granting of the two week grace period. He also confirmed that it was not involved in any of the subsequent decisions to refuse to allow Nautican to use the cruise berths thereafter. I accept his testimony.
Since 2 January 1996, the guidelines have, as far as PSA is concerned, been incorporated in the Singapore Cruise Centre Circular No. 1 of 1996. This recasts the guidelines in the manner set out in full in para 53 above. A comparison between the contents of the Circular and the original guidelines shows that condition (iv) has been dropped and that the Circular contains the express provision that no cruise vessel will be allowed any berth without the express written consent of PSA (para 1(b) of the Circular). Also under para 1(f), PSA states that it may revise the guidelines at any time if it deems appropriate and para 1(g) is a catch-all paragraph stating that the guidelines are without prejudice to PSA`s rights to refuse to provide berthing facilities to any cruise vessel for any other reason it deems appropriate.
The plaintiffs criticise the inclusion of para 1(b) on the basis that no equivalent power can be found in PSA Act or the Regulations. They say that by virtue of para 1(b), PSA has arrogated to itself a power which Parliament has not given it in the Act. Thus, para 1(b) is itself ultra vires and would affect the whole of the Circular. Also the effect of paras 1(f) and 1(g) is to say that PSA has additional powers which allows it to revise Circular No 1 of 1996 and which allows them to refuse berthing facilities for reasons which PSA in its sole and absolute discretion deems proper. The plaintiffs contend that this cannot be right as PSA does not have such power and the Circular cannot to allocate to PSA more powers than provided for under the PSA Act.
I do not accept the plaintiffs` criticisms of the Circular. In substance, PSA`s berthing policy as set out in the guidelines orally announced on 22 June 1995 has been reproduced in written form in the Circular. PSA has, however, taken the opportunity to rescind condition (iv) which, as I have pointed out, is not a valid provision since PSA cannot fetter its own discretion. In my judgment, para 1(b) of the Circular is simply declaratory of the power which PSA has under the PSA Act and the Regulations. As regards paras 1(f) and 1(g), these were necessitated by the fact that the guidelines had been reduced to writing and therefore had assumed a more rigid form. The two new paragraphs serve as reminders that the guidelines are subject to change and that PSA`s discretion cannot be restricted by the guidelines though, of course, if PSA was going to deny a berth for other reasons, it would have to be able to justify such denial if and when challenged.
In my judgment, the Circular cannot be attacked on the basis of ultra vires. Further, in view of the contents of the Circular, it is clear that as from 2 January 1996, decisions on the allocation and denial of berths to cruise ships were made by PSA itself and that even the spectre of control being exercised by either STPB or GSB had been completely dissipated. In fact, there is no evidence that after its issue the decision to continue denying Nautican a berth until it complied with the CNW limit was made by anyone other than PSA.
Was there a breach of natural justice by PSA and was Nautican treated unfairly?
The first allegation which the plaintiffs made in this connection was that the 30% restriction on CNWs was incapable of being accurately ascertained or verified and that its ambit, applicability, interpretation and enforcement was uncertain. This contention was not supported by the evidence. As stated earlier, the plaintiffs` own witnesses confirmed in court that after the meeting of 22 June 1995, they understood the terms of the 30% guideline and the restriction on berthing allocations for CNWs in excess of that limit and how these guidelines would affect the business of the plaintiffs. Further, prior to the filing of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs in their correspondence with the defendants did not express any uncertainty as to the terms of the guidelines or their extent and effect.
The second allegation in this connection is that the plaintiffs were denied the right to be heard. In this connection it is correct that the plaintiffs were never given the opportunity to appear personally before a meeting of the committee to present their case. The evidence as a whole, however, shows that the plaintiffs had, on separate occasions, meetings with both PSA and STPB personnel on the issue of the guidelines and also had telephone conversations with these officers on the same matter. Additionally, the plaintiffs submitted several letters on their position. They had many opportunities to make both written and oral representations to the defendants starting from the meeting of 22 June 1995 itself. The 4 July meeting at STPB was another such opportunity which Mr Purwadi could have exploited but did not. Then there was a meeting at the PSA on 28 September 1995 between the plaintiffs` representatives and PSA personnel. At these three meetings, however, no mention was made of the Indonesian contracts and why the CNW restriction should not be applied to the plaintiffs.
As I have stated earlier, there was no duty on the committee to accede to the plaintiffs` repeated requests for an opportunity to personally present their case before the committee since there was no evidence that at such a meeting anything new would be tendered and the committee had already considered the plaintiffs` arguments. There was in my view no denial of natural justice by reason of the committee`s refusal to entertain personal representations from the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs have also claimed in the statement of claim that PSA decided to deny berthing facilities to Nautican without regard to the merits of the plaintiffs` case and took into account irrelevant considerations when coming to that decision. They suggested that there was no direct evidence before the court that there were any illegal activities taking place on Nautican in Singapore and therefore it was not correct for PSA to apply the guidelines to their vessel. In closing, the plaintiffs asserted that the decision to deny berthing facilities was, in any event, so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have come to it.
The evidence shows, however, that the guidelines had been adopted by PSA as a general policy in order to guide itself in the exercise of its discretion in the allocation and denial of berthing facilities at the Singapore Cruise Centre. As the guidelines formed a general policy, PSA was entitled to apply them across the board to all cruise operators and cruise vessels. It was not necessary for PSA to satisfy itself that illegal activities were taking place on board Nautican before applying the CNW limit to that vessel. It was sufficient to justify PSA`s decision that Nautican`s schedule as proposed by the plaintiffs would have meant that more than 50% of its voyages from Singapore would have been CNWs. There was nothing unfair in PSA applying the guidelines to Nautican once all representations made had been given due consideration.
The plaintiffs suggested that there was no evidence before the court that the predominant activities on board Nautican were gambling or other undesirable activities and, given that PSA had stated that the main aim of the guidelines was to curb such undesirable activities on board cruise ships, it was wrong to apply the 30% CNW restriction to Nautican. The suggestion is not sustainable. Once the guidelines had been adopted on a rational basis, as they were, PSA was entitled to apply them across the board to CNWs carried out by all cruise ships and irrespective of whether in any particular case the cruise ship concerned did not operate a casino. That latter fact would only be relevant to the question whether an exception to the application of the 30% restriction should be made to the vessel concerned.
If the plaintiffs were contending that they should have been exempted entirely from the application of the restriction because they were not a gambling ship, then it was up to them to provide PSA with material and reasons to support this. The only factor which the plaintiffs relied on to support their request for more CNWs was their alleged contracts with the Indonesian parties. They did not contend, either directly to PSA or before me, that no gambling or hardly any gambling took place on board Nautican so that it would be unfair to restrict their CNWs. As the evidence suggests strongly that gambling was an important activity, if not the main activity, on board the vessel when it carried out a CNW, the plaintiffs were probably in no position to make such an argument.
The weekly sailing schedule of Nautican was as follows: 
(i) the vessel would leave Jakarta on Friday morning and arrive in Singapore on Saturday evening; 
(ii) on Saturday evening, it would leave on a CNW after dinner and return to Singapore on the following Sunday morning; 
(iii) it would leave on another CNW on Sunday evening and return to Singapore on the following Monday morning; 
(iv) it would leave for Jakarta on Monday morning and arrive in Jakarta late Tuesday morning.
This schedule makes it clear that all Nautican`s CNWs were overnight cruises. It is difficult to imagine what activity other than gambling could have attracted the passengers to a CNW cruise on Nautican when nearly the entire cruise took place at night. The passengers might possibly have been there to watch a movie, eat, or enjoy themselves in the karaoke lounge or disco but these were all activities which they could equally have enjoyed on shore without the nuisance of having to board a vessel with their passports and without paying any cabin charges. It appeared to me that the main attraction for such passengers had to be the gambling facilities on board which were not available in Singapore.
Further, as the evidence showed, more passengers boarded the vessel for a CNW than could be properly accommodated in Nautican`s cabins. The cabin allocation documents for the CNW voyage on 11 November 1995 shows that there were 27 passengers who were not allocated any cabins at all. Further, there were instances where more than three passengers were allocated to a single cabin and some cabins even had up to seven or eight passengers allocated to them. This was despite Mr Purwadi`s testimony that usually the cabins are only able to accommodate two persons and that he would be surprised if there were more than four or five passengers in a cabin.
Mr Purwadi`s initial explanation for the over-allocation of passengers to a cabin was that it was because those persons may have been members of the same family. The manifest belied his explanation. For example, cabin no. 231 had two Thai females, one Thai male, two Singaporean males and one Chinese female allocated to it. When this was pointed out, Mr Purwadi suggested that there had been a mistake by his counter staff as they sometimes allocated passengers to cabins there were already occupied. He explained that the cabin allocation would be sorted out once the passengers were on board. This explanation was not credible given that the manifest showed many similar mistakes which would have taken hours to rectify since there were more than 500 passengers on board that evening. There would be chaos if so many passengers needed their cabins sorted out after they boarded and, since the CNWs were overnight cruises, if the explanation were true it would mean that many passengers would be without cabins for a greater part of the CNW while waiting for the muddle to be resolved. It would appear that most of these passengers were not on board for the cruise experience but were there to gamble in the casino and therefore did not require a proper allocation of cabins.
From the revenue point of view also, Nautican appeared to be a vastly losing enterprise if revenue from gambling was factored out entirely. The evidence is that, on average, the number of passengers from Jakarta was about 200. The number returning there on Monday was about 100-170 and the number of passengers on a CNW would be about 400 on a Saturday and less than 300 on Sunday. Using the figures for cabin sales given in the Indonesian contracts, it would appear that the revenue from the passengers travelling from Jakarta to Singapore and back would be about $65,000 a week whilst the revenue from passengers embarking on CNWs would be about $61,250 per week. As such, total weekly revenue from cruise fares would be about $130,000. On the other hand, the vessel`s daily operating expense was $80,000 which made the plaintiffs` weekly operating expenses at least $560,000.
The above figures mean that the plaintiffs needed to make over $400,000 a week simply to break even. When asked whether the plaintiffs made that amount of money from their one mid-week trip to Semarang, Surabaya or Bali, Mr Purwadi said he was not sure. In any event, since the plaintiffs needed three trips over the weekends to make $130,000 from passenger fares, it would have been impossible for them to have made $400,000 from one mid-week voyage. The necessary inference is that the plaintiffs must have had alternative sources of revenue to support their operations. Mr Purwadi told me that the plaintiffs earned income from the other activities on board like the karaoke rooms, beauty salon, the bar, food, night-club and the cinema. It appears highly unlikely to me that these activities could have generated $400,000 a week. In any event, making that amount would have only allowed the plaintiffs to break even on their operating costs for the vessel. To make profits, they would have to generate even greater revenue. It appears highly probable that since the plaintiffs were able to continue in operation for more than a year after chartering Nautican, it must have been because Nautican had substantial revenue from gambling. Even a paid up capital of $6 million would not have been able to sustain the plaintiffs for long if they were making losses of around $400,000 a week.
In all the circumstances, the plaintiffs are not able to substantiate their contention that the decision to deny Nautican further berthing rights after it exhausted its CNW quota was so unreasonable that no reasonable authority would have come to it. Neither have they established any of the other administrative law grounds which they raised. I now turn to their other heads of claim.
 Claims arising in tort
In their statement of claim, the plaintiffs raised four claims in tort. In their closing submissions, however, they relied principally on the tort of misfeasance in a public office. I will therefore deal with it first. As explained in Judicial Remedies in Public Law by Clive Lewis (Ch 14 pp 59-64) the essence of this tort is an act done by a public officer or public body where: 
(i) the act is done maliciously or with the knowledge that it is ultra vires the powers of the public body; 
(ii) it is foreseeable that the act would cause damage to the plaintiffs; and 
(iii) the act actually does cause damage to the plaintiffs.
The act complained of in this case is the act of denying Nautican a berth for its CNW cruises from 11 November 1995. As regards the first ingredient, in his submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs expressly stated that the plaintiffs were not relying on malice. Instead, he emphasised that this ingredient was made out because the defendants knew that their actions were ultra vires. In view of my finding that the defendants were not acting ultra vires in formulating the guidelines or in enforcing them once so formulated, the plaintiffs cannot make out this ingredient. The plaintiffs also have difficulty with the third ingredient which is that damage was caused by the denial of the berth.
The plaintiffs did not plead nor adduce any evidence of the actual financial damage which they had sustained or would probably sustain by reason of the defendants` actions. Up to the time of trial, no letters of demand had been received, no action had been commenced against them and Mr Purwadi could not confirm that he was being sued for breaching his contract with the Indonesian parties. No document was produced relating to the financial particulars of their loss. There was nothing before me to help me assess the financial impact of the denial of the berth on the plaintiffs` operations.
The plaintiffs` main plank in relation to damages was the existence of the contracts with the Indonesian parties. However, they did not discharge the onus of proving that these Indonesian contracts had the contractual force which they alleged. Whilst the documents appeared to show that the plaintiffs had agreed to sell a certain number of cabins in the vessel to the Indonesian parties, no evidence was provided by the plaintiffs that the Indonesian parties had actually purchased these cabins in advance for the duration of the alleged contracts or had on sold them to actual passengers so as to render the plaintiffs liable in damages once they were unable to supply the cabins because of the imposition of the 30% restriction. Further, the conduct of the Indonesian parties after the discharge of the injunction was not consistent with their having an enforceable claim for damages against the plaintiffs: 
(i) no correspondence whatsoever appears to have been exchanged with the Indonesian parties after the discharge of the injunction; 
(ii) no correspondence whatsoever was, at any time, received from the Indonesian parties providing details of their alleged claims against the plaintiffs; 
(iii) no action was started; 
(iv) according to Mr Purwadi, following the strict implementation of the 30% restriction, the Indonesian contracts were terminated but no document or correspondence was exchanged with the Indonesians on the alleged termination of the contracts and this despite the fact that the Indonesians were represented by lawyers.
The plaintiffs` answer to the points made by the defendants on damages was that it was not necessary for them to prove damages at the trial but that if their claim was found to be substantiated then I could make an order for damages to be assessed by the Registrar. I cannot accept this argument in relation to the tort of misfeasance since proof of actual damage is an essential ingredient of the tort. This is in addition to proving that it is foreseeable that damages will be sustained by reason of the tortious act. As the plaintiffs have not made out an essential plank of this cause of action, it must fail.
The more substantial tort pleaded by the plaintiffs was that the defendants wrongfully interfered with their contractual relationships. In relation to PSA, the allegation was that it had compelled the plaintiffs to breach their two contracts with the Indonesian parties which required them to supply two CNWs per weekend by insisting that they amend Nautican`s sailing schedules so that it undertook only one CNW per week for the period October to December 1995. In relation to STPB, the allegation was that it had wrongfully compelled or attempted to compel the plaintiffs to breach the same Indonesian contracts or had prevented the plaintiffs from performing the contracts. Although the plaintiffs did not develop these allegations substantially in their submissions, I think that I should deal with them.
The essence of the tort of inducing a breach of contract is that 
 A 
 knowingly and by unlawful means induces 
 B 
 who has a contract with 
 C 
 to commit a breach of that contract or hinders the performance of that contract so that 
 C 
 suffers damage; in such a case, 
 A 
 has committed a wrong and is liable to 
 C 
 unless the inducement is justified: see 45 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) paras 1518, 1525. In this case, 
 A 
 would be PSA/STPB while 
 B 
 would be the plaintiffs and 
 C 
 would be the Indonesian parties. Thus, the plaintiffs` action against the defendants for inducing breach of contract with their Indonesian parties is clearly misconceived because the right is vested in the innocent party 
 C 
 and not in the person of 
 B 
 who is the party breaching the contract. Further, the plaintiffs have not proved that either defendant knew at the time that the guidelines were formulated that the Indonesian contracts existed. On the contrary, the evidence establishes that the defendants were only made aware of these contracts in September 1995 well after the guidelines were introduced. Also, the plaintiffs themselves acted recklessly in that from their own evidence they knew in late 1994 that PSA wanted CNWs restricted to 30% of a cruise vessel`s voyages and yet they still entered into contracts which would violate the restriction. They can hardly accuse the defendants of inducing them to breach contracts which they should not have made in the first place since they knew of the probability of action being taken by PSA which would prevent them from carrying out the terms of the contracts.
In relation to STPB, there is a further allegation of inducement of breach of contract. This is in respect of the alleged contract for berthing facilities between PSA and the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs` assertion in their statement of claim is that STPB wrongfully induced or procured PSA to breach this contract. This claim cannot succeed. Quite apart with the difficulties that the plaintiffs have in substantiating their contention of a contractual relationship with PSA (which is dealt with later in this judgment), my finding above was that STPB did not make the decision that the plaintiffs should be denied a berth. This decision was made by PSA and the fact that it had STPB`s concurrence in the decision does not change the reality that PSA was the deciding body. Accordingly, the plaintiffs cannot substantiate the allegation of inducement or procurement by STPB.
A connected allegation in the statement of claim was that STPB had threatened and intended, unless restrained, to continue to procure or induce breaches of contracts of the plaintiffs. This ground was not developed in submissions probably because there was no evidence to support it. Neither did the plaintiffs develop their pleaded assertions of an unlawful interference with their trade or business. Therefore, it is not necessary to deal with either of these claims here.
 Is PSA under a contractual obligation to provide berthing facilities to Nautican? 
The plaintiffs rely on three documents to evidence the contractual arrangements between themselves and PSA whereby they contend that PSA is obliged to provide a berth for Nautican as and when requested by the plaintiffs subject only to the physical availability of such berth. The first is an `Application for opening an account with Port of Singapore Authority` which the plaintiffs submitted to PSA in November 1990. In this application form, the plaintiffs indicated that berthing/unberthing facilities were among the categories of services provided by PSA that they wished to utilise. The second document is PSA`s letter dated 10 November 1990 to the plaintiffs whereby they accepted the application for an account and asked the plaintiffs to submit a letter of guarantee in the form enclosed. Thirdly, there was correspondence in October 1995 in connection with an amended letter of guarantee which PSA required the plaintiffs to furnish.
The plaintiffs` submission is that when commercial parties come together and funds are released and taken, the ordinary presumption is that the parties have entered into a contract. Monies would not be placed with PSA unless the parties had agreed to the basis on which the funds were placed, the basis on which the funds were to be deducted by PSA and the basis on which additional funds are to be furnished when required. The documents referred to in para 144 (`the said documents`) do not provide anywhere that PSA has a right to deny a berth. Further, the said documents must be read with PSA`s indications prior to June 1995 by way of circulars to cruise operators that allocation of berths was on a first-come-first-served basis and that therefore berthing schedules should be submitted a year in advance. These formed contractual arrangements whereby PSA was obliged to allocate berths only in accordance to the first-come-first-served policy and was not entitled to refuse berths on the basis of excessive CNWs.
I find it difficult to translate the account and payment arrangements as evidenced by the said documents into a contract whereby PSA is obliged to provide berthing facilities to Nautican whenever required by the plaintiffs. First, it is clear that the account was opened and operated for the sole purpose of facilitating settlement of accounts between the plaintiffs and PSA in respect of PSA`s charges for its port services provided to vessels at the plaintiffs` requests. Such accounts, as Mrs Tan confirmed, are opened by all port agents operating in Singapore for all types of vessels which call at Singapore.
Secondly, there is nothing in any of the said documents which relates specifically to the manner in which berths are to be provided whether on a first-come-first-served basis or at all. The said documents do not refer to the terms on which any of PSA`s port services are to be provided to the plaintiffs` vessels. Such terms as are incorporated in the said documents relate purely to financial arrangements for the payment of such services as are in fact provided by PSA upon the plaintiffs` request. It is therefore difficult to extract from the said documents any contractual obligation on PSA to provide berthing facilities to Nautican.
Mr Purwadi himself was somewhat diffident on this aspect. In one of his affidavits, after referring to the account and the bank guarantee provided, he suggested that there was a `contractual relationship` between the plaintiffs and PSA. However, he did not go on to assert that PSA was under a contractual obligation to provide berthing facilities to Nautican. In any event, cl 9 of the terms and conditions which were attached to the application for an account with PSA provide that `the opening of the account shall not in any way abrogate or prejudice any of the powers conferred on the PSA by the Port of Singapore Authority Act or by any statute, bye-laws or regulations`. Accordingly, even if there was a contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and PSA constituted by the existence of the account, such relationship does not impose any obligation on PSA to provide berthing facilities to Nautican since under the Schedule and the Regulations, PSA has the power to refuse permission for Nautican to use the berths.
Although prior to June 1995, PSA allocated berthing facilities to Nautican on a first-come-first-served basis in accordance with her sailing schedule, such conduct does not in my view create a contract requiring PSA to provide berthing facilities to Nautican on that basis ad infinitum and without regard to other relevant factors. It is clear from reg 36 that PSA has the discretion to decide (i) whether to grant or refuse permission to any cruise vessel to use its berths and, (ii) having decided to give permission to any particular vessel to berth, how to allocate a berth to that vessel. PSA`s general policy, as stated in para 6 of the Singapore Cruise Centre Circulars issued in 1993, 1994 and 1995, is that `allocation of berths is on a first-come-first-served basis`. This general policy is obviously for the purpose of guiding PSA in the exercise of its discretion on how to allocate berths among those vessels which have been given permission to berth and does not mean that willy-nilly PSA has to provide a berth to any vessel that requests one regardless of any other relevant consideration. It is notable that even this general policy is subject to exceptions, for example, when a cruise vessel is on a maiden call or when ship inspections have been carried out.
I agree therefore with the submission of PSA that it is incorrect for the plaintiffs to suggest that application of PSA`s general policy of allocating berths to Nautican on previous occasions on a first-come-first-served basis when at that time Nautican fell within the class of vessels entitled to berth, gave rise to a contractual obligation on PSA to provide berthing facilities to Nautican. The evidence was that in cases where PSA had agreed to be bound by a contractual obligation to provide berths to vessels, it had entered into express agreements to give effect to this obligation and to regulate the terms of the obligation. In fact in 1995 PSA had drawn up a standard form agreement entitled `Terminal Service Agreement` for this purpose. No such tailor-made contract existed in this case and, in my view, the plaintiffs` attempt to convert the said documents into such a contract by cobbling them together with a general berthing policy was misguided and completely beyond the express (and even implied) bounds of the said documents.
 Conclusion
In the result, the plaintiffs have been unable to establish their case under any of the heads which they have advanced. Accordingly, I dismiss the plaintiffs` claim as against each of the defendants with costs.

The plaintiff is the Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore. He has been Prime Minister of Singapore since November 1990. He is the Secretary-General of the People`s Action Party (PAP) and has been Secretary-General since December 1992. He has also been a member of Parliament since 1976. The defendant is an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore. He is a member of the Worker`s Party and was one of the candidates for election in the parliamentary constituency of Cheng San GRC for the Parliamentary General Elections held on 2 January 1997.
The plaintiff`s claims is for damages (including aggravated damages) for the slander uttered on 10 January 1997 by the defendant of the plaintiff in the course of the defendant`s telephone conversation in Malaysia with one Mr Brendan Pereira, a journalist with 
 The Straits Times 
. The plaintiff further claims damages (including aggravated damages) for the libel committed by the defendant and contained in an article entitled `I fled as I feared being arrested: Tang` which was published in the 11 January 1997 issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 and any re-publication thereof. The plaintiff filed the writ of summons on 31 January 1997. On 5 February 1997 the defendant`s solicitors, Messrs Tang & Co, entered appearance for him.
On 19 February 1997 the plaintiff filed his statement of claim. On 4 March 1997 the defendant filed his defence. I will have to revert to both documents in great depth later in the course of this judgment.
For the moment, it should be noted that the defendant by his defence admitted having uttered the words and accepted responsibility for the publication of the words in 
 The Straits Times 
 which the plaintiff complained constituted respectively the serious torts of slander and libel of him. In other words, the accuracy of the words spoken by the defendant to the reporter and its reporting in 
 The Straits Times 
 on 11 January 1997 has been and is accepted unreservedly by the defendant.
However, the defendant in his defence asserted three defences and made one allegation. I will in this introductory part of the judgment, first of all, set out briefly the allegation and the three defences. I will deal with them at length later in my judgment.
By para 1 and at the forefront of his defence, the defendant `contends` that this suit, along with Suit Nos 2523/96, 2524/96 and 2525/96 and Suit Nos 70/97, 76/97, 82/97, 172/97, 181/97, 182/97, 187/97 and 188/97, is an abuse of the process of court and should be struck out or stayed. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff and the plaintiffs in the other suits mentioned were invoking the law of defamation for `the ulterior and improper motive of achieving political advantage and for the collateral purpose of driving the defendant from the political arena for fear of the huge potential awards of damages and costs`.
I now refer briefly to the three defences. First, by para 3 of his defence he says `the words complained of do not refer to the plaintiff.` This means that I have to refer to and consider the factual matrix as set out in the statement of claim and the admissions expressly made by the defendant in his defence. Under the Rules of Court, this court is not to take into account any affidavit evidence. Of course, the court may draw reasonable inferences from the admissions made by the defendant. On that basis, and that basis alone, I will have to decide if the defendant`s words refer to the plaintiff.
Secondly, the defendant says that his words were not defamatory and did not bear the defamatory meaning as alleged by the plaintiff. This defence entails the determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the words as uttered and as published. That is always a question of fact which has to be determined by a judge. I will, later in this judgment, set out the relevant law. Suffice it to note for the moment that extrinsic evidence is not admissible in construing the words. For that matter, what the defendant intended to mean in that conversation and the subsequent publication in 
 The Straits Times 
 or the sense in which Mr Brendan Pereira or the plaintiff respectively understood the conversation and the publication is irrelevant and inadmissible in evidence. It is a basic principle of the law of defamation that the meaning must be gathered from the words used by the defendant and none other, and in the context of the entire conversation made by the defendant. A judge as a finder of fact has to ascertain the single and the right meaning of the words or publication complained of.
The third defence appeared in an unexpected part of the defence. Paragraph 17 of the defence denied that the plaintiff was entitled to aggravated damages by reason of the multitude of particulars set out in para 41 of the statement of claim, which is itself sub-divided into ten sub-paragraphs and has taken 17 pages of the pleadings to set out. There then followed the last sentence of para 17 of the defence in these terms: `It is averred that the plaintiff`s failure to plead that the action for slander is actionable under the law of Malaysia results in the statement of claim disclosing no cause of action.` I did not have the benefit of submissions from counsel of both parties on this point. I therefore invited them to tender submissions on the issues raised by this sentence. Both counsel have done so. I will deal with the matters raised in the last part of this judgment.
On 7 March 1997 the plaintiff applied by Summons in Chambers No 1669/97 under O 18 r 19(1)(a) of the Rules of Court for an order that the defence be struck out and that the plaintiff be at liberty to enter judgment against the defendant for damages to be assessed and costs. The application came up for hearing on 11 March 1997. Mr JB Jeyaretnam, who was acting for the defendant in several other actions, was in court. But he told the court that he had no instructions to appear to oppose the application. Counsel for the plaintiff made his submissions. As I wanted time to consider the application, I directed counsel for the plaintiff to file his written submissions by Friday, 14 March 1997 which counsel did. I directed counsel to submit what the plaintiff would contend was the single and the right meaning conveyed to the reasonable listener and the reasonable reader in respect of the slander and libel. The plaintiff`s written submissions were duly filed.
However, on 4 April 1996 Messrs Peter Low, Tang & Partners wrote to the Registrar of the Supreme Court and stated that the firm had just taken over the matter. It appeared to them that at the hearing on 11 March 1997 Mr JB Jeyaretnam had told the court that he had not been instructed to appear. Noting that the plaintiff`s solicitors had tendered written submissions, they asked whether I was prepared to allow them to tender written submissions in opposition to the plaintiff`s application within seven days. I immediately acceded to their request. The defendant`s solicitors tendered the written submissions on 11 April 1997.
 The law and practice of striking out
The plaintiff`s application to strike out the whole of the defence is made under O 18 r 19 and the relevant portion reads as follows: 
 
 
(1) The court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that - 
 
(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be; 
 
and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be. 
 
(2) No evidence shall be admissible on an application under para (1)(a).
  
 
 
The consequence of striking out a defence on the ground that it discloses no reasonable defence is that judgment will be entered against the defendant without a trial. Similarly, a claim which discloses no reasonable cause of action will be dismissed without a trial of the claim. It is therefore a summary power. In the appropriate case, the decision to strike out a claim or a defence has the salutary effect of obviating what would be an unnecessary and wasteful trial. But the summary power can only be exercised according to established principles. It has long been established that striking out the whole of a defence is only allowed in a 
 plain and obvious case

In the case of 
 Bank of China 
 (supra), the defendant published a statement in its 18 June 1989 edition which the plaintiff asserted was libellous; the plaintiff set out six different meanings in para 5 of their statement of claim. By paras 2 and 4 of their defence, the defendant denied that the words were libellous or that they bore or were understood to bear any meaning defamatory of the plaintiff. The plaintiff applied to strike out the defence. This was described as `a bold step` by LP Thean J (as he then was). Nonetheless the learned judge proceeded to consider the pleadings, and only the pleadings, and came to the `irresistible` conclusion that the published statement in effect, as found by the learned judge, was libellous of the plaintiff. The learned judge stated at p 508: `The plaintiff in para 5 of the statement of claim ascribed to the words no less than six meanings cumulatively I do not think that to ordinary reasonable persons the words would convey such a comprehensive range of meanings. In my judgment, they would convey some of the meanings ascribed to them by the plaintiff. In particular, they would convey the meaning that the plaintiff`s branch in Singapore after a total withdrawal of US$75m by its depositors had no funds or financial resources to meet further withdrawal by its depositors and had become temporarily insolvent.` One`rsquo;s reading of this passage in the light of the entire judgment does not assist in eliciting what precisely was the single and the right meaning that the learned judge had in mind; it is, however, helpful that he had set out the essence of the sting of the libel.
Accordingly, my task is to examine the pleadings closely and see if the plaintiff has made out a plain and obvious case that all the defences are in substance and in law no reasonable defences at all in each and every plea. I begin by reciting the undisputed factual background as set out in the statement of claim and expressly admitted in the defence. Next, I will consider and identify the natural and ordinary meaning of the words that the plaintiff alleges to be slanderous against him (the offending words) and the words in the article in 
 The Straits Times 
. Then I will ascertain if the single and right meaning is defamatory of and if they refer to the plaintiff at all. Lastly, I will deal with the defendant`s contention that no reasonable cause of action has been disclosed in the statement of claim because of the plaintiff`s alleged failure to plead that under Malaysian laws the slander and the libel were actionable.
 The undisputed facts
The plaintiff`s claim, as briefly stated earlier, is for damages for slander and libel. The offending words are set out in para 31 of the statement of claim. They were uttered on 10 January 1997 in the course of a telephone interview in Malaysia conducted by one Mr Brendan Pereira, a journalist with 
 The Straits Times 
, with the defendant. The offending words were subsequently published in an article in the 11 January 1997 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
 entitled `I fled as I feared being arrested: Tang` (the article). The relevant portions of the article are set out in para 34 of the statement of claim. The plaintiff`s claim for libel is based on the article. The defendant in his defence accepted responsibility for the publication of the article in Singapore.
Unless otherwise stated, the facts which I will set out below are not in dispute and in fact admitted on the face of the defence. The narrative will be taken largely from the texts of the pleadings.

 Lianhe Wanbao 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
The defendant`s solicitors, Messrs Tang & Co, sent a letter dated 28 December 1996, to the plaintiff. The letter was in the following terms: 
(1) the letter stated that the following articles, namely, an article entitled `Serious men vs opportunists` in the 27 December 1996 issue of , an article entitled `Be wary of Tang`s words, says PM` in the 26 December 1996 issue of the newpaper, an article entitled in the 26 December 1996 issue of the and an article entitled in the 26 December 1996 issue of the , had reported that the plaintiff, in the course of campaigning for the PAP, had said that: 
(a) the defendant is a Chinese chauvinist who held radical views on the promotion of the Chinese language and culture and that these views would undermine Singapore`s racial peace; and 
(b) that the defendant entered politics as he wanted to settle personal scores with the Senior Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew (the Senior Minister) and Brigadier General Lee Hsien Loong, who had sued him for defamation and that the only thing in common between the defendant and his campaign partner, Mr Jeyaretnam, was that both had been sued by the Senior Minister and that the defendant`s intention in contesting in the General Elections was not for the purpose of serving the electorate. 
 
The letter went on to state that:
 
 
 
By the aforesaid statements, [the plaintiff] had thereby made the unfounded allegation that [the defendant] was an extremist with a dangerous character and not suitable to be a member of Parliament. [The defendant] notes that [the plaintiff] deliberately made these defamatory allegations and statements at the crucial moment of the current General Elections with the clear intention to defame [the defendant`s] character, thereby diminishing his chance of success in his contest in the General Elections.
 
 
 
Another letter dated 28 December 1996, in somewhat similar terms, was also sent to the Senior Minister.
On or about 28 December 1996, at a Workers` Party rally held at Yio Chu Kang Stadium, the defendant made a speech, during which he said, inter alia, the following: 
 
Merdeka! Merdeka! Merdeka! They say that I am a chauvinist. Well, they have to prove that. I apologise for coming late because I was rushing out two letters one to PM Goh and the other to Mr Lee Kuan Yew, asking them to withdraw their statement; otherwise I will sue them for defamation. I want them to withdraw their statement because their aim is to destroy my reputation and character. They want Christians to be afraid of me.
 
 
 
A report of the defendant`s speech appeared on the front page of the 29 December 1996 edition of 
 The Sunday Times 
 under the heading `Tang threatens to sue PM, SM.`
The plaintiff, through his solicitors, Messrs Allen & Gledhill, replied to Messrs Tang & Co`s letter on 29 December 1996. The plaintiff`rsquo;s solicitors` letter was in the following terms: 
 
 
1 [Messrs Allen & Gledhill] act for [the plaintiff]. [Messrs Tang & Co`s] letter dated 28 December 1996 to the plaintiff has been handed over to [Messrs Allen & Gledhill] with instructions to reply. [Messrs Tang & Co`s] letter appears to have been written by [the defendant], a partner in [Messrs Tang & Co]. 
 
2 The plaintiff is pleased to note that [the defendant] accepts that: 
 
(1) being called `a Chinese chauvinist who held radical and views on the promotion of the Chinese language culture and that these views would undermine Singapore`s racial peace` is defamatory; and 
 
(2) the statement that `[the defendant] entered politics as [the defendant] wanted to settle personal scores with [Mr] Lee Kuan Yew and [BG] Lee Hsien Loong, who had sued [the defendant] for defamation and that the only thing in common between [the defendant] and [the defendant`s] campaign partner, Mr Jeyaretnam was that both had been sued by Mr Lee Kuan Yew and that [the defendant`s] intention in contesting in the General Elections was not for the purpose of serving the electorate` is also defamatory. 
 
3 [The plaintiff] notes that [the defendant] knows and accepts that such a person is properly to be feared as a danger to stability in a multi-racial, multi-lingual, multi-religious society. It is also clear that [the defendant] realises that such a person is unsuitable to be a member of Parliament in Singapore. As [the defendant] said at an election rally on 28 December 1996 at Yio Chu Kang Stadium the statements, would destroy [the defendant`s] reputation and character. 
 
4 [The plaintiff stands by everything that he has said. [The plaintiff] will continue to repeat the statements that [the plaintiff] has made. [The plaintiff`s] statements are correct in fact where they are facts and are fair comment where they are comment. [The plaintiff`s] statements are based on the evidence of Minister Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean and former MPs Ker Sin Tze, Ow Chin Hock, Ch`ng Jit Koon and Chin Harn Tong. That evidence has been widely published and is unchallengeable. [Messrs Allen & Gledhill] note that [the defendant] has neither challenged the evidence, nor threatened to sue Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean, or any of the other four MPs. In fact, [Messrs Allen & Gledhill] note that [the defendant] has accepted the truth of what Rear Adm Teo has said. There are also other clear evidence of [the defendant`s] conduct which [the plaintiff] will rely upon, for the statements that [the plaintiff] has made, and will continue to make. The factual basis on which [the plaintiff`s] statements were made is therefore unchallengeable. 
 
5 Accordingly, [the defendant`s] demands, as set out in [Messrs Tang & Co`rsquo;s] letter of 28 December 1996 are categorically rejected. 
 
6 [The plaintiff] takes the view that [the defendant`s] threat to sue is simply an attempt to stifle discussion and avoid answering questions on the issue. [The plaintiff notes that [the defendant] has already used the excuse of impending legal action to avoid answering questions to 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
, as appears from today`s 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
. 
 
7 [The plaintiff] cannot see how the threat of an impending legal action can possibly be used as an excuse by [the defendant] to prevent legitimate discussion on [the defendant`s] suitability to be a member of Parliament and [the defendant`s] views on race and culture. [The defendant], as a lawyer, ought to know that such an excuse is baseless. 
 
8 [The plaintiff] intends to expose [the defendant`s] tactic for what it really is. Accordingly, [the plaintiff] invites [the defendant] to immediately commence proceedings against [the plaintiff]. [Messrs Allen & Gledhill have instructions to accept service of process. If [the defendant] really believes that he has a case, then [the plaintiff] invites [the defendant] to apply immediately for an interim injunction to prevent [the plaintiff] from repeating the same or similar statements. [Messrs Allen & Gledhill] are ready to attend court at short notice to argue any such application. [Messrs Allen & Gledhill] require prior notice to be given of any such application; and that [Messrs Tang & Co] show the court a copy of this letter, in any application made by [Messrs Tang & Co]. 
 
9 For the avoidance of doubt, please note that [the plaintiff] will be publishing this letter.
  
 
 
A letter making similar points was sent to the defendant`s solicitors, by the solicitors for the Senior Minister, on 29 December 1996.
The contents of the four letters were given wide publicity in the media. They were published, inter alia, in the 30 December 1996 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
 and the 30 December 1996 edition of 
 The Business Times 
.
The plaintiff in making the statements about the defendant had relied, inter alia, on the statements that had been made by the Senior Minister, Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean and Messrs Ker Sin Tze, Ow Chin Hock, Ch`ng Jit Koon and Chin Harn Tong. The said statements are set out at annex 1 to the statement of claim. The effect of the said statements was that the defendant was anti-Christian and a Chinese chauvinist with extreme views.
The statements of Messrs Ker Sin Tze, Ow Chin Hock, Ch`ng Jit Koon and Chin Harn Tong were widely reported and published, inter alia, in the 27 December 1996 edition of 
 The Business Times 
, the 29 December 1996 edition of 
 The Sunday Times 
 and the 30 December 1996 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
.
On or about 28 December 1996, the plaintiff released letters written in 1992 by Messrs Ker Sin Tze, Ow Chin Hock, Ch`ng Jit Koon, Chin Harn Tong and Tay Eng Soon, concerning the defendant`s character, in particular, the defendant`s views on Chinese culture. The fact of the release of the letters and extracts of the said letters were published in the 29 December 1996 edition of 
 The Sunday Times 
 and other media.
The statements of Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean were published, inter alia, in the 27 December 1996 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
 under the headings `Two WP men want your vote to pursue own interests: Rear Adm Teo` and `WP`s Tang Liang Hong a dangerous character, says PM`. An article was also published in the 30 December 1996 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
 (at p 1) entitled `PM Goh: I`m ready to go to court`.
Mr Seng Han Thong, a PAP MP elect, at an election rally held at the UOB Plaza on 30 December 1996, said that the defendant had told him that more Chinese educated people were needed in Parliament and that there were too many Christians in the Cabinet. Mr Seng Han Thong`s speech at the said rally was reported, inter alia, in an article published in the 31 December 1996 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
 entitled, `What Tang told me`: 
* More Chinese-educated needed in Parliament; 
* Too many Christians in Cabinet.
On or about 30 December 1996, the defendant, in the course of an interview with one Ahmad Osman (a journalist of 
 The Straits Times 
), responded to the plaintiff`s and the Senior Minister`s solicitors` letters of 29 December 1996 referred to above as well as the statements which had been made by Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean and Messrs Ker Sin Tze, Ow Chin Hock, Ch`ng Jit Koon, Chin Harn Tong and Seng Han Thong. One Mr Leong Mun Kwai was also present at the said interview. In the course of so responding, the defendant spoke (in the presence and/or hearing of Ahmad Osman and Mr Leong Mun Kwai) the following words which were and are defamatory of the plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as the defamatory statements): 
 
I am not going to court because it is wasting my time.
 
 
 
We are so short of time and we have such a huge constituency to cover. They are trying all sorts of things to make us busy.
 
 
 
 
 Of course, I am going to sue them. Not only that. I am going to lodge a police report against them for criminal offence. They are telling lies. They are defaming, assassinating my character. They concocted lies and go on television and spread the lies.
 I am not going to do it now. I have no time. What is the hurry? No need to hurry.
 
 
 
They are resorting to this `below-the-belt` hitting tactic. What character are they talking about?
 
 
 
Are they applying the same standards to themselves? Are they applying these standards?
 
 
 
Don`t forget. You say everybody`rsquo;s character can be put under public scrutiny.
 
 
 
Are you sure? Are we talking about the same standards? Are we proposing to adopt the same standards? Every people`s candidate, whether elected or before election, should be under public scrutiny. Are we talking about the same thing with the same standard?
 
 
 
You think I have time to prepare letters of demand against these people? All these will be after the election.
 
 
 
I do not want to be bogged down by all these things. They are trying to hurl all these things at me at the same time.
 
 
 
It is definitely damaging my election chances. That is their intention. I have faith in the decency of Singapore voters. Will they be taken in? [Emphassis added.]
 
 
 
The defendant admits to the matters stated in the preceding paragraph but avers that the words complained of do not refer to the plaintiff.
The contents of the defendant`s interview, including the defamatory statements, were published in an article entitled: `I will sue, but not now as I have no time, says Tang` in the 31 December 1996 issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 at p 18.
 The Business Times 
 Business Times 
The contents of defendant`s interview or the gist thereof were republished: 
(1) on the Internet under the `Asia One` website; and 
(2) in an article published in the 31 December 1996 edition of entitled `Tang won`t seek injunction - for now`. The following extracts were published in the said article: 
 
 
 Not only that, I am going to lodge a police report against them for criminal offence. They are telling lies. They are defaming, assassinating my character. They concocted lies and go on television and spread the lies
. I am not going to do it now. I have no time. What is the hurry? No need to hurry.
 
 
 
It is definitely damaging my election chances. That is their intention. Will they be taken in? Don`t forget many people may not have come to the rallies.
 
 
 
Ask them to come to listen to me, the Christians. Ask the Malays to come to listen to me, whether I am a chauvinist. Ask the English-educated whether I am anti English-educated.
 
 
 
All these years, what I was asking is: give an opportunity, if not equal, at least give some opportunity to those non-English speakers, the Malays, Chinese and Indians. They are in the majority.
 
 
 
When I say non-English-speaking majority, they include Indians, Malays and Chinese. I am not talking about the Chinese alone. I have been absolutely clear in my theme. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
At an election rally held at the Hougang Stadium on 31 December 1996, the defendant made, inter alia, the following statements: 
 
Is standing for elections the same as committing murder? No! I just want to contribute different ideas, ideas different from the PAP`s. They used the national mechanisms, (sic) against me. The pressures are so great that I almost broke down. Is it necessary?
 
 
 
Secondly, they are worried that we will question them about their policies in Parliament. Opposition in Parliament is important because without our presence, they cannot but table their plans for discussions. In the past, they passed everything, like the GST Bill, without a hitch due to the absence of a strong opposition. We have raised a lot of issues. We will also be raising the HPL issue. This is their death blow. Because of this, they are anxious and nervous. So, they have fabricated a lot of rumours of my being a chauvinist and against a certain religion. They are in control of the newspapers and television and can therefore repeat these lies a hundred times. Repeated often enough, lies will become truth.
 
 
 
The defendant`s statements and/or part thereof were published in, inter-alia, an article in the 1 January 1997 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
 at p 26 entitled `Singaporeans want more opposition MPs: Tang`.
At another rally held at Hougang Avenue 7 on 31 December 1996, the defendant stated, inter alia, that: 
 
My name has again dominated this evening papers. The whole page is covered with my name. Lee Yock Suan is finished in Cheng San. The PM has stepped in, so has SM Lee and the two DPMs, Lee Hsien Loong and Tony Tan. So, now they have eight (sic) men instead of five in the PAP team. All of them have joined in to attack me.
 
 
 
They say I am a racist, anti-Christian, anti-Islam. This is not true. There are many Malays and Christians here. The PAP is playing with fire. Why? Because they want to scare the Malays, Indians and Christians into opposing the WP. This is very dangerous. Now the Malays know that I am not a racist. If I were a racist, I would not have learnt the Malay language and the Malay and Indian dances.
 
 
 
They lied that I was a chauvinist and anti-Christian in order to stop me from entering Parliament. This is not a haphazard strategy but a calculated one. You must understand why they want to take this risk to play the game. In this constituency, there are about 10% Malay and Indian friends and more than 20% Christians. Among the Chinese, the support is about 50-50. If they could dupe these Christians and Malays, they will have the opportunity to win. They presumed that I had said something two years back. Then the whole group came out to dance and sing and said that I was anti-Christian and anti-Malay, hoping to get some votes in troubled waters.
 
 
 
They are afraid to take up my challenge to have a debate on television because they have been telling lies. People will believe a lie if it is repeated over TV and in the press. As not many people have attended our rallies, I therefore hope that you will telephone your neighbours and friends in Cheng San and tell them what we have said. Only by this means we can have the hope of winning. According to past experience, they will resort to even more insidious means towards the end of the election campaign. I won`t know what they are. I believe it will be coming soon.
 
 
 
I hope you will use your vote to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Singapore. They have gained power through GRCs without voting and entered Parliament to take control of everything. This is the purpose of the GRC. They have attained their aim. They are safe. Why must they still try to stop us from entering Parliament? It`s not kiasu. They are afraid that we will raise all sorts of problems in Parliament, including the sales of properties from HPL.
 
 
 
The PAP and Goh Chok Tong say that the contest in Cheng San is the contest between him and myself. Goh Chok Tong has resorted to hitting below the belt. He said that I am anti-Christian and a Chinese chauvinist. They keep on repeating that because they believe that if a lie is repeated a hundred times, a lie can become truth. I believe that when Cheng San constituents cast their vote, they will tell the PAP that a lie remains a lie.
 
 
 
They say I am a Chinese chauvinist. Yes and no. They say because you continued to serve the Chinese community for such a long time, you are a Chinese chauvinist. What kind of logic is this? All the time I have been with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. I have also been serving in Hwa Chong Junior College and Chinese High School for 20 over years. So they brand me as being interested only in the Chinese community. I agree that because being a Chinese, I am only serving my community. It`s quite natural. If I can be branded as a Chinese chauvinist because of serving my community, I think all those involved in the Chinese, Indian and Malay communities are all chauvinists.
 
 
 
They say I have no courage to bring them to court for injunction. Now the PAP issued an open letter to Singaporeans which read: `Tang Liang Hong does not sue the Prime Minister now because he is scared of being exposed before election.` I think the PAP people do not know the court procedure. Even if I file the papers now, it won`t get a hearing till a year later. It`s not because I am scared of going to court. This election does not concern. My belief, my religion is not put on trial. But they try to digress from the topic of election into trying to put me on trial before Singaporeans. The trial of my character is not the issue of this election. But they try to digress into that. I am not going to dance according to their tune.
 
 
 
The defendant`s statements or part thereof were published, inter alia, in the articles in the 1 January 1997 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
 at p 1 entitled `Tang: Unnecessary to turn Cheng San into personal fight` and `Tang: Why I have not sought court injunction`.
A letter of demand dated 31 December 1996, was sent on behalf of the plaintiff, asking the defendant to, inter alia, withdraw the defamatory statements immediately set out above, and to apologise unreservedly for having said and/or caused the publication of the defamatory statements. The withdrawal and apology had to be read out by the defendant at a rally not later than 9pm on 1 January 1997 and be published on the first page of 
 The Straits Times 
 on 2 January 1997 with sufficient prominence. The letter of demand made it clear that if the defendant did not comply with each of the demands set out therein, the plaintiff would prosecute the action vigorously. No apology was offered. The plaintiff commenced action against the defendant in Suit No 2524/96.
The contents of the plaintiff`s solicitors` letter dated 31 December 1996 were widely publicised in the media, including the 1 January 1997 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
.
The defendant failed to comply with any of the demands of the plaintiff (as set out in his solicitors` letter dated 31 December 1996). A police report was filed by the defendant on or about 1 January 1997, alleging that the plaintiff had, together with the Senior Minister, Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean and Messrs Lee Yock Suan, Ow Chin Hock, Tony Tan, Ker Sin Tze, Chin Harn Tong, Ch`ng Jit Koon, Seng Han Tong and Lee Hsien Loong, systematically, on various occasions and on various dates, alleged and made various statements to make or cause the public to believe, inter alia that: 
(a) The defendant is an anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist; 
(b) The defendant is anti-English educated; and 
(c) that some of the defendant`s statements will cause social and racial disharmony and disruption in Singapore.
The said police report went on to state that the said statements of the plaintiff, the Senior Minister, Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean, and Messrs Lee Yock Suan, Ow Chin Hock, Dr Tony Tan, Ker Sin Tze, Chin Harn Tong, Ch`ng Jit Koon, Seng Han Thong and BG Lee Hsien Loong: 
(a) had incited groups of people to believe that the defendant was an anti-Christian and anti-English-educated persons; 
(b) were likely to incite religious extremists to hate the defendant and cause harm to the defendant and his family; and 
(c) have repeatedly challenged and provoked the defendant to make statements in public which they say may cause social disorder in Singapore.
At a Workers` Party rally held at Yio Chu Kang Stadium on 1 January 1997, the defendant publicly stated that he would not agree to any of the demands and said the following words: 
 
The PAP has given me up to 6pm to say whether I am going to apologise or not. Well what do you think? No!
 
 
 
Ever since my contest in the elections, they have been threatening that I will no longer be a hero after the event. I do not want to be a hero. They have been hinting to you that something untoward may happen to me. Maybe I will disappear henceforth. Regardless of whether I win or lose, or if I cannot see you again after the elections, I bid you farewell now. If I can see you again, I definitely will.
 
 
 
The defendant`s statements at the said rally or part thereof were published, inter alia, in an article in the 2 January 1997 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
, entitled, `Tang refuses to apologise for calling Prime Minister, Senior Minister liars`.
At a press conference at the Hougang Mall on or about 1 January 1997, the plaintiff said that the defendant had not infringed the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (Cap 167A, 1991 Ed) and the Government saw no reason to use the Internal Security Act (Cap 143) against the defendant.
The gist of the plaintiff`s interview was published in the 2 January 1997 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
, in an article entitled: `Tang ""agitating Malay, non-Christian Singaporeans"".`
At the post-election press conference held on or about 3 January 1997, the plaintiff made the following statement, in response to a question raised by one Lee Foong Ming, a reporter with the Television Corporation of Singapore:
 
 
Lee Foong Ming:
 
There was a view among some people that when Mr Tang made his comment about the mosque not being built if the constituency falls into the Opposition, there was a view that he might be charged under the Racial Harmony Act [sic]. What is your comment on that?
 
 
 
The plaintiff:
 
I don`t think Tang Liang Hong has stepped over the limit. No action will be taken, this is an election and we are quite careful. I don`t think he quite agitate the ground, he was careful. He just made a suggestion, he did not go further and we countered the suggestion he made politically.
 
 
 
 
The gist of the plaintiff`s statements were published in the 3 January 1997 edition of 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
.
 The Straits Times 
 The Straits Times 
From newspaper reports, it appeared that the defendant had left Singapore between 3 January 1997 and 4 January 1997. This was set out in the following articles published in the press: 
(1) an article published in the 6 January 1997 edition of entitled `Tang, fearing for his safety, now in Johor, says wife`; and 
(2) an article published in the 8 January 1997 edition of entitled `""Strange"" no police report yet`.
In an article published in the 9 January 1997 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
, entitled `Tang: I left as I couldn`t take death threat lightly`, it was reported, inter alia, that: 
 
He said it was the PAP`s attacks against him which had aroused sentiments against him.
 
 
 
Would he return to Singapore if he received assurances of his safety?
 
 
 
`Oh yes, if they give me an assurance, I will go back,` he said, adding that he would decide what to do over the next few days. He had also not decided if he would seek political asylum in Malaysia, he added.
 
 
 
In the meantime, he would try to explain to Singaporean Christians that he had never attacked the Christian faith, Christians or the church.
 
 
 
He also said he would proceed with his plans to sue Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee, as well as several other PAP MPs, for calling him a liar, but added that he `would need a lot of time to organise himself`.
 
 
 
`Suing them is not my top priority for the moment,` he said.
 
 
 
In an article published in the 9 January 1997 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
 entitled `Tang in seeking refuge: I have genuine sense of fear`, it was reported, inter alia, that: 
 
Declining to disclose his whereabouts yesterday, Mr Tang, who was speaking from a handphone which was registered in Singapore, said he needed to remain outside Singapore to think about the situation he was in.
 
 
 
`I am not playing any games. I have a genuine sense of fear,` he said, in response to a suggestion by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew that he was giving Singapore a reputation of being a terrorist state.
 
 
 
He said that instead of being sympathetic to his plight, the Singapore Government was more concerned about him playing games.
 
 
 
After all, he added, it was the People`s Action Party branding of him as a Chinese chauvinist which created the situation where it was unsafe for him to remain in Singapore.
 
 
 
On or about 10 January 1997, the defendant gave a telephone interview to one Mr Brendan Pereira, a journalist with 
 The Straits Times 
. The interview took place in Malaysia. In the course of the interview, the defendant sought to explain his absence from Singapore and his views on, inter alia, the civil actions which had been commenced by the plaintiff against the defendant, as well as the plaintiffs in Suit No 2523/96 and Suit No 2525/96.
In the course of the interview, the defendant said the offending words which are as follows: 
 
I have to leave Singapore because I have to tell people what I stand for. If not it will be too late. I may be detained and forced to say something.
 
 
 
They were building up this case against me. I can see where it was all heading. I wanted to leave Singapore and be given a chance to tell the world that I am not who they say I am.
 
 
 
Once I go back to Singapore, there is a possibility that I may be locked up and not given a chance to defend myself.
 
 
 
When the defendant was told by Mr Brendan Pereira that the plaintiff had given an assurance that the defendant would not be arrested, the defendant said: 
 
Is that so? I have not heard about it. Do you think I should believe him?
 
 
 
Many years ago, there was some problem at Nanyang University. Lee Kuan Yew told the students that there was nothing to fear. But some of them were arrested a few days later.
 
 
 
I may be arrested under the ISA. Now it is more serious because I have been accused of playing international games.
 
 
 
In the 11 January 1997 edition of 
 The Straits Times 
, the following words which the plaintiff complained were defamatory of him, were published in the article entitled `I fled as I feared being arrested: Tang`: 
 
Mr Tang Liang Hong said last night that besides fearing for his safety, he fled Singapore because he was concerned that he would be arrested by the authorities.
 
 
 
They were building up this case against me. I can see where it was all heading. I wanted to leave Singapore and be given a chance to tell the world that I am not who they say I am.`
 
 
 
`Once I go back to Singapore, there is a possibility that I amy be locked up and not given a chance to defend myself,` he said.
 
 
 
The Workers` Party candidate for Cheng San GRC made these points in a telephone interview.
 
 
 
When told that Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had given an assurance that he would not be arrested, he laughed, adding: `Do you think I should believe him?`
 
 
 
He said that many years ago, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew had given some Nanyang University students a similar assurance. A few days later, some of them were arrested.
 
 
 
Mr Tang, 61, said that he did not discount being arrested under the Internal Security Act, especially since he had been accused of playing `international` games.
 
 
 
By para 37 of the statement of claim the plaintiff averred that the offending words and the words in the article published in 
 The Straits Times 
 of 11 January 1997 in their natural and ordinary meaning and/or by way of innuendo, meant and/or were understood to mean that the plaintiff: 
 
 
(1) had concocted lies about the defendant, and spread them, in conspiracy with the Senior Minister, Rear Adm Teo Chee Hean and Messrs Ker Sin Tze, Ow Chin Hock, Ch`ng Jit Koon, Chin Harn Tong and Seng Han Thong; 
 
(2) had used and will use his power and influence as the Prime Minister of Singapore, to corruptly and illegally suppress and prevent the defendant from contradicting the alleged `lies` which had allegedly been told about the defendant by inter alia, the plaintiff. As a result therefore, the defendant had no choice but to leave Singapore so that he could tell the truth about himself and contradict the alleged `lies`; 
 
(3) has commenced an action against the defendant (by way of Suit No 2524/96) knowing that he (ie the plaintiff) did not have a meritorious claim; 
 
(4) will use his power and influence as the Prime Minister of Singapore, to corruptly and illegally, ensure the defendant`s arrest if he were to return to Singapore, so as to suppress and prevent the defendant from contradicting the alleged lies and to prevent him from defending the civil proceedings which the plaintiff, as well the plaintiffs in Suit No 2523/96 and Suit No 2525/96 had brought against the defendant; 
 
(5) is not a man of his word and the plaintiff cannot be relied upon; and 
 
(6) is not an honest man and/or a man of integrity and/or worthy of trust.
  
 
 
By para 10 of the defence the defendant referred to the averments in para 33 of the statement of claim and admitted that `he is responsible in law for the re-publication in 
 The Straits Times 
 of the words admittedly spoken by him.` It followed that the defendant spoke the offending words in the knowledge and/or with the intention that the offending words should be published in 
 The Straits Times 
. He in effect admitted that he authorised their publication in 
 The Straits Times 
. On the facts as admitted, I am further of the view that the defendant also authorised any re-publication in the mass media of the article in 
 The Straits Times 
. However, he did deny `all other respects of para 33` but the denial, bearing on whether the words were `offending words`, is immaterial to the question of his responsibility in law for the publication and re-publication of the offending words.
By para 36 of the statement of claim the plaintiff averred that the offending words, and the words complained of in the article, referred to, and/or were understood to refer to, inter alia, the plaintiff. This is admitted by the defendant who stated in para 13 of the defence that `(p)ara 36 of the statement of claim is admitted`.
The plaintiff asserted that the offending words and the words published in the article in The 
 Straits Times 
 of 11 January 1997 were calculated to disparage him in the way of his office, profession and/or calling as the Prime Minister of Singapore, as the Secretary-General of the PAP and as member of Parliament and in relation to his conduct in those capacities.
 The natural and ordinary meaning
In considering the bare denial of the defendant that the offending words and the article were defamatory of the plaintiff or were understood to bear the meanings as alleged by the plaintiff, it is useful to bear in mind two basic principles in the law of defamation. They are these. First, where no legal innuendo is alleged to arise from extrinsic circumstances known only to some readers or listeners, the `natural and ordinary meaning` to be ascribed to the publication is the meaning, including any inferential meanings, which the publication read or heard in its entirety and in its context would convey to the ordinary, reasonable, fair-minded reader or listener: see the well-known dicta of Alderson B in 
 Chalmers v Payne 
 (1835) 2 Cr M & R 156 at p 159 and 
 Charleston & Anor v News Group Newspapers Ltd & Anor 
 
[1995] 2 AC 65
. The other basic tenet in the law of libel, which is also applicable in the law of slander, is that although the alleged libellous publication or the alleged slanderous words may convey different meanings to different readers or listeners, a judge in Singapore, as a finder of facts, is required by the common law to determine the 
 single and the right meaning 
 which the publication or words conveyed to the 
 notional reasonable reader or reasonable listener 
 and, having identified it, the judge is then to proceed to consider if it is defamatory of the plaintiff and, if so, he is to base the damages on that meaning and that meaning alone: see 
 Charleston 
 (supra) and the instructive dicta on the determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of slanderous words in Jeyaretnam 
 Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 310
, at 321C-G, per LP Thean J, as he then was. It is true that this second principle proceeds on the assumption that this was the one sense in which all reasonable readers or listeners would have understood it. As a matter of commonsense this assumption has to be made because it is not possible to get the views of each and every reasonable reader or listener. The judge therefore reflects and represents the reasonable reader or reasonable listener.
In setting out the two basic tenets of the law of defamation, it is in my view instructive to recall the penetrating analysis of Diplock LJ (as he then was) in 
 Slim v Daily Telegraph 
 
[1968] 2 QB 157
 at pp 171-174 from which the following passage will be most helpful for present purposes: 
 
Everyone outside a court of law recognises that words are imprecise instruments for communicating thoughts of one man to another. The same words may be understood by one man in a different meaning from that in which they are understood by another and both meanings may be different from that which the author of the words intended to convey. But the notion that the same words should bear different meanings to different men and that more than one meaning should be `right` conflicts with the whole training of a lawyer. Words are the tools of his trade. He uses them to define legal rights and duties. They do not achieve that purpose unless there can be attributed to them a single meaning as the `right` meaning. And so the argument between lawyers as to the meaning of words starts with the unexpressed major premise that any particular combination of words has one meaning which is not necessarily the same as that intended by him who published them or understood by any of those who read them but is capable of ascertainment as being the `right` meaning by the adjudicator to whom the law confides the responsibility of determining it
 
 
 
Where, as in the present case, words are published to the millions of readers of a popular newspaper, the chances are that if the words are reasonably capable of being understood as bearing more than one meaning, some readers will have understood them as bearing one of those meanings and some will have understood them as bearing others of those meanings. But none of that matters. What does matter is what the adjudicator at the trial thinks is the one and only meaning that the readers as reasonable men should have been collectively understood the words to bear. That is the `natural and ordinary meaning` of words in an action for libel
 
 
 
Juries, in theory, must be unanimous upon every issue on which they have to adjudicate; and since the damages that they award must depend upon the defamatory meaning that they attribute to the words, they must all agree upon a single meaning as being the `right` meaning. And so the unexpressed major premise, that any particular combination of words can bear but a single `natural and ordinary meaning` which is `right`, survived the transfer from judge to jury of the function of adjudicating upon the meaning of civil actions for libels.
 
 
 
In principle as well as in practice, it has been seen in case law that a publication or a speech may have a range of possible defamatory meanings. It would not be reasonable to a defendant to pick only the most defamatory of the plaintiff. Equally it is not reasonable to a plaintiff to pick the least defamatory meaning. Lord Blackburn made this point in 
 Capital and Counties Bank v Henry 
 
(1882) 7 App Cas 741
, at p 786. The damages to be awarded has to be proportionate to the exact nature of the defamation.
On behalf of the defendant it was submitted that the meanings relied on by the plaintiff were derived from extrinsic facts, which were matters for evidence to be led at the trial, and were therefore innuendo meanings rather than the natural and ordinary meaning of the words of the defendant. There is no merit in this submission. In my view, no innuendo comes into play at all. Only the ordinary and natural meaning, including any inferential meaning of the words taken in their entirety and context, will be considered by this court.
In the light of the principles set out, I turn to the utterances of the defendant. The interview, it will be recalled, was between the defendant and Mr Brendan Pereira, a journalist with 
 The Straits Times 
 which, as the national newspaper, has a large and influential readership. As for the context, the defendant was seeking to explain his absence from Singapore. He also gave his views on the civil actions including those which had been instituted by the plaintiff against the defendant. He said he had to leave Singapore because he had to tell people what he stood for. He said that if he did not leave Singapore, it would be too late. He said: `I may be detained and forced to say something.` He elaborated by claiming that `they were building up this case against me. I can see where it was all heading.` He repeated that there was a possibility that he might be locked up and not given a chance to defend himself; he was obviously referring to the suits for defamation which had been commenced against him. When told by Mr Brendan Pereira that the plaintiff had given an assurance that the defendant would not be arrested, the defendant said that he had not heard about the assurance. He then asked: `Do you think I should believe him?` He then referred to an event involving the arrests of some Nanyang University students a few days after the Senior Minister had told the students that there was nothing to fear. And he repeated that he might be arrested under the Internal Security Act, pointing out especially there was the new accusation that he was playing `international` games. The article which appeared in The Straits Times on the following day accurately reported the conversation, as the defendant admitted in his defence. The defendant accepted responsibility for it.
In my judgment, the offending words uttered by the defendant and the article conveyed to the mind of the ordinary, reasonable and fair-minded listener and reader that the plaintiff is not an honest man, not a man of integrity and could not be trusted and that the plaintiff most probably would corruptly and illegally use his power and influence as the Prime Minister of Singapore to arrest the defendant under the Internal Security Act were he (the defendant) to return to Singapore with the consequences that he would be forced to say something against himself and that he would not be able to defend himself in the suits brought against him and to contradict the lies which the plaintiff and others had concocted and spread against him. Counsel for the plaintiff has suggested a range of meanings which are set out in the statement of claim. To my mind, not each and every one of all those meanings were conveyed to the ordinary, reasonable and fair-minded listener and reader. In my judgment what I have set out is the single and the right meaning of the utterances and the article.
The next question is whether the offending words and the article in the natural and ordinary meaning as I have found are defamatory of the plaintiff. I have not the slightest doubt that they are. They impute dishonest and dishonourable conduct and propensities against the plaintiff as the Prime Minister of Singapore. They definitely tend to lower the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally: 
 Sim v Stretch 
 [1936] 2 All ER 1237, at p 1240 per Lord Atkin.
I turn next to the defendant`s questions about the identification of the plaintiff. In the submissions made on his behalf, it was conceded that the doubt cast by the defendant on whether the plaintiff`s assurance was to be believed unquestionably referred to the plaintiff. But it was argued that the position was not so clear in respect of the other passages. For example, it was submitted that the words `they were building up a case against him` could possibly refer to the police. There was also the tangential comment that `most people would assume that it is the police and the courts who decide who is to be locked up and not the politicians.` In my view, there is no doubt that the defendant was referring to the plaintiff, among others. Only a deliberately impervious person, after being told the undisputed background as set out above, could think there was any question that the defendant was referring to the plaintiff, among others.
I next deal with the defendant`s contention that the plaintiff`s claim is an abuse of the process of the court. It is pleaded in para 1 of the defence. This contention, as it has turned out, is given much more emphasis in the defendant`s submission than his defences. The other defences and submissions were given almost cursory treatment by those representing the defendant. The submission begins by a reference to the defendant`s belief asserted in an affidavit that the plaintiff`s claim in this suit and what was described as the `related actions` are an abuse of process and should be struck out. The defendant`s belief, in my view, is totally irrelevant. He may well subjectively nurse the impression that all the plaintiffs were acting in concert against him. The test, however, is an objective one, being whether the plaintiff has a reasonable claim for damages for the slander and libel uttered and published with the authority of the defendant. If no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, the defendant could apply to strike out the action, as he attempted to but failed in Suit No 2524/96. As his application itself was devoid of merit and was considered to be frivolous, the defendant was ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis.
Central to this submission is the contention of the defendant that `the inference is irresistible that the law of defamation is being invoked by the plaintiffs in these cases for the ulterior and improper motive of achieving political advantage and for the collateral purpose of driving the defendant from the political arena for fear of the huge potential awards of damages and costs.` In referring to the cases, the defendant was referring to the 12 defamation suits commenced by 11 plaintiffs (including the plaintiff) against him seeking damages from the defendant for a series of defamations which the defendant was alleged to have tortiously committed before and in the wake of the recent Parliamentary General Elections held on 2 January 1997.
This contention, in my view, is wholly fallacious and fails in limine. Whilst it may be fairly said that the plaintiffs in the suits under consideration were robustly seeking their remedies, it is wholly unarguable that they have been seeking to vindicate their good name and reputation. They are claiming substantial damages, which they are perfectly entitled to recover, if they prove the defamations against the defendant. Every civilised legal system must provide a remedy for a tortious wrong and the legitimate pursuit of all lawful remedies, however robust, vigorous, determined and co-ordinated, cannot possibly be an abuse of the process of court.
It bears reminder that it is not the law that politicians of any party can make false and defamatory allegations with impunity. It has been settled law that the Constitution of Singapore differs materially from the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States and from art 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The right of free speech under art 14 of our Constitution is subject to the common law of defamation as modified by the Defamation Act (Cap 75): see 
 Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew 
 (supra). It was also declared as the law in that case that persons holding public office or politicians are equally entitled to have their reputations protected as those of any other persons. It is also the law that criticisms in relation to their official conduct must respect the bounds set by the law of defamation. In my view, the failure on the part of the defendant or those representing him to accept these principles of the law of defamation accounts for the wholly unmeritorious complaint that all the defamation suits are an abuse of the court`s process.
As far as this particular suit is concerned, I have subjected the statement of claim and the defence to the closest scrutiny. There is no doubt in my mind that the defendant has no defence whatsoever for the slander and libel containing the single and the right meaning which I have set out in full. To have allowed the action to go on for trial, when the defendant has no defence whatsoever, would indeed have amounted to an abuse of the process of court.
Finally, I refer to the defence which was raised in the last sentence of para 17 of the defence. I need to repeat the sentence, viz: `It is averred that the plaintiff`s failure to plead that the action for slander is actionable under the law of Malaysia results in the statement of claim disclosing no cause of action.` In the written submissions filed on the defendant`s behalf, it is further argued that, with regard to the claim in libel for causing the publication of the libel in Singapore, the place of the tort (lex loci delicti) is Malaysia and that the publication in Singapore is the place where the damage was suffered. The defendant relies on 
 Slipper v BBC 
 
[1991] 1 QB 283
. I need not revert to this case save to observe immediately that the Court of Appeal in that case dealt with the important questions of a defendant`s liability for the repetition of a libellous publication and whether the damage was too remote. The case does not deal, at any rate directly, with the proposition that a defendant who authorises in Country A the publication in writing of his slander uttered in the same country in a newspaper of Country B commits the tort of libel in Country A and that Country B is where the place where the damage is suffered. In addition, and for the reasons which will be stated in the following part of the judgment, it matters not where the tort of the libel was committed.
The applicable law of the torts - the present law in Singapore
The present law in Singapore on the applicable choice of law rule is based on a passage from the judgment of Willes J in 
 Phillips v Eyre 
 (1870) LR 6 QB 1: 
 
As a general rule, in order to found a suit in England for a wrong alleged to have been committed abroad, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the wrong must be of such a character that it would have been actionable if committed in England. Secondly, the act must not have been justifiable by the place where it was done.
 
 
 
It is generally accepted that this rule has been modified (see McGregor (1970) 33 MLR 1; Karsten (1970) 19 ICLQ 34) by the House of Lords in 
 Boys v Chaplin 
 
[1971] AC 356
. It is difficult to extract a ratio from that case, but as a modification to double actionability rule, it may be departed from in certain appropriate circumstances. Lord Wilberforce, whose judgment has been regarded as authoritative, accepted the normal rule but in 
 Boys v Chaplin 
 (supra) itself applied English law due to the desirability of making the rule flexible enough to `take account of the varying interests and considerations of policy which may arise when one or more foreign elements are present`: ibid at p 391E. Accordingly, I have to take a closer look on how the general rule on double actionability operate in practice.
The correlation of double actionability gives rise to an award based on the overlap of the laws of the lex fori and lex loci. This often results in the plaintiff being disadvantaged by the general rule. For eg in 
 Boys v Chaplin 
 (supra), the operation of the general rule would only have resulted in the recovery of special damages amounting to no more than o53. In 
 M`Elroy v M`Allister 
 (1949) SC 110 the pursuer was denied his claim for solatium under Scottish law since this head of damages was not recoverable under English law (but funeral expenses were recoverable because here there was a correlation between Scots and English law).
The next question is to consider how the flexible exception operate in practice. Two recent cases illustrate the operation and expansion of the exception which results in the application of a particular forum`s law over double actionability. In 
 Johnson v Coventry Churchill International Ltd 
 [1992] 3 All ER 14 the plaintiff, a joiner, entered into what was held to be a contract of employment with the defendant company which placed English personnel seeking to work abroad. The plaintiff worked in Germany and was injured on a building site when the plank on which he was crossing a trench collapsed. Under English law this would give rise to liability for breach of the employer`s duty to provide a safe system of work, but there would be no liability in German law in the absence of a wilful as opposed to negligent breach. It was held that the double actionability rule should be displaced in favour of the application of English law. Applying the relevant rule in 
 Dicey & Morris 
 the judge took the view that England was the country with which the occurrence and the parties had the most significant relationship. The parties were both English, the contract was expressly made subject to English law and the judge found that the fault which gave rise to the accident arose from decisions taken in England that safety issues were not the defendant`s concern. The interests of justice dictated the application of English law, and as the defendants had in fact taken insurance cover against any liability under that law, they would not be disadvantaged. 
 Johnson 
 was a case where the flexible exception operated as an exception to the second limb of 
 Phillips v Eyre 
 (supra), where the wrong in question was actionable by the lex fori and not by the lex loci delicti.
The position has since been altered by the Privy Council decision of 
 Red Sea Insurance v Bouygues SA 
 [1994] 3 All ER 749. The case concerned a counterclaim brought by a defendant insurer against a number of insured parties. The former alleged that the latter were liable to the insurer for loss sustained by the remainder of the insured parties. The counterclaim relied on the fact that such liability existed under the law of Saudi Arabia, the lex loci delicti, but not under that of Hong Kong, the lex fori. The case came before the Privy Council on the assumption that English law and that of Hong Kong were the same. It raised directly the question whether a claimant might succeed in a claim founded on a foreign tort in circumstances in which the wrong is actionable by the lex loci but not under the lex fori. It was decided by the Privy Council that the flexible exception could, in respect of a foreign tort, operate in circumstances where the said wrong was not actionable by the lex fori, but actionable under the lex loci delicti. The significance of the 
 Red Sea 
 decision is that it decides that the flexible exception, which was apparently grafted onto the double actionability test by 
 Boys v Chaplin 
 (supra), operates as an exception to both limbs of that test. (See further Briggs, 
 The Halley 
: holed, but still afloat? (1995) 111 LQR 18.)
 New rules in the UK
In all matters relating to foreign torts, s 11 Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 has now repealed the rule of double actionability in favour of the law of the country in which the events constituting the tort or delict in question occur. What is now applied as a general rule in the UK is the lex loci delicti with a proper law exception (displacement provisions in s 12).
 Tort choice of law and defamation
It is quite clear that the double actionability rule remains part of the common law in Singapore. The new Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 of UK has not been scheduled under Singapore`s Application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Ed). In the United Kingdom the application of the old rules to defamation actions survived the enactment of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995: see s 13. The exclusion of defamation from the Act was the most contentious issue during the passage of the Bill in Parliament, and occurred partly due to media interests in that country. Legislators were reluctant to extend the new rules to defamation actions. The primary difficulty concerns the implication of the reform for the right of free speech of those who make statements in the United Kingdom. If a foreign law is to govern the liability of a defendant who makes a statement in the UK, the defendant could be held liable when under English law he may have had available the defences of absolute or qualified privilege, fair comment or justification, or perhaps all of these. Moreover there may be torts or delicts unknown to English or Scots law but which exist elsewhere which arise from the making of statements, eg invasion of privacy or the right to one`s own image. (See Law Commission`rsquo;s Consultation Paper on Private International Law: Choice of Law in Tort and Delict (1990) at paras 3.28 et seq.)
 Is Phillips v Eyre a choice of law rule, a jurisdictional rule or both?
 
 
 Phillips v Eyre 
 
 
 
 Cheshire & North 
 
It has not been universally accepted that the two-prong rule in 
 Phillips v Eyre 
 provides a rule for the choice of law. Academic opinion sways between three alternative interpretations: 
(i) provides a double-barrelled choice of law rule; 
(ii) It provides a double-barrelled jurisdictional rule, leaving open the choice of law issue; 
(iii) The first part of the rule is jurisdictional whilst the second constitutes a choice of law rule (indicating the application of the law of the place of the tort): see p 540 et seq.
In my view, such characterisations are unnecessary in practice. More importantly, it is the operation of the double actionability rule which results in the ascertainment of a proper law in a given case - usually English law. In 
 Boys v Chaplin 
 Lord Wilberforce quite clearly rejects any suggestion that the first part of 
 Phillips v Eyre 
 relates to jurisdiction: 
[1971] AC 356
 at pp 385-387. His Lordship stated that under that rule, the substantive law to be applied is the law of the forum subject to civil liability under the law of the place, and this view has been accepted by the Court of Appeal in 
 Coupland v Arabian Gulf Oil Co 
 
[1983] 1 WLR 1136
 at p 1154.
That being the case, the question still remains as to whether the rule in 
 Phillips v Eyre 
has to be stated 
 in the pleadings 
 in every given case involving a foreign tort.
The last sentence of para 17 of the defence, which I have set out earlier, raises the question whether the plaintiff has to plead actionability under Malaysian law, which is the law of the place where the slander was uttered and arguably where the tort of authorising the publication was committed. Since the plaintiff has failed to do so in the statement of claim, the question is whether his cause of action for both slander and libel necessarily fails.
Equally clear, in my view, is the general proposition advancing a voluntary rule, which states that where parties do not plead foreign law, Singapore law is applied, subject to exceptions eg where a mandatory pleading of foreign law is required as a matter of law: see further rule 18, 
 Dicey & Morris on Conflict of Laws 
. Counsel for the plaintiff refers to the case of 
 K-Rex Finance Ltd v Cheng Chih Cheng 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 46
 at 51G. The principle is sometimes expressed in the form that foreign law is presumed to be the same as English law until the contrary is proved: 
 Dynamit Actien-Gesellschaft v Rio Tinto Co 
 
[1918] AC 260
; 
 The Parchim 
 
[1918] AC 157
 at p 161; 
 The Colorado 
 [1923] P 102 at p 111; 
 Casey v Casey 
 [1949] P 420 at p 430.
The next question to investigate is whether the requirement of double actionability is one such instance where a mandatory pleading of foreign law is required. There is, in my judgment, no requirement for a plaintiff to plead actionability under a foreign law. If the plaintiff does not allege that the defendant`s acts are wrongful under the law of the place of the tort, a tort claim involving foreign elements may be treated as if it is a domestic Singapore case: 
 Schneider v Elsovitch 
 
[1960] 2 QB 430
; 
 Winkworth v Hubbard 
 [1960] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 150; 
 Astro Vencedor Compania Naviera SA of Panama v Mabanaft GmbH 
 
[1971] 2 QB 588
 and see further 
 Cheshire & North 
 (12th Ed) at p 540.
It may be fairly observed that the requirement of correlation of actionability in 
 Phillips v Eyre 
 does not sit well with the voluntary rule in respect of pleading foreign law. At least one English judge has stated that where the tort in question occurred in another forum, it is desirable, if not essential that the statement of claim should allege that the act complained of is wrongful by the lex loci delicti. Du Parq LJ`s judgment in 
 Yorke v British & Continental Steamship Co Ltd 
 (1945) 78 Lloyd LR 18 is particularly instructive. This was a case where the defendants were found liable for negligence from their failure to replace the hatch covers in a ship, causing the plaintiff to fall from the `tween decks into the lower hold of the ship when it was docked at the Gibraltar harbour (foreign tort). Their appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Du Parq LJ did not write the leading judgment but said this: 
 
But I just want to add this. I think that in a case of this kind it is desirable, and indeed it may be essential, strictly speaking, that the statement of claim should allege that the act complained of - negligence in this case - is a wrongful act by the law of the country where the tort is alleged to have been committed. It is perhaps rather pedantic to say anything more about it in this case, but as anybody reading a report of this case, if it is reported, will see it is a matter arising from what is foreign territory for the purposes of this case, it is perhaps as well to make it clear that on that point the matter was dealt with. If it had been alleged in this case that the act in question was a wrongful act by the law of Gibraltar, an admission would at once have been made that that was so - and nobody would suggest that the law of Gibraltar is different from the law of England on this subject, and I think we are bound to assume that the law of Gibraltar is the same as that of this country in regard to the matter (ibid at p 184).
 
 
 
In my view, the concerns of Du Parq LJ are equally applicable to this case. The option of pleading actionability under a foreign law (or the lack of it, as the case may be) is equally open to, and is frequently invoked by a defendant, where the application of the general rule exonerates him under the lex fori or lex loci delicti. An example in which the defendant may rely on the protection of the lex loci where he is later excused from liability for his wrong by a competent authority in the country where he acted, eg by an act of indemnity. In fact, this happened in 
 Phillips v Eyre 
.
In my judgment and at the end of the day, the 
 key question 
 in this case is: 
 has the defendant pleaded under para 17 of the defence some exoneration in respect of his slander (and the tort of authorising the libel) through the invocation of a choice of law rule? 
 In my view he has not, since he only tries to argue that the statement of claim discloses no cause of action for slander because of the plaintiff`s failure to plead actionability under Malaysian law. As stated above, there is no obligation on either party to plead foreign law, nor raise any point of foreign law through invoking some choice of law rule to his advantage. Neither party having done so in this case, Singapore law applies to the slander and to the defendant`s tort of authorising the publication of the libel in question, in the absence of any conflict of laws. It follows inexorably that there is no need to apply double actionability, nor any exception thereto.
My concluding observations are as follows. The emerging picture is one where the rule of double actionability in 
 Phillips v Eyre 
, as modified by 
 Boys v Chaplin 
 and emasculated in the 
 Red Sea 
 decision, is a requirement which has to be satisfied 
 only 
 where a 
 conflict of laws is raised by the pleadings 
, typically where a defendant pleads a defence or a lack of actionability or equivalent liability under the lex loci delicti. It is then up to a plaintiff to aver for the application of the lex fori, if that is his preferred law of choice, as the proper law or lex causae governing the tort. In the absence of any conflict of laws, or where there is a `zero conflict` factor, the lex loci delicti and the lex fori are treated as the same. A judge in that case applies the law of the forum in which he sits.
For these reasons, it is ordered that the defence filed by the defendant on 4 March 1997 be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(a) of the Rules of Court 1996, and that judgment be entered against the defendant with damages (including aggravated damages) to be assessed. It is further ordered that the costs of the action including the costs of this application be taxed and paid by the defendant to the plaintiff on an indemnity basis. This action has been unavoidably brought by the plaintiff to ensure that the defendant`s serious defamation against him as the Prime Minister of Singapore and as a man should not be made with impunity. In my view, it would be unreasonable for the plaintiff to bear any part of the solicitor and client`s costs in this matter in which he has to seek vindication of his good name.

The above case having come to my attention, I called for and examined the records of the proceedings in the district court, pursuant to my powers under s 266 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). I concluded that the facts of the case were not such as to merit a charge under s 354A of the Penal Code (a provision mandating a sentence of caning upon conviction), nor were they such as to merit the sentence of two years` imprisonment and three stokes of the cane imposed.
Briefly, the facts of this case were as follows: the accused and his victim met on the footpath outside an MRT station, where he tried to kiss her. In resisting his advances, she fell to the ground, whereupon he pressed his body on top of hers and forcibly kissed her lips. In reviewing the case, I had regard in particular to the following circumstances: the accused and the victim were actually engaged to be married; the scuffle which took place between them on the footpath appeared to be more in the nature of a tiff over the degree of physical contact to be allowed in their relationship; the victim suffered no injury, nor did the accused try at any stage to touch her private parts. According to the mitigation plea put forth by the accused`s counsel below, the victim was subsequently prepared to forgive the accused and he in turn had every intention of marrying her. Indeed, he was clearly extremely remorseful, for immediately after he had committed his rash act, he surrendered himself to the MRT staff to whom the victim made her complaint; and when criminal proceedings were brought, he was quick to plead guilty.
For these reasons, I am of the view that the charge under s 354A should be substituted with a charge under s 354, that is a charge of assault or use of criminal force to a person with intent to outrage her modesty; and I do so order in exercise of my powers under s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code read with s 268(1). The sentence of two years` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane imposed by the district judge is set aside. The accused is to serve, instead, a sentence of imprisonment commencing on 22 March 1997 (the date on which he was remanded) and ending on 11 June 1997.",1997-06-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

The respondents were acquitted by the magistrate of charges relating to the employment of illegal foreign workers. The prosecution appealed. After hearing arguments from the prosecution, this court dismissed the appeal. As the issues raised were of some importance, I set out below my reasons for dismissing the appeal.
The first charge against the first respondents was as follows:
 
You, Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd of 163 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4, [num ]01-480 S 560163 are charged that you, from on or about mid-October 1994 to mid-December 1994 at Lorong M, Telok Kurau, Singapore, did employ a foreign worker, namely one Lim Kim Teah (MBIC No: 550725-08-5387) when you had not obtained in respect of the said Lim Kim Teah a valid work permit allowing him to work for you, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A) punishable under s 5(4) of the same Act.
 
 
 
The second charge was in the same terms, save that it involved another foreign worker, one Lee Wooi Sang. The second respondent, the managing director of the first respondents, was charged as follows:
 
You, Tan Kim Seng, NRIC No SS180509F, of Blk 114 Yishun Ring Road [num ]04-579 S 760114, are charged that you on or about 23 September 1994 were a managing director of Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd of 163 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 [num ]01-480 S 560163 which had from on [sic] or about mid-October 1994 to mid-December 1994 committed an offence of employing a foreign worker, namely one Lim Kim Teah (MBIC No: 550725-08-5387) without having obtained a valid work permit allowing him to work for the said company under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A), and the commission of which offence was attributable to your neglect, and you have thereby by virtue of s 5(6), committed an offence under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A) punishable under s 5(4) of the same Act.
 
 
 
 
 The facts
 
The two workers, Tan and Lim, gave evidence that they had sought and obtained work from one Ang Lye Thiam (Ang) in October 1994. Ang assigned them to paint at a house at Lorong M Telok Kurau. There, the two worked seven hour days, six days a week until December 1994. They were paid by Ang, whom they considered their `boss`. Ang himself gave evidence that the two were indeed employed by him. However, Ang claimed that he was not an employee of the first respondents, but a sub-contractor. The respondents were not consulted by him on the employment of the workers nor did they pay the workers` salaries.
The prosecution sought to impeach Ang`s credit using a statement given by him earlier. The inconsistent portions of that statement disclosed that Ang had employed the workers on behalf of the second respondent, and that the second respondent would apply for work permits for them if he found them suitable. Ang`s explanation for the statement was that it was made in relation to another occasion when the workers had been working at the National University of Singapore. He had also meant to say in the statement that he sought the second respondent`s help in trying to obtain permits for the workers as he himself could not do so.
The second respondent was the only witness for the defence. He testified that the work at Telok Kurau had been sub-contracted by the main contractor to the first respondents, who in turn sub-contracted it, without any profit, to Ang. The second respondent said that he had no say in the employment of the workers, nor had he met them. A number of vouchers recording payments made to Ang were put in by the defence.
 The decision
The magistrate could not accept that all the work had been sub-contracted to Ang, without any profit for the first respondents. The vouchers tendered as evidence of payment to Ang only totalled about $29,000, while the contract value was actually $120,000. There was no reasonable basis for such a transaction. Be that as it may, the untruthfulness of the respondents about this did not show that Ang was their employee or agent. Neither did it show any neglect on the second respondent`s part.
Ang was the only available link between the workers and the respondents. The workers themselves considered Ang as their `boss`. Ang`s evidence was not satisfactory, particularly as he seemed unable to answer adequately and was unclear about the relationship between the respondents and him. His credit was impeached but no reliance could be placed on his prior inconsistent statement as the statement was made about a year after the employment, and Ang was shown to be a rather easily confused person: 
Foong Seow Ngui & Ors v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 785
 [distd] .
No link between the workers and the respondents having been established, the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the respondents were thus acquitted.
 The petition of appeal
The prosecution contended that the magistrate failed to draw the appropriate inferences from the evidence. He ought to have given sufficient weight to the prior inconsistent statement: 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
  . Ang`s failure to explain that statement was not caused by any confusion. Rather it was an attempt to prevaricate. Ang`s explanation that it was a reference to work at NUS could not stand: the statement was simple, and was recorded with the assistance of an interpreter. It was noteworthy that mention was made in the statement of the worksite being at Telok Kurau. Although the statement was recorded a year after the period of employment, such employment could not be subject to the vagaries of memory. In any event, both workers also stated that they had worked at Telok Kurau during the material time. And in the end, the magistrate ought to have looked at the evidence as a whole to determine how much weight to attach to the statement: s 147(5) Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) referred to.
At the conclusion of the trial, the magistrate had sufficient evidence before him to convict the respondents. It was shown that the respondents were the real employers of the workers. The second respondent`s claim that he had sub-contracted the work to Ang was incredible as it gave no profit. Ang claimed that he had obtained the sub-contract and paid the workers, but there were no written records of these. An employment inspector, one Jason Ang, gave evidence that Ang admitted to him that he had employed the workers on behalf of the second respondent. Jason Ang also concluded from the second respondent`s statement that he had employed the workers through Ang. This was not challenged by the respondents. Though payments were supposed to have been received by Ang for the sub-contract, the receipts did not correspond with the amount received. Additionally, these receipts were in-house documents of the first respondent, and were not independent evidence. The second respondent testified in court that he had informed Ang not to hire illegal foreign workers as the project belonged to the second respondent. He also admitted that he told the investigating officer that Ang and he were partners.
The magistrate ought not to have found as he did that the statement did not record what Ang actually said. Ang himself did not disclaim the statement, and the investigating officer`s testimony as to what Ang had told him was not challenged. The statement itself was simple and nothing showed that Ang did not understand its contents, particularly as the statement had been recorded through an interpreter.
 The appeal
The commission of the alleged offence occurred from October to December 1994. The relevant edition of the Act was that of 1991; subsequent amendments introduced in 1995 and that came into force in 1996 did not apply. Section 5 of the 1991 Act reads:
 
 
(1) No person shall employ a foreign worker unless he has obtained in respect of the foreign worker a valid work permit which allows the foreign worker to work for him. 
 
... 
  
 
 
 
(4) Any person who fails to comply with or contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall -
 
(a) be liable on conviction to a fine of an amount of not less than 24 months` levy and not more than 48 months` levy or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both; 
 
... 
  
 
 
 
(5) For the purpose of subsection (4) -
 
(a) `levy` means the monthly rate of levy applicable to the foreign worker at the date when he was found to be working without a valid work permit, and a certificate issued by the Controller and tendered in court shall be prima facie evidence of such rate; 
 
... 
  
 
 
 
(6) When any offence under subsection (1) committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate or any person purporting to act in any such capacity, he as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
  
 
 
In order to succeed against the first respondent, the company, the prosecution needed to show that the elements of the offence were made out, namely (i) employment of a worker, and (ii) the absence of a valid work permit. There was no dispute that no permits were issued for either of the two workers in question here. As for the second respondent, the prosecution had to establish (i) that the company committed the offence, (ii) he was a director of the company at that time and (iii) the employment occurred as a result of his neglect.
 Employment
Section 6 provides for a presumption of employment:
 
A person found working in any premises or found in possession of any tool or implement or engaged in any activity which may give rise to the inference that he is doing any work shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have been employed by the occupier of the premises.
 
 
 
However, on the facts of this case, there was no evidence that the workers were found working in the premises, with any tools or engaged in anything which would have led to the inference that the workers were doing any work. Indeed, the evidence seemed to be that the investigations arose some time later since the Employment Inspector, Jason Ang, testified that the investigations conducted arose out of a referral by the police.
Since no presumption operated, the prosecution had to prove employment by the respondents beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no definition of employment in the 1991 Act. Some guidance may however be derived from the consideration of the concept in the context of the Immigration Act (Cap 133), which was discussed in 
Lee Boon Leng Joseph v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 445
  , a decision of this court. The version of the Immigration Act under consideration there provides a definition of the term `employ`:
 
... to engage or use the service of any person and to pay such person for services rendered or work done or to remunerate such person on a piece rate or on a commission basis.
 
 
 
The court then said:
 
In 
PP v Heng Siak Kwang
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 274
  , I had occasion to consider this definition. In the course of that judgment, I said at p 280:
 
 
 
`The manner of remuneration and control over the workers would often be of great significance. If an employer merely paid the foreman a lump sum for the workers, and left it to him to decide how much to pay the workers and how many workers to employ, it is a strong indication that the foreman was a sub-contractor if the foreman was permitted to keep the excess. This suggests that it was the foreman who employed the workers. If the employer decided how much to pay each worker and merely used the foreman as a conduit, then it might well be the case that the foreman was not a sub-contractor even if he might have physically recruited the workers ... What was, however, reasonably clear in the present case, was that in order for the respondent to be said to have employed the workers, there must be a contract of some sort between him and the workers.`
 
 
 
The manner of remuneration and the degree of control of the workers are therefore two significant considerations in determining the existence of an employment relationship for the purposes of the Act. This is so even in the case of the amended legislation which came into effect on 1 March 1996 (see 
Ramli Bin Daud v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 225
  ) although the amended legislation dispenses with what seems to be a strict requirement of remuneration under the old definition. It is further important to recognise that the inquiry is always one into the substance of the relationship and not its form (see 
PP v Baby Yap
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 633
  ).
 
 
 
While that was in the context specifically of a statutory definition of the term referring clearly to engagement and remuneration as relevant factors, the approach may provide some guidance generally. It is noted as well that the amended Immigration Act definition was also incorporated into the Employment of Foreign Workers Act in 1996, but this cannot control the meaning of the term as used in the Act before 1996.
The approach taken in 
 Lee Boon Leng Joseph 
 examines factors similar to those considered in 
Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance
 
[1968] 2 QB 497
 where it was held that in determining whether a person is an independent contractor or an employee, regard should be had to the control over the worker, the distribution of risk of loss, the provision of equipment and the method of payment. The approach there referred explicitly to more factors than the Immigration Act requires. In the view of this court, as presently advised, the Immigration Act mandates that greater consideration be given to the notions of control and remuneration than the other criteria listed in 
 Ready Mixed Concrete 
.
Bearing in mind the obvious purpose of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act, which is the regulation of foreigners working in Singapore, the offence creating section is clearly targetted at those having a direct say in whether such foreigners are able to work here; in that respect, both control and remuneration would be the most crucial factors indicating employment. Such control has to be real and substantial. It will not be absent simply because a layer of contracts or corporations is interposed between the putative employer and employee. But neither will it be present simply because the putative employer happens to have some say in the affairs of an intermediary, for example, if that intermediary is a subsidiary. The prosecution has to establish that real and substantial control beyond a reasonable doubt. As advised at present, this approach applies equally in the wake of the 1996 amendments to the Act in cases where the presumption introduced then is not operative.
The prosecution`s case here was that Ang was an employee or an agent of the respondents. The reasoning was that, if he were either, his retention of the workers would also make these workers employees of the respondent. But this did not necessarily follow. The hidden assumption in this reasoning was that Ang acted within the scope of his employment or agency. The prosecution had to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt as well. As it was, because of the findings made, the primary consideration here was the question of Ang`s employment.
 The evidence of employment
Ang`s testimony
Ang`s own evidence was unclear about his relationship with the respondents. Ang at various points referred to the second respondent as both his `boss` as well as his partner. It seemed that in some situations he would be a sub-contractor of the work, and in others he would be brought in to assist the second respondent`s work. However, in his testimony, Ang was adamant that he was not employed by the second respondent:
 
 
Q: [The second respondent] is your `boss`, what do you mean by that? 
 
A: He is the one who `sub`s` the project ... and I `sub` it from him.
  
 
 
And he disclosed that he had sub-contracted the Lorong M work:
 
 
A: Lorong M is not a big project and I sub it from him.
  
 
 
Ang further indicated that he paid the workers himself out of the money he obtained from the sub-contract:
 
 
Q: You get the money as sub-contractor and pay the workers salary? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
In these circumstances, it did not seem material that at other times he referred to the money received from the second respondent as a salary.
The thrust of Ang`s testimony was that there was some form of informal arrangement between Ang and the second respondent; in some situations he would work alongside the respondents, and in others, he and his workers would work alone. In either situation, legally speaking there would be a sub-contract of some sort, but Ang restricted the use of that term to the latter.
Ang`s testimony did not support the prosecution`s case. It did not indicate any control by the second respondent over either Ang or the workers. For that reason, the prosecution sought to rely on the inconsistent statement made by Ang. The only sufficient evidence to support the contention that he was employed by the respondents was contained in the prior inconsistent statement.
 The prior inconsistent statement
The introduction of the prior inconsistent statement
This was a statement recorded in October 1995, about a year after the material time. The magistrate found that the statement was only inconsistent in parts and only allowed those parts into evidence. The statement, in so far as it was possibly inconsistent with Ang`s testimony in court, was as follows:
 
 
1 I want to amend para 1 of my previous statement on 2 October 1995 because I remember the facts wrongly. I did not recruit `Wei Seng` to work at the construction site at Tampines but I had employed him to work another construction site at Lorong M. Besides recruiting `Wei Seng`, I also recruited `Ah Bee` to work at the construction site at Lorong M somewhere in mid-October 1994. The construction site is located at Telok Kurau and is used for the construction of one block of four-storey private housing. 
 
... 
 
3 At the construction site at Lorong M, my employer, `Jin Chen` [the second respondent] had subcontracted painting works at the said site from Sum Keong Construction Pte Ltd. My employer, `Jin Chen` had a written contract with Sum Keong Construction Pte Ltd. For the subcontract painting works at the construction site at Lorong M, `Jin Chen` did not further subcontract the painting works to any other company or to any other person(s). The entire contract for the painting works at the Lorong M construction site is handled by Tan Kim Seng Pte Ltd ... 
 
... 
 
5 After `Wei Seng` and `Ah Bee` had started working for two to three days, I told my employer, `Jin Chen`, that there were two Malaysians that wanted to work at the Lorong M site. `Jin Chen` told me to let them work first and if they are found suitable for the job, he would try to apply work permit for them. 
 
... ... 
 
11 My employer, `Jin Chen`, gave me the authority to employ Singaporean and Malaysian workers. However, if I recruit Malaysian workers, I have to inform `Jin Chen` within a few days of their recruitment. `Jin Chen` would then make the final decision as to whether to employ them further. I do not need to inform `Jin Chen` whenever I recruit Singaporean workers. 
 
12 I admit recruiting `Wei Seng` and `Ah Bee` on the behalf of my employer, `Jin Chen` to work as painter at the construction site at Lorong M without any valid work permits. Both `Jin Chen` and myself were aware that `Wei Seng` and `Ah Bee` were Malaysians when they were employed to work as painters at the construction site at Lorong M.
  
 
 
The prosecution`s contention was in essence that [para ] 3, 5, 11 and 12 were materially contradictory in that they might indicate, through the reference to the second respondent as Ang`s employer, a relationship between Ang and him, and thus between him and the workers. The magistrate however, thought that only [para ] 5 and 12 contained material contradictions. This court accepted that these paragraphs were contradictory, but so was [para ] 11. The magistrate thought it was not because no evidence of authority had been given by Ang. Though that was true, Ang`s testimony was that there was no relationship of employment, and that no consultation was made about the employment of the workers. Paragraph 11 stated that Ang was so employed, and that authority was conferred through that employment. There were thus two conflicting versions of events. They could not exist alongside each other. Hence they were contradictory. But as found by the magistrate, [para ] 3 was not contradictory as it dealt only with the relationship between the second respondent and the main contractor.
By virtue of s 157, Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed), Ang`s credit could be impeached by the prosecution using the prior inconsistent statement, provided there was consent of the court. Such impeachment would require that the contradictions materially affected the witness` credibility. It did not necessarily however mean that the whole of the witness` evidence was rejected: 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 701
  . Here the contradictions concerned the precise nature of the relationship between Ang and the second respondent. It hinged on the use of the term `employ` by Ang in his statement. However, no explanation was given by Ang which indicated that the term was used in any other sense. Ang also explained that he had made the statement in respect of another period of employment, but, given the specificity of the reference to Telok Kurau, this could not be true. In view of all of this, the contradictions were material and affected Ang`s credibility as a witness.
In addition to the impeachment of Ang`s credit, the prosecution sought to use the prior statement for the truth of the facts stated. The use of prior inconsistent statements for the truth of the facts stated was approved by this court in 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
  . The statutory basis for it is s 147 of the Evidence Act, which reads:
 
 
(1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined, without such writing being shown to him or being proved; but if it is intended to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him. 
 
... 
 
(3) Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence would be admissible. 
 
(4) Where a person called as a witness in any proceedings is cross-examined on a document used by him to refresh his memory, that document may be made evidence in those proceedings; and where a document or any part of a document is received in evidence by virtue of this subsection, any statement made in that document or part by the person using the document to refresh his memory shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible. 
 
(5) In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts. 
 
(6) Notwithstanding any other written law or rule of practice requiring evidence to be corroborated or regulating the manner in which uncorroborated evidence is to be treated, a statement which is admissible in evidence by virtue of this section shall not be capable of corroborating evidence given by the maker of the statement.
  
 
 
Ang accepted that he made the statement.
That statement could be used for the truth of the facts stated in regard to: (i). Ang`s labelling of the relationship; and
 (ii). The control exerted over Ang.
 
 
However, (i) was not relevant. Though Ang used the term `employer` in his statement, and the indications were that Ang knew of the implications of the term, all that such use went to show was that Ang labelled the relationship between him and the second respondent as employment. This was not enough. The prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that in substance the relationship was indeed one of employment.
The statement was only useful then as evidence of control by the second respondent. In weighing the evidence, consideration was given to s 147(5) as noted by this court in 
 PP v Sng Siew Ngoh 
, at p 157:
 
The dangers of falsification and inaccuracy, to which all out of court, evidence is prone, are recognised and highlighted. So long as these are borne in mind, there is nothing inherently wrong in admitting inconsistent statements for the truth of the facts stated contained in them.
 
 
 
Factors to be considered
The contemporaneity of a statement with an incident is important for it guards against inaccuracy. However, the degree of contemporaneity that is required will vary with the facts in question. The recollection of the details of particular events, particularly where these occur quickly, is easily susceptible to error with time. However, the recollection of the existence of a relationship, such as of employment, is not so malleable.
Subsection (5) refers as well to the possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement. There can be little guidance on this; the court must be astute in weeding out such instances.
In addition to the above matters, which are explicitly referred to, the weight to be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by an explanation of the inconsistency, and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of the facts.
Regard should be had to the context of the statement. Subsection (5) does not restrict consideration to only the making of the statement, but requires consideration of all the circumstances affecting its accuracy. Thus, the court must consider the context of the inconsistent portions, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined. Reliance cannot be placed on a portion of a statement that is taken out of context. In practice, it is necessary for the defence to be given a copy of the whole statement, so that counsel may assist the court in putting the portion used in context.
Finally, the cogency and coherence of the facts to be relied upon has to be noted. An ambivalent statement does not attract much weight.
The weight that should be accorded
In this appeal consideration had to be had of all the factors above as they applied generally as well as specifically to certain paragraphs. Taking all the inconsistent portions together first, it was noted that the magistrate found that the circumstances warranted that little weight should be attached to the statement as it was made about a year after the incident in question, and was not contemporaneous with the occurrence of the events. However, whether Ang was an employee of the respondents was a fact which could not have been affected by difficulties in recollection. It followed that the passage of a year after the relationship ended before the making of the statement could not have affected its accuracy. And no allegation of misrepresentation was raised by Ang, nor was there any evidence of it.
Ang offered an explanation that the statement was made in respect of another occasion. Since this reference raised issues of similar fact evidence if it was true, the admission of the statement would have had to be measured against the likelihood of prejudice against the accused persons. The initial consideration though had to be whether the statement was in fact in relation to the events which were the subject matter of the charge. The statement contained several references to the site being at Lorong M, and to the period being October to December 1994. In view of this, Ang`s explanation could not be accepted. Ang attempted a further explanation, saying that all that he had meant to say in the statement was that he had requested the second respondent to get work permits for the workers as he himself could not do so. But this went against the literal meaning of the statement that he gave, particularly in [para ] 12.
Turning then to specific paragraphs, in [para ] 5 of the statement, Ang stated that he informed the second respondent that he had two workers. Allegedly, the second respondent instructed that they were to be tried out first, and that he would seek permits for them if found suitable. This could have indicated that the second respondent had some control over the employment of the workers. However, it could not go so far, for it could have equally indicated only that the second respondent would have been willing to apply for permits on Ang`s behalf. That this may be an offence was irrelevant in this appeal.
As for [para ] 11, that disclosed that Ang had authority from the second respondent to recruit workers. If true, this showed that the second respondent, and hence the first respondents as well, exerted some control over the activities of Ang. However, the weight to be placed on this part was very much reduced by the context from which it was taken. The evidence in the rest of the statement indicated that Ang was the one who paid the workers and supervised them. There was no indication in the statement that Ang`s supervision was under the control of the respondents. Thus any authority Ang had to recruit was largely negatived by the absence of any evidence that Ang`s supervision of the workers was ultimately subject to the respondents` control.
In view of the circumstances affecting the statement as noted above, the weight to be accorded to the inconsistent parts concerning the control exerted over Ang by the second respondent was minimal. It was noted that the prosecution submitted in court that the magistrate had wrongly considered that the statement did not record what Ang said because Ang was in his view an easily confused person. In view of the findings above, this was immaterial.
 Other evidence
Ang`s credit being impeached, the other direct evidence in the case came only from the workers and the second respondent. The workers however showed no knowledge of the second respondent, and indicated that all of their activities were controlled by Ang, and that it was Ang who paid them their wages.
Evidence was given by the second respondent that he had sub-contracted the project to Ang without providing for any profit for his company. That was odd, and it raised the likelihood that the second respondent was being less than honest about his relationship with Ang, and how their transactions were arranged. However, even if the second respondent had lied about this, the lie did not by itself show that the second respondent had employed either Ang or the workers. A lie may amount to corroboration of contrary evidence: 
R v Lucas
 
[1981] QB 720
 . It must be shown that the lie is deliberate, that it relates to a material issue, and that it is made out of a realisation of guilt. However, the lie here, if it was one, was about the precise amount paid out to Ang. That by itself would not indicate the nature of the relationship between the second respondent and Ang, which was the material issue. Something more was required.
The prosecution relied on the evidence of Jason Ang, the employment inspector. That witness had testified in cross-examination as follows:
 
 
Q: How did you find out who`s the employer? 
 
A: In the statement of the two workers, they claimed to be recruited by Ang Lye Thiam. Ang claimed that he had done so on behalf of the defendant [the second respondent]. He said that whenever he recruit Malaysian worker he needs to consult his boss Mr Tan Kim Seng and he said that he told Tan Kim Seng about the recruitment of the two workers. Mr Tan admits employing the two workers in his statement. 
 
Q: What else? 
 
A: I took a statement from Mr Tan himself to ascertain the facts. 
 
Q: Did you call Tan again for a statement? 
 
A: Yes I did. 
 
Q: What did you find out? 
 
A: I concluded from the statement that Mr Tan had employed the worker through Mr Ang Lye Thiam.
  
 
 
Anything said by Ang to Jason Ang was hearsay, and inadmissible for the truth of the facts stated. Similarly as regards anything said by the second respondent to Jason Ang. If there was a confession by the second respondent, that should have been sought to be admitted in the normal way. As noted by the magistrate, there was no attempt to admit it and the prosecution could not rely on Jason Ang`s testimony in order to do so by the back door.
 Whether the elements were made out
The prosecution had to show that there was a relationship of control and payment between the respondents and Ang, and between Ang and the workers. The former was the crucial relationship, for if that was not established, the latter did not arise for discussion.
In the end there was insufficient evidence of control. The only evidence which remotely supported the prosecution`s case was the prior inconsistent statement made by Ang. Some parts indicated that there was some control exerted by the second respondent over Ang, but only minimal weight could be given to them. No other evidence was available. It being found that Ang`s credit was impeached, it followed that his evidence in court about the relationship was immaterial The workers did not give any evidence in support of the prosecution`s case, and neither did the second respondent.
The prior inconsistent statement failed to indicate any evidence that the second respondent was responsible for Ang`s remuneration as an employee. Even if the second respondent and Ang lied in court about the payment for the subcontract, this did not supply evidence which would have supported the prosecution`s case. The payment vouchers adduced by the second respondent did not indicate payment to Ang of any salary. Ang`s evidence that he kept the excess of money paid to him by the respondent over payment to the workers could not be accepted because of the impeachment; if it could have been considered, it would have indicated that Ang was a sub-contractor: 
PP v Heng Siak Kwang
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 274
  . Be that as it may, in the end, the prosecution still did not adduce any evidence of payment by the second respondent to Ang of any salary.
Finally, there was no evidence anywhere of any relationship directly between the workers and the second respondent. There was no evidence of direct control by the second respondent of the workers, and there was nothing to indicate that the second respondent paid the workers using Ang as a conduit. It was true that on Ang`s own testimony he only paid the workers after receiving money from the respondents. Even if this part of the testimony was not impeached, it went no further than to show that Ang had an inadequate cash flow. This was not sufficient to show that Ang was a mere conduit.
The various submissions made by the prosecution that the second respondent and Ang were lying about their relationship did not advance the prosecution`s case at all; they did not establish the elements of the offence. Even if accepted, these submissions merely negatived the evidence of the second respondent and Ang.
The prosecution had not therefore proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The charge against the first respondent was not established; consequently that against the second respondent also failed.
 Conclusion
In the circumstances, there was no case made out that the workers were in the employ of the respondents. Accordingly the appeal was dismissed.",1997-06-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

The appellant was convicted on a charge of abetting by instigation the commission of housebreaking and theft by night, contrary to s 457 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) read with s 34. The persons the appellant were alleged to have abetted were Narendran s/o Govindaraj (PW5), Ramesh s/o Ramachandra (Ramesh), Suraj Babu s/o Mndraju (DW2), Selvam s/o Munusamy (also known as Veera) and one Subramaniam (Steven). The theft took place on 7 September 1992 at about 1am at the British Club. I will refer to this incident as the `British Club break-in`.
 The prosecution`s evidence
The prosecution relied solely on PW5`s testimony. PW5 is currently serving six years` corrective training for a series of offences. On 19 December 1992, he pleaded guilty to the British Club break-in, together with some other offences. He was, on that occasion, sentenced to a total of four years and four months` imprisonment. There was no mention of the appellant in the statement of facts which he admitted to on that occasion. In that statement of facts, he had agreed that the burglary was planned by Steven. PW5 said that he implicated the appellant in 1996 because he had `a guilty conscience` and that it `was not fair` that the appellant had escaped unpunished.
On 3 June 1996, PW5 was arrested by the police on suspicion of a housebreaking at a building known as the Leksun Industrial Building which occurred the previous day. He also implicated the appellant in that break-in, which I will refer to as the `Leksun break-in`. It was common ground that the appellant had nothing to do with that offence. The appellant was arrested on the same day as a result of PW5`s accusation. The only explanation PW5 proferred for implicating the appellant in the Leksun break-in was that he was confused because he faced seven other charges at the time.
PW5 first met the appellant sometime in the middle of 1992. The appellant was a security guard at BP Singapore Pte Ltd when PW5 started work there. A few days later, the appellant was transferred to another location. They kept in touch with each other over the phone.
According to PW5, the appellant telephoned him and asked him if he was interested in breaking into the British Club. The appellant gave him the details concerning the location of the British Club and what items could be found there. The appellant told PW5 that Steven would give him the details of how it was to be done. One or two days later, Steven went alone to PW5`s workplace. PW5 said that this was not the first time that he met Steven. They discussed the break-in in a taxi when they left. Steven suggested a date but said that he wanted to discuss with the appellant first. Steven also said that he would check with the appellant concerning other details.
The next day, PW5 talked to Ramesh and DW2 about the planned burglary. They were initially reluctant but eventually agreed to participate. Ramesh and DW2 were good friends of PW5. PW5`s evidence was that he told them that the appellant provided the information about the British Club.
A few days later, PW5 went to the appellant`s office. Steven was also present. The appellant told PW5 that there were no close-circuit television cameras inside the British Club. The appellant told him that the burglary would take place on 7 September 1992. Only the three of them were present at this meeting. I noted, however, that PW5 said in cross-examination at one stage that this was the first time he discussed the break-in at the British Club with Steven, though he subsequently reverted to his original position.
After this meeting, PW5 kept in constant touch with Steven, who supplied implements such as false number plates for a van, a crow-bar, a cutter and a few screwdrivers. Steven told PW5 to meet him between 7pm and 8pm at Lorong Ampas. PW5 obtained the vehicle used in the burglary because Steven was unable to do so. However, Steven backed out at the last minute and told them that his cousin, Veera, would take his place. PW5 telephoned the appellant to ask about this, and was told that all would go on as planned, just as Steven had said.
PW5 described in detail the break-in. In a nutshell, PW5, Ramesh, DW2 and Veera made off with a large quantity of coins from the British Club`s jackpot machines. They drove to Jalan Ampas, where DW2`s father worked, and deposited the stolen coins in a small room at the back of the building. Their intention was to wait for Steven`s instructions.
PW5 contacted Steven the next day. Steven said that he would call the appellant and let PW5 know what to do. Later, Steven called and said that he would be there in the evening to help them count the coins. PW5 telephoned the appellant and told him what Steven said. The appellant said that he knew about this and that he would be there as well.
Ramesh and DW2 arrived at about 5pm that evening. The appellant came later in a taxi. However, Steven did not turn up. The four of them started to count the coins but gave up because there were too many. Instead, they packed them in `Ziploc` bags and divided the bags. The appellant took two bags of one dollar coins and told them that Steven would be coming later to collect his and Veera`s share.
The next day, PW5 telephoned the appellant and asked why Steven had not collected the money. The appellant reassured PW5 that nothing would go wrong. The appellant also asked PW5 not to implicate him if something was to go wrong. PW5 agreed. He related this to Ramesh and DW2. They too agreed not to implicate the appellant.
Steven did not collect his money, so PW5 told DW2 and Ramesh that they would set aside Steven`s and Veera`s share, and that they could take theirs. Ramesh was later arrested, apparently because he got into an argument with a taxi-driver. The next day, PW5 was arrested.
The investigating officer gave evidence that Steven is deceased. Steven had been arrested in 1992 but had not been charged for the British Club break-in. It was not possible to ascertain the reason for this, because the investigating officer for that case had also passed away. All that could be said was that Steven had been charged with and was convicted of another offence. A British Club representative testified that the British Club did not have any close-circuit television cameras in September 1992.
 The defence
The appellant`s defence was a denial. His evidence was that there was one occasion before 7 September 1992 when Steven met PW5 at the appellant`s workplace. Steven`s father worked nearby and PW5 used to go to the appellant`s workplace for drinks. The appellant introduced Steven to PW5. The appellant said that he overheard the two of them talking about the British Club when he returned from his rounds. He did not know what the discussion was about.
Sometime around 7 September 1992, the appellant received a call from Steven. Steven asked him to go to a coffee shop at Balestier Road. Steven said that he wanted to talk to the appellant. The appellant asked him what it was about, but Steven said that he could not talk about it over the phone.
The appellant took a taxi to the coffee-shop. Steven and PW5 were there, together with another man whom he could not recall. They had some food and beer. Then the appellant asked Steven why he asked him to go there. Steven and PW5 took him to a small room in a building opposite the coffee-shop. There were coins heaped on the floor. Steven asked the appellant if he could help to change the coins to notes. The appellant replied that they could be changed at the bank and told him not to call the appellant again at his workplace.
The appellant denied instigating PW5 to commit the housebreaking. He denied providing information about the British Club, planning the housebreaking or taking any of the money. He also did not know Ramesh, DW2 or Veera. He did not know why PW5 implicated him.
DW2 had served his sentence for the British Club break-in. He testified that he was never told by PW5 of the appellant`s involvement in the break-in. PW5 had merely told him that PW5, Steven, Ramesh and himself were involved. DW2 did not know Steven until PW5 introduced him to DW2. DW2 did not speak to Steven. PW5 only told him that Steven planned the break-in. PW5 never said anything about the appellant.
DW2 had only seen the appellant once at Lorong Ampas. This was after the break-in. He did not notice whether the appellant took any money when he left. He did not know what was discussed as they were speaking in Tamil. DW2 had not seen the appellant again.
During cross-examination, DW2 confirmed that the agreement was that they would share the money from the break-in equally. He was not sure whether the appellant was involved in counting the coins. The appellant merely volunteered to change the coins. DW2 also explained that he might have said to the investigating officer on 10 June 1996 that the appellant was present and gave information on how to execute the plan for the break-in because it was not clear in his mind who Steven and the appellant were at the time. He had thought that the appellant was Steven and vice versa. It was only in court that he saw that the appellant was not Steven. It had been a very long time since he last saw them.
 The finding below
The district judge was aware that for the purpose of this trial, PW5 was an accomplice. However, the district judge was satisified that PW5 was a truthful witness. He held:
 
When [PW5] testified I observed his demeanour closely particularly during the cross-examination. His account of the facts and surrounding circumstances relating to the break-in at the British Club was clear and consistent. He was unshaken in cross-examination. There was no reason for the court to disbelieve his testimony when he had already served sentence for the British Club break-in and he gained nothing from testifying against the accused. The defence also did not suggest any motive on the part of [PW5] for his testimony.
 
 
 
The district judge was of the view that there was corroboration of PW5`s evidence that the appellant had told him that there was no close-circuit television cameras at the British Club. The district judge accepted PW5`s explanation for implicating the appellant in the Leksun break-in. He held:
 
However [PW5] explained that the mistake was due to a confusion whilst being interrogated. He however promptly rectified his mistake and the accused was not charged in connection with the Leksun robbery. I accepted this as an honest mistake.
 
 
 
The district judge had no difficulty in accepting PW5`s evidence that he was easing his conscience by informing the police about the appellant`s involvement.
On the other hand, the district judge disbelieved the appellant`s evidence. It was difficult for him to believe that Steven and PW5 would hatch a plot to burgle the British Club upon being introduced. It was also difficult for him to believe that the appellant would leave his post and take a taxi at his expense to Jalan Ampas at Steven`s request just to be shown coins and to be consulted on whether the appellant could help to change them into notes. He was of the view that the fact that the appellant rushed down from his place of work showed his involvement in the robbery. Furthermore, DW2 had said that the appellant volunteered to change the coins, whilst the appellant said that he had told them to go to the bank.
As for DW2`s evidence, it did not assist the appellant. That Steven told PW5 of the location of the break-in did not exonerate the appellant from being a planner. In any case, DW2 appeared to the district judge to be a reluctant witness.
In the event, the district judge was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. He convicted the appellant and sentenced him to four years` imprisonment.
 The appeal
For this appeal, I constantly bore in mind the fact that the conviction was based solely on the testimony of PW5, an accomplice. In this context, s 116(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) must be given real effect, and not merely recited. I also kept in mind the fact that PW5 had not in any manner implicated the appellant when he pleaded guilty to the offence in 1992. In addition, he had also wrongly implicated the appellant in the Leksun break-in, which occurred in 1996, before he implicated the appellant in the British Club break-in.
The district judge was of the view that PW5`s testimony was unshaken by cross-examination. With respect to the district judge, it was not altogether clear what the district judge meant by this. If he meant that PW5 had not retracted his evidence, that was obviously too much to ask for. If he meant that PW5`s evidence withstood cross-examination, then I disagreed.
Firstly, PW5 had not given any credible explanation as to why he had wrongly implicated the appellant in the Leksun break-in. His answer was a convenient `I was confused`. There was no explanation proffered as to how and why he was confused. PW5 had just been released from prison after serving terms for, inter alia, the British Club break-in. He was arrested for the Leksun break-in, which occurred some four years later after his release from prison. According to him, he was also being interrogated in relation to seven other charges. However, the fact remained that the Leksun break-in was committed by PW5 the day before his arrest. I was unable to fathom how he could be confused to the extent of accusing the appellant of being involved in it.
The emptiness of PW5`s evidence that he was confused could be compared vividly with DW2`s explanation of how DW2 was confused. DW2 accepted that he might have told the investigating officer in 1996 that the appellant planned the British Club break-in. His explanation of this was cogent. He had only met the appellant once, and that was four years ago. Likewise, he had not seen Steven for four years. He had thought that the appellant was Steven. That was why he corrected himself when he saw in court that the appellant was not Steven. It was a reasonable and acceptable explanation. PW5`s explanation, on the other hand, was bereft of content.
The bareness of PW5`s explanation also raised numerous doubts. Many questions remain unanswered. In what context did PW5 first mention the appellant? How did it come about that he mentioned the appellant? If the interrogation was sufficiently vigorous for PW5 to be so fundamentally confused, how reliable could what he said be?
Contrary to what the district judge said, there did not appear to be any indication at all in the records that the appellant was not charged with the Leksun break-in because PW5 corrected himself. It appeared just as likely that the appellant was not charged because further investigation revealed that the accusation was false. It was a crucial distinction whether PW5 corrected himself, if at all, before or after investigations revealed that the appellant was not involved in the Leksun break-in. The two alternatives would throw very different light on the complexion of the whole case. In the latter scenario, there would be very plausible reasons why PW5 would want to implicate the appellant falsely, namely, that his initial lie was found out. It cannot be over-emphasised that PW5 had wrongly or falsely implicated the appellant on the very day of his arrest.
Secondly, regarding PW5`s reason for implicating the appellant now, some four years later, PW5 said that this was to ease his conscience. With respect to the district judge, considering that PW5 was a person who embarked on a series of housebreaking so soon after his release from prison, his claim of being conscience-stricken sounded empty. PW5`s evidence appeared to be that if he had not been arrested again, he would not have been bothered by his conscience!
I was of the view PW5`s statement that `it is not fair` gave a better insight into the state of his mind at the relevant time. It revealed his desire that the appellant should be imprisoned. As for what was not fair, it may be that it was as the appellant said, that it was because the appellant was never punished even though he was the mastermind of the British Club break-in. On the other hand, it could be anything else. Whatever it was, it seemed that it was only unfair because the appellant was arrested for the Leksun break-in. In my view, it was very dangerous to rely on his testimony.
Thirdly, PW5`s evidence was not wholly consistent. He had said in examination-in-chief that after the appellant instigated him to commit the break-in over the phone, Steven went to PW5`s workplace and they discussed about the planned break-in. Subsequently, they went to the appellant`s workplace where they again discussed the break-in. However, in his cross-examination, PW5 said that the first time he discussed the break-in with Steven was at the appellant`s workplace. This was a material contradiction. This is because PW5`s evidence was that the appellant told PW5 that he would send Steven over to see PW5 to discuss the details of the planned break-in.
More importantly, PW5`s evidence was not consistent at all with DW2`s. In this context, it was highly relevant that DW2 and PW5 were friends. On the other hand, DW2 hardly knew the appellant at all. If it was the case that PW5 had finally decided to bare all about the appellant`s involvement, there was little reason for DW2 to be a `reluctant witness`. If PW5 was to be believed, the reason why DW2 did not implicate the appellant was because PW5 asked him not to. That reason no longer existed.
In any event, considering that the agreement was that the participants share the spoils equally, it seemed highly improbable that PW5 would not have told Rameesh and DW2 that there was an additional person who would be sharing the loot. This would be so no matter how disinterested DW2 could have been in the details of the planned break-in. The contrary position, which even PW5 did not suggest in his evidence, would have bordered on the inherently incredible.
Looked at in this light, DW2`s evidence that the appellant had volunteered to change the coins into notes paled into insignificance compared to his evidence on the bigger picture of his lack of knowledge that the appellant was involved in the break-in. The former was at best a minor inconsistency. The latter was a material contradiction.
Counsel for the defence had, undoubtedly, conceded that DW2`s evidence was neither here nor there. However, bearing in mind what I have said about his evidence, I was of the firm view that this concession was wrongly made. Despite the unsatisfactory state of DW2`s evidence, the major points in his testimony were most telling. The district judge ought to have examined them more carefully.
Lastly, I found it difficult to understand how the British Club representative`s evidence could be corroboration of any part of PW5`s evidence, apart from the fact that PW5 knew that there was no close-circuit television at the club. PW5 could have acquired that knowledge from any person. There was also no explanation as to how the appellant came to know so much about the British Club.
It is settled law that when a trial judge makes a finding of fact based on the credibility of witnesses whom he had the opportunity to see and assess, an appellate court would be most reluctant to disturb the finding. Reference may be made to 
Teo Ai Choo v Leng Sze Hian
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 331
  ; 
[1986] SLR 75
 and 
PP v Victor Rajoo s/o A Pitchay Muthu
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 417
  .
However, it is equally settled law that an impression as to the demeanour of a witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence. This salutory caution was stated by Spenser-Wilkinson J in 
Tara Sing& Ors v PP
 
 
[1949] MLJ 88
  . That case was approved in 
PP v Yeoh Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
  , and by the Court of Appeal in 
 PP v Victor Rajoo 
. Likewise, a finding on a witness`s credibility must be tested against known objective facts and evidence.
For the reasons I have stated, it cannot be said that PW5`s evidence was so compelling that a conviction could be based solely on it. The circumstance in which he came to implicate the appellant was suspect, as was his motive. His evidence was neither consistent, nor did it square with the account given by his accomplice, DW2. In this context, if PW5 had no reason to lie, DW2 had even less reason to do so. There were important gaps in the prosecution`s case. Tested against the whole of his evidence, and the known objective facts and evidence, PW5`s testimony fell far short.
Turning to the appellant`s defence, it is also trite law that an accused should not be convicted merely because his defence is tenuous or because the trial judge disbelieves his defence. Nevertheless, for completeness, I will deal with the district judge`s findings on this. In my view, the district judge appeared to have misconstrued the appellant`s evidence on at least two material instances.
Firstly, it was never the appellant`s evidence that PW5 and Steven hatched a plan to break into the British Club when they first met at the appellant`s workplace. The appellant`s evidence was that he overheard them talking about the British Club. This was a completely different thing from saying that they were discussing how to break into the British Club. No doubt, counsel for the appellant had put to PW5 that PW5 and Steven discussed the British Club break-in on that occasion, but that was hardly the same thing as the appellant`s testimony. By the same token, the prosecuting officer had put to DW2 that DW2, PW5, the appellant, Steven and Ramesh held discussions prior to the British Club break-in, even though it was never PW5`s evidence that such a discussion involving so many persons ever took place before the break-in.
In any event, even if this part of the appellant`s evidence was untrue, and the appellant never overheard them talking about the British Club, it still did not take the prosecution`s case very far. The appellant`s recollection of when the meeting took place was unlikely to be reliable. The appellant was describing an event that took place four years ago.
Secondly, it was not the appellant`s evidence that he took a taxi from work to see Steven just to be asked whether he could change coins into notes. His evidence was that Steven asked him to meet him and that it concerned something that should not be discussed over the phone. It seemed to me that to any reasonable person, this amounted to saying that it was something important, which would have justified the appellant leaving work and taking a taxi to meet Steven. Likewise, I was unable to see anything peculiar about Steven`s request that the appellant meet him.
In addition, there was hardly any reason for the appellant to have rushed down to the coffee shop if what PW5 said was true. The break-in had occurred the previous night, and according to PW5, the appellant was informed the following morning. The appellant only went to the coffee shop near Jalan Ampas in the evening.
In conclusion, even though I did not have the benefit of assessing PW5`s demeanor, I was satisfied that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction. The conviction was unsafe. Accordingly, I allowed the appellant`s appeal.",1997-05-16 00:00:00,SG High Court

The appellant in this case was convicted in the district court of an amended charge of cheating which ran as follows:

NRIC NO S 0182215B
 
 
 
are charged that you, on a day in the month of June 1995, at City Plaza, Tg Katong Road, did cheat one Han Boon Juan, to wit, by deceiving the said Han Boon Juan to believe that you own a fuel bunkering company and he would be able to make $4,000 profit by investing in the said business and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Han Boon Juan to hand over to you cash $8,000 as an investment, which the said Han Boon Juan would not have done, had he not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Upon his conviction, the appellant was sentenced to five months` imprisonment. He appealed against both conviction and sentence. This appeal came up for hearing before me on 2 May 1997. Having heard the submissions of both counsel for the appellant and the deputy public prosecutor, and having read their detailed written submissions, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons in writing.
 The brief facts
By way of background to the case, it should be explained that the appellant and the complainant Han Boon Juan (PW1) were casual acquaintances who first met each other during a holiday tour in Australia. Apart from this single undisputed fact, the version of events given by the appellant in the trial below differed drastically from the evidence of the main prosecution witnesses, PW1 and his friend Wong Kum Cheong (PW2). I set out below a short summary of the two versions of events presented to the district judge.
The prosecution`s case was that the appellant had told PW1 he owned a fuel bunkering company and that he had persuaded PW1 to make an investment of $8,000 in this company, promising in return a $4,000 profit within 2 weeks. PW1 in turn persuaded his friend PW2 to join in the said $8,000 investment and cash amounting to this sum was handed over to the appellant by PW1 sometime in June 1995. Three cheques were given by the appellant to PW1 and PW2 in succession. All three cheques were postdated and pre-signed by someone other than the appellant. Each of the three cheques was made out for an amount other than the $12,000 ($8,000 capital and $4,000 profit) promised by the appellant: the first (exh P2) was made out for a sum of $18,000, the second (exh P3) for $2,000 and the last (exh P5) for $5,000. Each cheque was dishonoured when presented for payment on the due date. Both PW1 and PW2 became increasingly frustrated with the appellant and PW1 eventually made a police report. The appellant contacted them again in June 1996, however, and paid them $8,000 in an attempt to `
 settle 
` the matter. On the appellant`s request, PW1 and PW2 signed a note which the appellant had drafted, acknowledging receipt of the said $8,000 and stating that he no longer owed them any moneys (exh D1).
The appellant, for his part, denied the above account of events. He asserted that he knew nothing about the fuel bunkering business and that he had never told PW1 he owned such a business. He claimed, instead, that both PW1 and PW2 were illegal moneylenders who had lent him money after he `
 jokingly 
` asked PW1 for a loan during a casual conversation. The loan, he said, had actually been for a sum of $20,000 but only $18,000 in cash had been given to him because $2,000 was first deducted as `
 interest 
`. The three cheques given by him to PW1 and PW2 were merely unsuccessful efforts on his part to repay the loan. He claimed that in all, he paid the two men various sums of money amounting to $21,000 during the period between July 1995 and June 1996. The last payment was the cash payment of $8,000 in June 1996.
A detailed description of the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses and by the appellant in his own defence can be found in the district judge`s grounds of decision.
 The appeal
There were no substantive legal issues raised in the appeal.
 The appeal against conviction
In respect of the appeal against conviction, the appellant contended that the district judge should have disbelieved the evidence of the prosecution witnesses; in particular, that the district judge should have made a finding of `no case to answer` at the close of the prosecution case; further, or in the alternative, that she should have given the appellant the `
 benefit of the doubt 
` at the conclusion of the trial.

The thrust of counsel`s arguments was, simply, that the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses was `
 inherently incredible 
`. This was an argument first raised by counsel at the close of the prosecution case in the court below. From a perusal of the notes of evidence, counsel apparently relied on the following grounds: (a). In respect of PW1, counsel argued that as a businessman dealing in ship repairs, he could not have been so `` as to part with $8,000 cash on the strength of a promise of $4,000 profit within two weeks.
 (b). As to PW2, it was incredible that he should have agreed to invest money in a company owned by someone he had not met.
 (c). As to some of the other prosecution witnesses, counsel submitted that there were `` between their evidence and PW1`s. In respect of PW3, he had said that the lunch with the appellant took place sometime in ``. PW1, in contrast, had said that this lunch took place sometime during mid to late June 1995. Counsel submitted that the lunch could not possibly have taken place in July 1995: the cheque P1 was dishonoured on 1 July 1995 and there could not have been any reason for PW3 to meet the appellant over lunch after that date.
 (d). In respect of PW4, he had said that he met the appellant for lunch after PW1 asked him (PW4) to consider investing $4,000 in the appellant`s fuel bunkering business. Counsel submitted that this was incredible evidence because PW1 and PW2 had, on their own evidence, already invested $8,000 in the appellant`s business by then: there was, according to counsel, `` for the appellant to solicit further investments from PW4.
 
 
The district judge rejected the above arguments. Her reasons for doing so are set out succinctly at pp 16-17 of her grounds of decision and I shall not reproduce them in these written grounds.
At the conclusion of the trial, defence counsel reiterated the argument that the prosecution evidence was `
 inherently incredible 
` and urged the court to find, instead, that the parties had engaged in an illegal moneylending transaction. These submissions were again rejected by the district judge. She held that the prosecution witnesses had been `
 truthful 
` and `
 straightforward 
`. She preferred their evidence to that of the appellant whose testimony she described as being `
 glib 
`, `
 riddled with inconsistencies and improbabilities 
` and `
 contradicted by the conduct of the parties and the other evidence 
`. Her evaluation of the evidence is set out at pp 20-39 of the grounds of decision. She dealt with the evidence of each witness (including the appellant) clearly and painstakingly; and again, I do not propose to reproduce or paraphrase her findings in these written grounds. The reasons which she relied on for accepting the prosecution`s version of events and rejecting the appellant`s were logical, elegantly articulated and amply supported by documentary and other factual evidence. There were, in my view, no grounds on which her findings could be faulted, particularly bearing in mind the advantage she enjoyed in being able to observe at first hand the demeanor of each witness.
 The appeal against sentence
In respect of his sentence of five months` imprisonment, the appellant complained on appeal that this was manifestly excessive.
Prior to sentence being passed in the court below, the appellant`s antecedents were made known to the district judge. He had two previous convictions for offences under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed): an offence under s 67(1) of driving whilst under the influence of drink or drugs; and an offence under s 63(1) of speeding. Both offences were committed on the same day. In respect of the first offence, he was fined $2,500 and disqualified for 18 months from driving all classes of vehicles. In respect of the second offence, he was fined $500. In making a mitigation plea on the appellant`s behalf, however, counsel pointed out to the district judge that the present case constituted the appellant`s first conviction for an offence involving dishonesty. Counsel also submitted that consideration should be given to the fact that the appellant had - on the evidence of PW1 and PW2 - repaid the duo a total of $9,000 ($1,000 cash to PW2 sometime in July 1995; $8,000 cash to PW1 and PW2 in June 1996).
The above factors were carefully considered by the district judge in her grounds of decision. Bearing in mind the maximum custodial sentence of seven years prescribed for the offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and taking into account all the circumstances of the case, I was of the view that the sentence of five months which she eventually imposed could not in any way be considered manifestly excessive. It should be pointed out that the district judge expressly noted the element of premeditation present in the appellant`s scheme: he told the story of his fuel bunkering business not only to PW1 but also to PW2, PW3 and PW4; he consistently refused to give any business cards to PW2, PW3 and PW4 even when asked; he ensured that all three cheques given by him to PW1 and PW2 were drawn on a third party`s bank account; and none of these three cheques were ever made out for the total sum of $12,000 promised to PW1 and PW2.
Moreover, in spite of the monetary restitution made, the appellant showed no remorse whatsoever: he accused PW1 and PW2 of being unscrupulous moneylenders; he attempted to insinuate that PW3 and PW4 were in cahoots with PW1 and PW2; and, whilst in the witness stand, he made lengthy submissions castigating the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.
I should also point out that in comparison with the sentences imposed in other cases of cheating, the sentence of five months` imprisonment in the appellant`s case was not a heavy one. In considering the appeal, I had occasion to review a range of previous sentencing decisions in cheating cases and I set out below four examples of such cases.
In 
 Thevamani Ramasamy v PP 
 (DAC 15238/93, 15230/93 and 15244/93) the accused was convicted in the district court of three charges of cheating. He dishonestly induced the complainant to part with a sum of $1,000, another sum of $3,985 and jewellery valued at over $33,000, by deceiving her into believing that these payments were necessary for prayers and ceremonies designed to free her from bad luck. He was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment on the first charge; three months` imprisonment on the second charge; and eight months` imprisonment on the third charge. All three sentences were ordered to run consecutively. The accused`s appeal against both conviction and sentence was dismissed by the High Court.
In 
 PP v Lee Choon Chee 
 (DAC 17045/94) the accused was convicted of a charge of cheating: he dishonestly induced the complainant to hand over $300 in cash by deceiving the complainant into believing that a cheque would be given in return for the cash. The accused, who had five previous convictions for cheating, was sentenced to eight years` preventive detention. He appealed against both conviction and sentence, but subsequently withdrew his appeal.
In 
 PP v Edward Lekwachi Cox 
 (DAC 10422/93, 10423/93 and 10424/93) the accused pleaded guilty to three charges of engaging with another to conspire to cheat: in pursuance of that conspiracy, the accused deceived a vendor into releasing certain goods to him by dishonestly presenting a Mastercard for payment and deceiving the vendor into believing that the said card was genuine. The goods in question comprised a suit valued at $350, two pairs of trousers valued at $280 and a jacket valued at $200. The accused had no antecedents. He was sentenced to 12 months` imprisonment on each charge. In respect of another charge of fraudulent possession of goods to which he also pleaded guilty, he was sentenced to six months` imprisonment; and this was ordered to run consecutively to the sentences imposed on the three cheating charges. The accused`s appeal was dismissed by the High Court which enhanced the sentence on each cheating charge to two years` imprisonment. The court further ordered that the two-year sentence on the first of these cheating charges was to run consecutively to the six-month sentence on the possession charge, but concurrently with the sentences on the other two cheating charges.
In 
Kua Hoon Chua v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
  , the accused pleaded guilty in the district court to a charge of cheating: he deceived his brother-in-law into believing that he (the accused) was in a position to start a joint venture business, which deception induced his brother-in-law to part with $20,000. The accused, who had two previous convictions for cheating, was sentenced to five years` corrective training. His appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court.
 Conclusion
In the light of the reasons set out above, I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against both conviction and sentence.",1997-05-12 00:00:00,SG High Court

In or about June 1990, the plaintiff felt some lumps in her abdomen. She consulted an outpatient polyclinic and was referred to the first defendant`s hospital for further consultation.
In August 1990 an ultrasound was carried out on the plaintiff`s abdomen. She was then advised that she would have to undergo an operation to remove a tumour in her ovaries.
On or about 6 September 1990, an operation to remove the right ovary was carried out by Dr BL Tay, a servant or agent of the first defendant. During the operation the cancerous mass was accidentally ruptured with spillage of the cancerous fluid into the plaintiff`s abdominal cavity. The plaintiff was advised that this exposed her to increased risk of recurrence of ovarian cancer if she did not undergo chemotherapy. She accepted this advice and was given chemotherapy treatment on or about 25 December 1990 after assessment by Dr Goh Chee Leok, a servant or agent of the first defendant .
On or about 7 January 1991, the plaintiff developed severe toxicity to the drugs administered in the chemotherapy treatment and had high fever and sore throat.
On or about 11 January 1991, the plaintiff sought treatment at the second defendant`s hospital for her throat infection. On the same day she was admitted to the first defendant`s hospital and warded at its Intensive Care Unit for severe tonsillitis and leucopenia.
On 11 January 1991 at the first defendant`s hospital, the plaintiff was treated with a drip injected on her right palm. The drip was administered at the same spot for the next few days. On or about 15 January 1991 her right hand was swollen and painful. Despite her frequent complaints to the doctors and other staff of the first defendant, no action was taken to alleviate the swell and the pain.
On or about 16 January 1991, at the first defendant`s hospital the needle inserted on 11 January 1991 and left in situ since was removed. The plaintiff was then sent to the second defendant`s hospital for treatment for her tonsillitis. After the treatment, she was sent back to the first defendant`s hospital where she was again put on drip on the right arm, this time between the elbow and the wrist.
From 20 January 1991, the plaintiff developed high fever again. She complained of pain on her right hand. On 28 January 1991, she was transferred to the second defendant`s hospital where minor surgery by way of incision and drainage of the site at her right hand was performed. A drip was then administered on her left hand by the staff of the second defendant . Blisters then developed on her right hand.
On 1 February 1991, the plaintiff was transferred to the Department of Hand Surgery of the third defendant`s hospital for further management of the right hand infection and severe marrow depression and ovarian cancer.
On 9 February 1991, at the third defendant`s hospital, because of the infection, the plaintiff`s right hand was amputated at the forearm level. This did not stop further infection and another amputation, this time above the elbow, was performed on 8 March 1991. The plaintiff was eventually discharged from the third defendant`s hospital on 22 March 1991.
After her discharge from further medical treatment, she consulted the Legal Aid Bureau (`LAB`). LAB wrote to the three defendants for reports on the plaintiff`s injury and treatment and enquiring if the amputation could have been avoided. The replies dating from June 1991 to 30 September 1992 dealt with the medical history and treatment given at each of the three hospitals leading to the amputation. But they did not give the cause of the infection that gave rise to the need for amputation.
On 8 December 1992 LAB sought the opinion of Professor Robert WH Pho (`Prof Pho`), Professor in Orthopaedic Surgery, National University of Singapore. Prof Pho advised on 15 February 1993 as follows:
 
Madam Tan Yang Chai
 
 
 
I refer to your letters dated 8 December 1992 and 2 February 1993 on the above patient.
 
 
 
I noted that this patient was admitted in August to Kandang Kerbau Hospital for ovarian cancer. Post-operative chemotherapy was given. She developed infection of the right hand which spread to involve the proximal forearn [sic] and an above elbow amputation was performed on 8 March 1991.
 
 
 
The following are my comments:
 
 
 
 
1 It is not uncommon to see patients who have received chemotherapy which lower their immune response and therefore make them susceptible to infection. 
 
2 It is not uncommon that once infection developed in immune-compromised patient it would be difficult to control the infection despite adequate debridement and appropriate antibiotic treatment. 
 
3 From the information you enclosed, it was noted that once the infection was noted this patient was then transferred to the care of Dr Teoh Lam Chuan who is an experienced hand surgeon at Singapore General Hospital. It was noted the patient was seen in consultation with the bacteriologist Dr David Allen. Despite this, the infection continued to spread up the arm. A second opinion from Dr Tan Chong Tien, orthopaedic surgeon was sought on 16 February 1991 and both Dr Teoh and Dr Tan agreed that it would be in the best interest of the patient that an above elbow amputation be carried out and this was performed on 8 March 1991. Following amputation the wound slowly healed and they were able to save the patient`s life. Patient responded to hyperalimentations and recovered.
  
 
 
From the enclosed information, I am unable to make any comments regarding negligence/misconduct on the part of any doctors or medical institutions.
 
 
 
On 7 February 1994, the solicitors assigned by LAB to act for the plaintiff filed Suit No 180 of 1994 against the third defendant. That writ was never served but was allowed to lapse.
In the meantime on 31 March 1994, the plaintiff`s solicitors received the advice of Dr Teo Wee Sin, a surgeon practising in Kuala Lumpur. His advice read:
 
Re: Mdm Tan Yang Chai
 
 
 
Thank you for your letter dated 6 January 1994 and the various medical reports on the above named patient.
 
 
 
It appeared to me the infection in the right hand and subsequently the right upper limb was caused by the needle insertion in her right hand. The medical reports seem to indicate that all proper care and attention had been exercised `after the infection was detected`. Hence, it appeared to me that if adequate care had been taken while the patient was on a drip, there will be no infection.
 
 
 
The next question will be how do we define `adequate care`. Insertion of a needle including the technique, the experience of the personnel, the type of intravenous solution and the type and frequency of injecting the intravenous drugs directly into the vein or through the intravenous solution will have to be carefully analysed before any negligence can be established.
 
 
 
On 24 May 1994, Dr Teo Wee Sin reverted further as follows:
 
Re: Medical Report on Mdm Tan Yang Chai
 
 
 
Thank you for your letter dated 4 April 1994.
 
 
 
This is to confirm that:
 
 
 
 
(1) The infection in the right hand was caused by the needle insertion. 
 
(2) The needle insertion was probably done adequately and the infection was introduced after the needle was left in situ in the right hand. 
 
(3) Adequate care will include the regular inspection of the needle insertion site, the care in changing the intravenous solutions running through the needle and the length of time that the needle was left in situ in the right hand.
  
 
 
On 3 July 1995, the plaintiff`s solicitors filed and served the present proceedings for damages for negligence on the part of the defendants jointly and or severally resulting in the loss of her right arm.
On 25 October 1995, the second defendant obtained an order that the proceedings against it be struck out on the ground that at the material time, Tan Tock Seng Hospital was managed, controlled and administered by the Ministry of Health and not by the second defendant .
In the meantime, on 28 August 1996, the first and third defendant (`the remaining defendants`) filed an application under O 18 r 19 and or under the inherent jurisdiction of the court for an order that the statement of claim be struck out on the ground that the claim was statute-barred under the Limitation Act (Cap 163) s 24A(2)(b) as the plaintiff had the knowledge required for bringing the action by the latest 8 March 1991. They relied on sub-ss (4) and (6) of s 24A.
Order in terms of the remaining defendants` application was granted by the senior assistant registrar. The plaintiff appealed. I allowed the appeal. The remaining defendants have appealed to the Court of Appeal. I now give my reasons.
It was the plaintiff`s contention that the earliest date on which she had the knowledge required for bringing the action under s 24A was 31 March 1994 when her solicitors received the advice of Dr Teo Wee Sin. Section 24A reads:
 
 
(1) This section shall apply to any action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract or of a provision made by or under any written law or independently of any contract or any such provision). 
 
(2) An action to which this section applies, where the damages claimed consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any other person, shall not be brought after the expiration of - 
 
(a) 3 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or 
 
(b) 3 years from the earliest date on which the plaintiff has the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury, if that period expires later than the period mentioned in paragraph (a). 
 
(3) An action to which this section applies, other than one referred to in subsection (2), shall not be brought after the expiration of the period of - 
 
(a) 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or 
 
(b) 3 years from the earliest date on which the plaintiff or any person in whom the cause of action was vested before him first had both the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damage and a right to bring such an action, if that period expires later than the period mentioned in paragraph (a). 
 
(4) In subsections (2) and (3), the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury or damage (as the case may be) means knowledge - 
 
(a) that the injury or damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence, nuisance or breach of duty; 
 
(b) of the identity of the defendant; 
 
(c) if it is alleged that the act or omission was that of a person other than the defendant, of the identity of that person and the additional facts supporting the bringing of an action against the defendant; and 
 
(d) of material facts about the injury or damage which would lead a reasonable person who had suffered such injury or damage to consider it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgment. 
 
(5) Knowledge that any act or omission did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence, nuisance or breach of duty is irrelevant for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3). 
 
(6) For the purposes of this section, a person`s knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire - 
 
(a) from facts observable or ascertainable by him; or 
 
(b) from facts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek. 
 
(7) A person shall not be taken by virtue of subsection (6) to have knowledge of a fact ascertainable only with the help of expert advice so long as he has taken all reasonable steps to obtain (and, where appropriate, to act on) that advice.
  
 
 
Section 24A of our Limitation Act is in pari materia with s 11 read with s 14 of the English Limitation Act (`English Act`). Section 11 of the English Act reads:
 
 
(1) This section applies to any action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract or of provision made by or under a statute or independently of any contract or any such provision) where the damages claimed by the plaintiff for the negligence, nuisance or breach of duty consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any other person. 
 
(2) None of the time limits given in the preceding provisions of this Act shall apply to an action to which this section applies. 
 
(3) An action to which this section applies shall not be brought after the expiration of the period applicable in accordance with subsection (4) or (5) below. 
 
(4) Except where subsection (5) below applies, the period applicable is three years from - 
 
(a) the date on which the cause of action accrued; or 
 
(b) the date of knowledge (if later) of the person injured. 
 
(5) If the person injured dies before the expiration of the period mentioned in subsection (4) above, the period applicable as respects the cause of action surviving for the benefit of his estate by virtue of section 1 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 shall be three years from - 
 
(a) the date of death; or 
 
(b) the date of the personal representative`s knowledge; 
 
whichever is the later. 
 
(6) For the purposes of this section `personal representative` includes any person who is or has been a personal representative of the deceased, including an executor who has not proved the will (whether or not he has renounced probate) but not anyone appointed only as a special personal representative in relation to settled land; and regard shall be had to any knowledge acquired by any such person while a personal representative or previously. 
 
(7) If there is more than one personal representative, and their dates of knowledge are different, subsection (5)(b) above shall be read as referring to the earliest of those dates.
  
 
 
Section 14 of the English Act reads:
 
 
(1) In sections 11 and 12 of this Act references to a person`s date of knowledge are references to the date on which he first had knowledge of the following facts - 
 
(a) that the injury in question was significant; and 
 
(b) that the injury was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence, nuisance or breach of duty; and 
 
(c) the identity of the defendant; and 
 
(d) if it is alleged that the act or omission was that of a person other than the defendant, the identity of that person and the additional facts supporting the bringing of an action against the defendant; 
 
and knowledge that any acts or omissions did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence, nuisance or breach of duty is irrelevant. 
 
(2) For the purposes of this section an injury is significant if the person whose date of knowledge is in question would reasonably have considered it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgment. 
 
(3) For the purposes of this section a person`s knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire - 
 
(a) from facts observable or ascertainable by him; or 
 
(b) from facts ascertainable by him with the help of medical or other appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek; 
 
but a person shall not be fixed under this subsection with knowledge of a fact ascertainable only with the help of expert advice so long as he has taken all reasonable steps to obtain (and, where appropriate, to act on) that advice.
  
 
 
The law on s 14(1) of the English Act has been aptly summarised by Michael A Jones on 
Medical Negligence
 
[1996] pp 499
 -500:
 
By s 14(1) references to a person`s date of knowledge are references to the date on which he first had knowledge of the following facts:
 
 
 
 
`(a) that the injury in question was significant; and 
 
(b) that the injury was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence, nuisance or breach of duty; and 
 
(c) the identity of the defendant; and 
 
(d) if it is alleged that the act or omission was that of a person other than the defendant, the identity of that person and the additional facts supporting the bringing of an action against the defendant ...`
  
 
 
These provisions are conjunctive: if the plaintiff does not have the knowledge specified in any of these paragraphs then he does not have `knowledge` for the purpose of starting the limitation period running (though para (d) only applies in certain circumstances). On the other hand, s 14(1) is also exhaustive: no knowledge of any further facts is required.
 
 
 
On knowledge required under ss 11 and 14, Bingham MR (as he was then) in 
Dobbie v Medway Health Authority
 
[1994] 4 All ER 450
 at p 455; [1994] 20 BMLR 61 at pp 65-66 stated:
 
The effect of ss 11(4)(b) and 14(1)(a) is to postpone the running of time until the claimant has knowledge of the personal injury on which he seeks to found his claim. That is `the injury in question`. The word `knowledge` should be given its natural meaning ( 
Davis v Ministry of Defence
 
[1985] CA Transcript 413
 ). As Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR said in 
Halford v Brookes
 
[1991] 3 All ER 559
 at 573, 
[1991] 1 WLR 428
 at 443:
 
 
 
`In this context ""knowledge"" clearly does not mean ""know for certain and beyond possibility of contradictions"". It does, however, mean ""know with sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ, such as submitting a claim to the proposed defendant, taking legal and other advice and collecting evidence.`""
 
 
 
This test is not in my judgment hard to apply. It involves ascertaining the personal injury on which the claim is founded and asking when the claimant knew of it. In the case of an insidious disease or a delayed result of a surgical mishap, this knowledge may come well after the suffering of the disease or the performance of the surgery. But more usually the claimant shows that he has suffered personal injury as soon or almost as soon as he does so.
 
 
 
Time does not begin to run against a claimant until he knows that the personal injury on which he founds his claim is significant within the definition in s 14(2). That gives rise to no issue in this appeal.
 
 
 
The effect of ss 11(4)(b) and 14(1)(b) is to postpone the running of time until the claimant has knowledge that the personal injury on which he founds his claim was wholly or partly attributable to the act or omission of the defendant on which his claim in negligence is founded. `Attributable to` was construed by May LJ in 
 Davis
 to mean `capable of being attributed to` and not `caused by`, and I see no reason to question that conclusion. It cannot plausibly be suggested that the words `act or omission` import any requirement that such act or omission should be actionable or tortious, since that would stultify the closing words of s 14(1) and would moreover flout the recommendation on which the legislation was admittedly founded. In 
Wilkinson v Ancliff (BLT Limited)
 
[1986] 3 All ER 427
 at 436, 
[1986] 1 WLR 1352
 at 1362 reference was made to a submission of counsel based on the use of the words `act or omission` rather than `conduct` in s 14(1)(b). I do not understand the court to have accepted that submission. But it is customary in discussing tortious liability to refer to acts and omissions, and I do not think the meaning of s 14(1)(b) would be any different had the reference been to conduct. Time starts to run against the claimant when he knows that the personal injury on which he founds his claim is capable of being attributed to something done or not done by the defendant whom he wishes to sue. This condition is not satisfied where a man knows that he has a disabling cough or shortness of breath but does not know that his injured condition has anything to do with his working conditions. It is satisfied when he knows that his injured condition is capable of being attributed to his working conditions, even though he has no inkling that his employer may have been at fault.
 
 
 
Knowledge would include constructive knowledge in circumstances falling under our s 24A(6) which is almost identical to s 14(3) of the English Act.
The remaining defendants contended that in view of the plaintiff`s experiences in the hospitals recounted in the statement of claim herein, she must have known without having to rely on expert medical opinion by 8 March 1991 that her amputation was attributable to her medical treatment. On this, I find the dicta of Purchas LJ in 
Nash & Ors v Eli Lilly & Co & Ors
 
[1993] 4 All ER 383
 at p 395; [1992] 14 BMLR 1 at p 12 helpful:
 
... whether a claimant has knowledge depends both upon the information he has received and upon what he makes of it. If it appears that a claimant, while believing that his injury is attributable to the act or omission of the defendant, realises that his belief requires expert confirmation before he acquires such a degree of certainty of belief as amounts to knowledge then he will not have knowledge until that confirmation is obtained.
 
 
 
Did the plaintiff have the requisite knowledge that the infection in her arm was attributable to the insertion of the needle which was then left in situ for five days, and not to inherent risk of chemotherapy? This is a question of fact.
In 
 Davis v Ministry of Defence 
 reported in 
 The Times 
 of 7 August 1985, the plaintiff was employed by the defendant between 1955 and 1971. Up to 1969 he worked as a welder. At that time he contracted a localised attack of dermatitis. He suffered further similar outbreaks between then and August 1971 when he had a serious generalised outbreak and left the defendant`s employment. The plaintiff`s general practitioner had always held the view that the skin condition was due to contact with dust at the plaintiff`s place of work. The plaintiff issued a writ on 29 October 1973. That writ was never served and it lapsed. On 10 November 1981, a fresh writ was issued. The statement of claim served on 8 June 1982 included a plea that prior to 10 November 1978 the plaintiff was unaware that the general outbreak and his subsequent symptoms were attributable to the defendant`s previously pleaded negligence and or breach of statutory duty and that in consequence the claim was not statute-barred by virtue of s 11(4)(b) of the English Act. A defence was served contending that the claim was statute-barred. The defendant then applied to have the action struck out under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The application was dismissed by the Master whose decision was reversed by the judge on appeal. The plaintiff thereupon appealed to the Court of Appeal. The report on the judgment of May LJ (with whom Sir Edward Eveleigh agreed) in allowing the appeal read:
 
The pertinent question was `upon what date did the plaintiff first know that his dermatitis was attributable in whole or in part to his employers` failure to provide him with safe working conditions`?
 
 
 
Although in one context `attributable` could be synonymous with `caused by`, that was not its principal meaning. Section 14(1) (b) required one to ask when the plaintiff first knew that his dermatitis was capable of being attributed to his working conditions with the defendants between 1955 and 1969, bearing in mind that by s 14(3)(b) the plaintiff was deemed to know facts which he could ascertain from expert medical or legal advice which it was reasonable for him to seek. As the defendants` application was summarily to strike out the action in limine the court should only accede to it if the answer to the above question was clear and obvious and the contrary unarguable.
 
 
 
Although counsel for the plaintiff did try to define `knowledge` his Lordship thought that the court should decline to do so. `Knowledge` was an ordinary English word with a clear meaning to which one must give full effect: `reasonable belief` or `suspicion` was not enough.
 
 
 
From the plaintiff`s affidavit alone it would not be difficult to reach the conclusion that he did know that his symptoms were capable of being attributable to his conditions at work. But his affidavit went on to relate that his solicitors had obtained various medical reports and had taken counsel`s opinion twice.
 
 
 
In the result the plaintiff was advised and accepted that there were no reasonable grounds for his continuing his original claim.
 
 
 
The plaintiff had always believed that his dermatitis was due to his employers` fault and that he had a good claim against them.
 
 
 
However, it was clear that he was advised that he did not, and the combined state of mind of the plaintiff himself, as a layman, and that of his medical and legal advisers, which must be attributed to him by s 14(3), could not so surely be said to have been such that he and they knew, prior to 10 November 1978, that it was capable of being attributed to the plaintiff`s working conditions.
 
 
 
It was at least well arguable that the view of the plaintiff`s medical and legal advisers in the early 1970s was that his dermatitis could not be so attributed, but was constitutional.
 
 
 
It would be wrong to take the draconian step in striking out the plaintiff`s claim at this stage and that appeal would be allowed.
 
 
 
Turning now to the pleaded facts in the statement of claim before this court, there is clear evidence that the plaintiff was advised of the cause of the infection giving rise to the amputation of her right forearm on 31 March 1994. Whether she had the requisite knowledge by 8 March 1991 that the infection was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence or breach of duty on the part of the remaining defendants remains a disputed question of fact. The answer to this question contended for on behalf of the remaining defendants is not `clear and obvious and the contrary unarguable`. It would therefore be too draconian to strike out the plaintiff`s action on an application under O 18 r 19 or under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. Accordingly I allowed the appeal with costs reserved leaving the issue of limitation to be decided by the trial judge.",1997-04-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

Whether sentence manifestly excessive
 
The petitioner sought revision of his conviction and also appealed against the sentence imposed. Both the application for revision and the appeal were dismissed. I now set out my reasons for dismissing them.
The petitioner pleaded guilty to a charge of committing theft of seven pieces of children`s clothes, and was fined $1,000, two weeks` imprisonment in default. The charge was in the following terms:
 
You, Packir Malim Bava Fahurudeen Malim, Foreign Identification No F7908704K, are charged that you, on or about 28 February 1997 at or about 8.29pm at No 3 New Bugis Street, at stall no 43, did commit theft of the following items:
 
 
 
a) seven pieces of Chinese clothings valued at a total of $120 (one hundred and twenty dollars) from the said stall belonging to Tian Kian Poh, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The plea of guilt was made to an agreed statement of facts. In summary, it stated that on 28 February 1997, at about 8.29pm, the complainant had called the police telling them that he had detained a male Indian who had allegedly stolen some Chinese costumes from his stall. A witness, a helper at the stall, had seen the petitioner behaving suspiciously at some displays outside the stall, and had decided to keep an eye on the petitioner. The witness saw the petitioner put away some costumes into a bag carried by him, after which the petitioner walked off; the witness alerted the complainant, who gave chase and managed to detain the petitioner at a bus stop nearby. The petitioner was subsequently arrested.
He was brought to court eventually. The notes of evidence of the proceedings are reproduced in their entirety:
 
[Police prosecutor]
 
 
 
Accused in person
 
 
 
Charge marked `P1` read, explained and understood in Tamil.
 
 
 
Pleads guilty. Understands nature and consequences of plea (punishment provided by law explained).
 
 
 
Statement of Facts marked `A` read and admitted without qualification.
 
 
 
 
Court: Guilty and convicted on the charge. 
 
Prosecutor: Nothing known. 
 
Accused: Please impose a fine. That is all. 
 
Court: Fine $1,000, in default, two weeks` imprisonment. 
 
Exhibits to be returned to the owner.
  
 
 
The magistrate was informed that the petitioner had no antecedents. In mitigation, all that the petitioner prayed for was that only a fine be imposed. The magistrate in her sentencing, noted that the petitioner was a first offender and that there were no aggravating factors. It was found by her that no relevant mitigation was raised by the petitioner.
 The petition and the appeal
The petitioner sought appeal and revision, claiming that he was coerced into pleading guilty. It was alleged that he had been intimidated, threatened and assaulted by police officers into admitting the theft. He admitted to the charge in court only because he wanted to get the matter over with and avoid further assault. The petitioner allegedly did not understand the nature and consequences of a plea of guilt; he did not know that he was liable to be deported. Though the petitioner tried to explain to the interpreter his version of events, before pleading guilty, this was not made known by the court interpreter to the magistrate. In support of his contentions, the petitioner listed out various reasons why he himself could not have committed the theft; the version of events relied upon by the prosecution was not credible. The petitioner also took issue with supposed inaccuracies in the statement of facts such as the description of the stall and the items stolen. It was submitted by his counsel that these inaccuracies should have negatived any plea entered by the petitioner and the conviction was wrong: 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
  and 
Vijayaratnam v PP
 
 
[1962] MLJ 106
 [cited] . The fact that the petitioner was not represented and that he was not allowed to contact his employer qualified his admission: 
Sau Soo Kim v PP
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 134
  . Furthermore, at the time of his plea of guilt, the petitioner suffered from a misconception of law.
 The issues
The following issues thus fell to be determined: (I). the grounds for the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction of the court;
 (II). whether such grounds exist here; and
 (III). what orders should be made.
 
 
 
 The grounds for the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction
 
Revision is governed by s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). The revisionary powers of the court are exercised sparingly. In 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
  , it was noted:
 
... various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision which strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
 
 
 
 
 The existence of grounds for revision
 
The petitioner in attempting to make out his case for revision faced a great difficulty. In his allegations of assault and intimidation, he relied on facts not disclosed in the record or in the exhibits. These facts were untested, and no attempt was made to apply to adduce fresh evidence. In these circumstances, it was difficult to accept any of these allegations. The petitioner also claimed that his attempted explanation of the facts to the magistrate was not interpreted by the court interpreter. Obviously nothing on this had been put on record before the present hearing. The court was left with the petitioner`s allegations on the one hand and an affidavit deposed by the interpreter on the other. Again, it was difficult to accept the petitioner`s version.
That left then the inadequacies of the plea of guilt and the statement of facts. The petitioner firstly relied upon the Malaysian case of 
Sau Soo Kim v PP
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 134
  . There Lee Hun Hoe CJ said at pp 135-136:
 
Encik Lamin drew the attention of the court to the proviso of s 50(2) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964. This makes clear that where an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted on his own plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence. Where an accused, as in the case of the appellant, is legally represented at trial the proviso should be adhered to strictly. But, where an accused person is not represented by counsel at the trial then perhaps an appellate court should peruse the record of the trial carefully to satisfy itself that there is no irregularity giving rise to miscarriage of justice. Being unrepresented he would not have the benefit of legal advice. It is thus proper for an appellate court in such a situation to correct miscarriage of justice arising form misconception of law, irregularity of procedure or apparent harshness of treatment resulting in injury or undue hardship to such an accused. For example, if an accused pleaded guilty to a charge which creates no offence known to law and further the facts also disclose no offence, clearly such a conviction should not be allowed to stand. Surely, such a plea of guilty to what is not an offence is no plea at all.
 
 
 
Upon this statement, petitioner`s counsel submitted that as the petitioner was not represented and he was allegedly refused contact with his employer, the plea he made could not be said to be without qualification.
Lee Hun Hoe CJ`s dicta concerning an unrepresented accused does not support that contention at all. All that the judge was concerned with was that the court should be careful to ensure that the plea was correctly made. But the judge cannot be understood to be saying that pleas by unrepresented persons are more easily vitiated than by those represented. The learned judge gave the example of a plea to an unrecognised offence as not being a real plea - such a plea would be bad whether the accused is represented or not. The acceptance of the petitioner`s submission would in practical terms mean that no plea by an unrepresented person could ever be accepted as unqualified. This cannot be.
The need to ensure that a plea of guilt is properly made was noted by the Court of Appeal of Singapore in 
 Mok Swee Kok v PP 
. The petitioner relies on that case in contending that the plea here was not proper because of inconsistencies in terminology in the description of the items stolen and of the stall. The inconsistencies related to the reference to a display counter at the stall instead of roller stands and to the dresses being described variously as suits, traditional dresses, traditional dressing, and Chinese clothings. But these inconsistencies were negligible, and the petitioner was not prejudiced in any way. The elegant variation in terms was perhaps sloppy, but it is clear that no one would have been misled.
The petitioner did not make out his application for revision. The plea of guilt held good, and the petitioner was precluded by s 244, Criminal Procedure Code, from appealing against his conviction. There was a related appeal against sentence, but none of the matters raised by the petitioner constituted relevant mitigation. The magistrate took into account the fact that he was a first offender in her sentencing. There was nothing manifestly excessive in the sentence.",1997-07-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Background
The appellant was convicted after a seven-day trial in a district court on the following four charges: a. Rash driving in a manner as to endanger human life - s 279 Penal Code (Cap 224);
 b. Speeding - s 63(4) Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed) (RTA);
 c. Failing to stop when ordered to do so by a uniformed police officer - s 127(4) RTA;
 d. Giving false information to a police officer - s 182 Penal Code.
 
 
Upon conviction the appellant was sentenced to fines of $1,000 in default two weeks` imprisonment and one year`s disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles in respect of the first charge, $600 in default one week`s imprisonment in respect of the second charge, $500 in default one week`s imprisonment in respect of the third charge, and two weeks` imprisonment in respect of the fourth charge.
The appellant originally appealed against both conviction and sentence. Before me, counsel obtained leave to withdraw the appeal against sentence. At the conclusion of the appeal, I dismissed the appeal against conviction and, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the appeal against sentence, increased the sentence in relation to the first charge (s 279, Penal Code). I now give my reasons.
 The prosecution`s case
The prosecution`s case was that the appellant had committed the first three offences on 21 September 1995 at around midnight along a stretch of the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) just after the exit from Clementi Avenue 6, and along parts of Jurong Town Hall Road, Jurong East Avenue 1 and Jurong East Street 24. The vehicle in question, a Mercedes Benz 200 bearing the registration number ES 3012L, was eventually abandoned at the car park of Blk 249, Jurong East Street 24. This was after a protracted high-speed chase along the aforementioned roads by a traffic policeman on patrol, one Sgt Sapii Ahmad (Sgt Sapii).
Sgt Sapii testified that he had been attached to the patrol unit of the Traffic Police since 1978. He was on night patrol duties when the offences were committed. The defence did not seriously challenge Sgt Sapii`s narration of the relevant sequence of events. The defence`s main contention both below and on appeal was in relation to the reliability of Sgt Sapii`s evidence that he had been able to identify the driver during the chase.
Sgt Sapii testified that he had seen the driver`s face on three occasions. The first occasion was when he was intercepting the speeding car, which had its speed recorded at 150 km/h, 70 km/h in excess of the maximum permissible speed along the PIE. Sgt Sapii said that, while he rode his motorcycle alongside the driver`s side of the car, the driver, a male Indian, turned his head fully and looked at him. They were about one and a half metres away from each other. Sgt Sapii signalled to the driver to stop by sounding his horn and turning on the flashing beacon light of his motorcycle. The driver ignored him and showed him his middle finger before speeding off into a slip road leading into Jurong Town Hall Road. Sgt Sapii followed in pursuit.
Sgt Sapii caught up with the car along Jurong Town Hall Road. Once again, he drew alongside the car on the right side, keeping about one and a half metre`s distance. He signalled to the driver to stop the car. The driver turned his head to look at him but still refused to comply and sped off again. The same scenario repeated itself along Jurong East Avenue 1, except that this time, the driver cut into Sgt Sapii`s path, causing him to swerve in order to avoid a collision. He sped off again, with Sgt Sapii giving chase. The car went against the flow of traffic along Jurong East Street 24 and later along Jurong East Avenue 1, where it caused an oncoming vehicle to swerve and brake suddenly to avoid a collision. It then cut into the path of an oncoming double-decker bus at the junction of Jurong East Avenue 1 and Jurong East Street 24. The bus-driver was forced to jam on the brakes to avoid a collision.
The driver eventually stopped the car at the car park at Blk 249, Jurong East Street 24. Sgt Sapii saw him get out of the car and run away towards Jurong East Avenue 1. Sgt Sapii later lost sight of him. He searched the area together with two officers from the Neighbourhood Police Post but could not locate the driver. He then examined the car, which had been left unlocked with the headlights on. He noticed that there was no key in the ignition and that the car smelled of alcohol. Having confirmed that the car had not been listed as a stolen vehicle, the car was towed back to the Traffic Police pound.
 The defence
At all material times, the appellant was the registered owner of the car. He denied that he was driving his car on 21 September 1995 at around midnight. He claimed that he had an alibi. He had parked the car in the car park below his flat at Blk 334 Jurong East Avenue 1 at about 7 to 7.30pm that night and had remained indoors thereafter. He discovered that his car was missing the next morning at about 9am. His wife and mother came forward to support his alibi.
 The events leading to the arrest and the fourth charge
On 22 September 1995 at about 10am, the appellant went to Jurong Police Station to lodge a police report about his missing car. He was informed that it had been towed away and he was referred to the Traffic Police. At the Traffic Police office, the appellant was interviewed by one S/Sgt Sim Mia Koon (S/Sgt Sim) about his missing vehicle. S/Sgt Sim was the officer assigned to handle investigations relating to the abandoned car.
S/Sgt Sim confirmed that the appellant was the owner of the car, but suspected that he could have been the driver at the material time. S/Sgt Sim then convened an identification parade and arranged for Sgt Sapii to identify the driver. The appellant was identified out of a group of five male Indians. He was placed under arrest by S/Sgt Sim in respect of an offence under s 279 Penal Code.
The last offence was allegedly committed after the appellant had been released on police bail following his arrest. The appellant confirmed that he made the report alleging that his car had gone missing on 22 September 1995. This report formed the basis for the fourth charge.
 The decision below
The district judge was satisfied that Sgt Sapii had given an accurate account of the offences committed on the night of 21 September 1995. He was also satisfied that Sgt Sapii had positively identified the appellant as the driver. While the district judge was conscious of shortcomings in the conduct of the identification parade, he found that Sgt Sapii`s identification was reliable. He was not prepared to accept the testimony of the appellant and his alibi witnesses.
 The appeal
The appeal turned on one crucial finding of fact, namely, whether the appellant had been correctly identified by Sgt Sapii as the driver.
I Sgt Sapii`s observations
The appellant contended that Sgt Sapii could not have seen the driver clearly. He argued that the district judge had failed to consider that Sgt Sapii had only seen the driver for fleeting moments while travelling at a very fast speed, with reflections of the flashing beacon light of the motor cycle off the car`s windows most probably impeding a clear view. It was also contended that Sgt Sapii admitted that he did not have a clear look at the driver.
The appellant pointed out the fact that the car windows were wound up and that the car had been travelling in the centre lane of the PIE when Sgt Sapii first rode alongside it. He further contended that as the motorcycle beacon light was flashing continuously, the reflections against the car windows would have further impaired visibility. With respect, this did not take the defence very far, as the following sequence from Sgt Sapii`s cross-examination revealed:
 
 
Q: Flasher light on, and travelling side by side. Did the flashes of light reflect on the car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: If so, did that hinder your observation of driver? 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
Even allowing for a margin of diminished visibility, there was nothing incredible in Sgt Sapii`s testimony that he was still able to have a good look at the driver`s face. In any case, it was plausible that with the beacon light flashing continuously, this could have illuminated the perimeter of the car and possibly even enhanced Sgt Sapii`s view of the driver`s features. Having said that, Sgt Sapii did not mention that such an effect was achieved. I also noted that the beacon light was located at the rear of the motor-cycle, behind the back seat and would probably not have impeded Sgt Sapii`s view of the driver in any material fashion. Hence, I was of the opinion that this argument was really neither here nor there.
Not surprisingly, the appellant sought to emphasise that Sgt Sapii had in fact admitted that he could not see the driver clearly. It will be pertinent to examine the following exchange in Sgt Sapii`s cross-examination:
 
 
Q: Maintaining that you took a very good look at driver? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Facial features would have been fixed in your mind? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why didn`t you put it down in log sheet and your report the description of driver? 
 
A: Didn`t put it down because cannot see clearly. 
 
(Put) Did not have good look at driver of ES 312L (sic) at that night at PIE? 
 
A: Not true.
  
 
 
In re-examination, Sgt Sapii was asked to clarify why he said he could not see clearly. He replied: `I had a good look at driver`s face but I was in a moving position so that`s why I say cannot see clearly`. This was ambiguous and at variance with his earlier stand that he had taken a `very good look` at the driver and had noted his facial features.
The district judge asked him to explain what he meant. His reply was: `Usually, when can see clearly, ie colour of shirt or pants, would note it down. But since did not see such things clearly, did not describe`. He also said that it did not cross his mind to describe the driver`s facial features in his patrol log sheet, in which he noted that the driver was a `male Indian, mid age`. The appellant was aged 27 at the time of the incident.
It was pertinent to note that Sgt Sapii had consistently said that he had taken a `good look` at the driver in examination-in-chief, cross-examination and re-examination. He had also confirmed that he could recognise the driver, and his face was still fresh in his mind during the identification parade. It appeared somewhat curious, if not entirely illogical, that he would have contradicted himself so patently at that one point in cross-examination.
In my view, Sgt Sapii`s evidence had to be examined in its proper context. He was asked by defence counsel why he did not put down the `description` of the driver. He said he did not do so because he could not `see clearly`. In re-examination, it became apparent that his understanding of a `description` was that it would `describe` a person`s attire. He saw no need to `describe` his facial features since he had taken a `good look at his face, then hair, then size`. Quite apart from the general note within the patrol log sheet that the driver was a `male Indian, mid age`, he was able to recall candidly at the trial that the driver `was bigger-sized than today`. When Sgt Sapii`s evidence was considered in its totality, I had no doubt that the apparent discrepancy in his evidence was not a discrepancy at all.
The district judge agreed that Sgt Sapii would only have been able to see the driver for a fleeting moment on each of the three occasions. Nevertheless, he was satisfied that he would still have had a `clear enough view`, even allowing for visibility constraints. He was mindful of the following matters. Sgt Sapii was in pursuit of a motorist who had committed a traffic offence. His concentration was focused on the task of stopping the driver, and he would have been intent on seeing and remembering the face of the driver. While alongside the driver, the two vehicles were only about 1.5 metres apart. Although the lighting conditions along the PIE were not excellent, Sgt Sapii had said they were `fair` - meaning `average`. More importantly, Sgt Sapii had seen the driver`s face on three separate occasions. On two such occasions, he had a full frontal view of the driver`s face for a few seconds.
The district judge had no doubt that Sgt Sapii had positively identified the appellant and that there was no question as to the quality of the identification. I was satisfied that he had given due consideration to the evidence and was entitled to conclude that Sgt Sapii`s observations were reliable.
II The conduct of the identification parade
In this regard, the appellant contended that the identification parade was improperly conducted and unreliable. All five male Indians on parade did not appear similar, were not the same age and were not dressed similarly. He also contended that S/Sgt Sim had not conducted the parade scrupulously and fairly.
S/Sgt Sim explained that he convened a parade on an urgent basis because the car would be released immediately to the appellant if he was not the driver involved. Otherwise, it would have been impounded. Of the four other persons in the line-up, only one (Anbalakan) was about the same age as the appellant, who was 27 years old at the time. Mohd Ariffin was about 40 years old. The remaining two (Arunachalam and Vaisilingam) were about 50 years old. They were all about the same height as the appellant. The appellant, as well as Vaisilingam, sported a moustache and beard then. The other three did not. Vaisilingam, Arunachalam and Mohd Ariffin were quite well-built. They were all dressed in collared short-sleeved shirts and shorts.
The relevant law is contained in 
Chan Sin v PP
 
 
[1949] MLJ 106
  . In this case, Willan CJ made the following observations at p 108:
 
... it has always been the practice in police identification parades that all the persons on the parade should be of the same nationality as that of the suspected person, as far as possible they should be from the same station in life as that of the suspected person; and also there should be no great disparity of ages in the persons on the parade.
 
 
 
In 
 Chan Sin 
`s case, the parade was conducted in a highly unsatisfactory manner, where `hardly any of the necessary and usual precautions were taken`. The appellant, a 58 year-old Chinese male, was singled out from an identification parade comprising eight persons - one Sikh, three Malays, one Chinese woman and three male Chinese (including the appellant). The conducting officer knew that the suspect was an old Chinese man. However, the other two male Chinese in the line-up were sixteen and ten years younger respectively. Willan CJ opined that in the circumstances, it was a `practical certainty` that the appellant would have been identified.
In the present case, S/Sgt Sim acknowledged that the conduct of the identification parade fell short of the usual standard required. He could not gather more than four other male Indians, and they did not all appear similar to the appellant. Obviously, there was a higher probability of the appellant being picked, than if eight or more `big-sized` male bearded Indians in their late twenties or early thirties had been in the line-up.
In my opinion, however, the disparity in age between the persons in the line-up was not highly material. In Sgt Sapii`s patrol log sheet, it was noted that the driver was `mid-age`. Perhaps it was unfortunate that Sgt Sapii was not asked exactly what age range he was referring to. Either way, it was conceivable that the appellant, being a bearded and mustachioed `big-sized` male, and having what was described by Sgt Sapii as `curly hair, big face`, appeared much older than he really was.
The persons in the line-up need not be of exactly the same description: 
R v Wong Shing
 
[1977-1979] HKC 464
 . It must be self-evident that the more similar their general appearance, the greater the reliability of the identification. However,

`s case does not go as far as to mandate that all the persons procured for the line-up should look similar. Such a requirement would be quite impracticable, and would foreseeably lead to serious problems in the conduct of police investigations. An approach which accords with broad common-sense must be taken.
I noted that at least one other person (Anbalakan) was around the appellant`s age, and another did sport a moustache and beard (Vaisilingam). Three were `well-built` and one was `big-sized` like the appellant, albeit older. However, in Sgt Sapii`s opinion, the five male Indians on parade did not look similar. To him, some were `a little bit young, some big-sized, some small-sized, some middle-aged`. Only one other person appeared as tall as the appellant. Another was `big-sized` like the appellant, but he was middle-aged and appeared older than the appellant. The composition of the line-up could have been better. Nonetheless, it was evident to me that some effort had been taken on S/Sgt Sim`s part to ensure that a fair identification was obtained.
The central issue is the extent of prejudice or unfairness caused by any procedural breach or defect. A breach of the procedural requirements in holding an identification parade does not lead automatically to inadmissibility: 
R v Jones (Terence)
 
[1992] Crim LR 365
 and 
R v Ryan
 
[1992] Crim LR 187
 . Provided the parade is conducted fairly, a failure to comply strictly with instructions in the parade book or other police orders need not be fatal: 
R v Mei
 
[1989] 4 CRNZ 580
 . On the other hand, where there is evidence of bad faith or a `deliberate flouting` of procedural requirements rather than mere inefficiency, the identification will probably not be upheld: 
R v Finley
 
[1993] Crim LR 50
 .
The evidence did not support the appellant`s suggestion that S/Sgt Sim had failed to conduct the parade scrupulously and fairly. When S/Sgt Sim told Sgt Sapii to attend the identification parade, he had only told him that someone was claiming the vehicle. It was Sgt Sapii who then told him that the driver he had encountered the night before was an Indian. S/Sgt Sim did not tell Sgt Sapii anything else. He did not speak to Sgt Sapii again before the identification parade. This was confirmed by Sgt Sapii.
In 
R v Gall
 
[1989] 90 Cr App R 64
 , it was held that identification evidence should have been excluded as the investigating officer had spoken to the inspector in charge and had the opportunity of speaking to the witness before the witness entered the parade room. On the sole basis that this was in breach of Code D of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Court of Appeal apparently held that the mere appearance of unfairness had invalidated the identification. The prevailing view, however, requires examination of whether de facto prejudice was caused: 
 R v Jones (Terence) 
 and 
 R v Ryan 
. Thus, in 
 Ryan 
, although there was a breach of the stipulated procedure, it was found that the identification was still good as nothing untoward had been said to the witness.
Similarly, in the present case, nothing untoward was communicated between Sgt Sapii and S/Sgt Sim, nor was there any discernible indication of deliberate bad faith. The shortcomings such as the limited size and composition of the line-up may have affected the weight to be attached to the identification. However, given that he had just seen the driver only twelve hours earlier, the likelihood that Sgt Sapii`s identification was accurate had to be considered as well. He was able to remember the driver`s appearance very well and his face was still fresh in his mind. Consequently, he was able to spot the driver instantly. His keen recognition of the appellant could explain why he readily stated that the persons in the line-up did not look similar. In all probability, he already had a reasonably clear picture of the person he was looking for. In the circumstances, there was no merit in the appellant`s contentions.
III The defence
Other than his claim that he had been at home the whole time when the offences were allegedly committed, the appellant had to explain how his car had somehow gone missing that very night and had been subsequently involved in a cat-and-mouse game with Sgt Sapii, only to be eventually abandoned by its errant driver barely one kilometre away from his own residence at Jurong East Avenue 1. He also had to explain why the allegedly stolen car bore no sign of forced entry or damage. Hence, he said that he had lost his car key about two weeks before the incident, around the `Jurong area`. He was at home when he discovered the loss of the key. As the `rubber part` of the key had cracked, the key must have fallen off. He did not know where it had fallen off. He obtained a replacement immediately and told both his wife and mother about the loss of the key.
Notwithstanding his expressed concern in quickly getting a replacement key, and in ensuring that his wife and mother were both told about the loss of the key for no apparent reason, the appellant evidently saw no need to consider any anti-theft precautions. He did even say that he had tried to look for the key when he discovered it was missing. He did not mention the lost key to S/Sgt Sim when initially reporting the loss of his car. He later volunteered this information only after he had been charged, while giving his s 122(6) statement. Even then, this was not recorded in the statement and he did not register any protest. Far more telling was the fact that when the appellant later lodged his police report, there was no mention of the loss of his key.
I concurred with the DPP`s characterisation of the appellant`s defence as a `hopelessly ridiculous story`. Even though the key was allegedly lost two weeks earlier, the finder/thief had chosen to take his car out for a joyride that very night. In the DPP`s words, there were phenomenal odds against the finder of that lost key matching it with the car. It was unlikely that the finder/thief would have been heading back towards the direction of Jurong East Avenue 1, where the car had allegedly been stolen from. Finally, the driver was spotted running away from the abandoned car towards the direction of the appellant`s block in Jurong East Avenue 1. The startling degree of coincidence involved was inherently incredible and just too good to be true.
Before me, counsel asserted that it was not the case of the defence that the lost key must have been used by the driver who committed the offences. The appellant`s defence was simply that he did not drive the car that night. With respect, I could not follow his argument. If the defence had been a straightforward one of alibi, there would have been no purpose in bringing up the issue of the lost key at all. Clearly, he had mentioned this in order to lend credence to a theory that some unknown person could have made off with his car that night, without leaving any trace of damage, tampering or forced entry.
This was a typical situation where the district judge had to decide which witness was more believable. The district judge found that Sgt Sapii was a reliable and truthful witness and that the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. I found no reason to disagree. I had no doubt that the defence, which was presumably mounted on the appellant`s instructions, was absolutely unworthy of credit. As for the alibi evidence of the appellant`s wife and mother, once the appellant`s testimony was rejected, their evidence had no value whatsoever. Both were interested witnesses and there was every reason to treat their evidence with caution.
IV Mistakes of fact
I should add that my attention was drawn to a mistake of fact in relation to the existence of a key in the ignition. Apparently, contrary to the district judge`s observations, the police actually did not find any key. According to the DPP, this arose because of a clerical error in typing the court records from the district judge`s handwritten manuscript.
The district judge opined that the appellant`s claim of having lost the key was crucial to explain why a key was left in the ignition. However, this mistaken premise had no material bearing on his decision to convict the appellant, which was based primarily on Sgt Sapii`s identification evidence. For the same reason, no real consequence arose out of the district judge`s mistaken note of an inconsistency between the evidence of the appellant and that of his wife as to when he returned home on 21 September 1995. Insofar as this related to whether the wife`s evidence corroborated that of the appellant, nothing turned on it in view of my finding that the appellant`s defence was not credible and had not raised any reasonable doubt.
 Sentence
Upon counsel`s application, the appeal against sentence was withdrawn. Nonetheless, in reviewing the sentence, I was drawn to conclude that the sentence of a $1,000 fine and disqualification from driving for one year in respect of the first charge under s 279 of the Penal Code (rash driving), was manifestly inadequate.
Where a s 279 charge is involved, the sentence of a fine of $1,000 and one-year`s disqualification may be appropriate for cases not exhibiting any aggravating characteristics. With all due respect to the district judge, there were serious aggravating factors in the appellant`s conduct. It was probably fortuitous that no life-endangering accidents resulted, since there were three occasions when the appellant had caused other vehicles, including Sgt Sapii`s, to swerve and brake suddenly to avoid a collision. On another two occasions, he sped against the flow of traffic.
The appellant had committed the offence of rash driving while indulging in an unrelenting high-speed race to avoid apprehension by a traffic policeman. He was not simply a reckless driver and a menace on the road. He had even resorted to using criminal force to prevent or deter a police officer from discharging his duty. A custodial sentence and a substantial period of disqualification was plainly called for, even though he was a first offender and no injury or damage was actually caused.
Accordingly, I enhanced the sentence in relation to the s 279 charge, while retaining the fine of $1,000, to include four weeks` imprisonment and a total of four years` disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles. I ordered this sentence of imprisonment to run consecutively to the two-week term which he would serve in relation to the fourth charge under s 182 of the Penal Code.",1997-06-09 00:00:00,SG High Court

 The charge
The appellant, a higher technician employed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB), was charged under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (the Act), for having corruptly obtained, as an agent, a gratification in the form of a loan of $4,000 from one Tan Ah Lay, the managing director of Hock Chew Building Construction Pte Ltd (Hock Chew). The gratification was given to the appellant on 13 October 1993, allegedly as an inducement for forbearing to show disfavour to Hock Chew in relation to the appellant`s supervision of the safety aspects of the construction works carried out by Hock Chew at their HDB building project in Woodlands.
The appellant was convicted and sentenced to three months` imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay a penalty of $4,000, in default one month`s imprisonment. The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. After hearing submissions from counsel for the appellant and for the respondent, I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons.
 The prosecution`s case
The evidence adduced by the prosecution was mainly as follows. The appellant was employed by HDB, and was the safety unit officer attached to the safety unit of the Structural Engineering Department. His duties included that of carrying out site inspections to ensure that contractors comply with safety measures, to check the submissions of safety programmes or proposals by contractors, to investigate accidents that occur on site and to recommend actions to prevent such recurrence.
At the material time, the appellant was in charge of the worksite in Woodlands, in respect of a building contract by Hock Chew (the worksite). In the course of inspection, the appellant would indicate in a checklist which he used for the inspection, whether there had been any compliance or non-compliance with safety requirements. Should there be a non-compliance of a non-serious nature, the contractor would be required to take remedial measures by a certain date, failing which HDB would award demerit points to the contractor and levy an administrative charge. If the contractor accumulated 100 demerit points within six months, he would be barred from tendering for HDB projects for three months. Where the non-compliance was of a critical nature, a stop work order would be issued.
The prosecution`s principal witness was one Tan Ah Lay (Tan) who was the managing director of Hock Chew. According to Tan, he saw the appellant about once a week when the latter went to inspect the worksite. However, they were not friends and Tan did not meet with the appellant on a social basis. One week before the alleged incident, the appellant approached Tan at the worksite office and asked for a loan of $4,000. Tan did not accede to the request. Subsequently, on 12 October 1993, the appellant paged for Tan and again asked him for the loan. This time, Tan agreed. The appellant informed Tan that he would go to the worksite the next day and asked Tan to meet him there. Tan explained that he had felt compelled to accede to the appellant`s request for the loan as he was afraid that his project might otherwise be affected.
The next day, the appellant came to the worksite in the morning and met Tan at his office. Tan took out a blank cheque and wrote the figures `$4,000`. He told the appellant to wait for a moment whilst he walked out of the office and into another room to ask his foreman Lau Ley Heng (Lau) to fill up the rest of the cheque, as Tan was illiterate in English. Tan did not explain to Lau why he had issued the cheque. Lau wrote the date `13 October 1993`, the words `Cash` and the amount `Four thousand only`. Tan signed the cheque, went back to his office and handed the cheque to the appellant, who promised to repay the loan when he had the money.
The cheque was cleared on 14 October 1993, but the appellant never repaid the loan. Moreover Tan explained that he did not ask the appellant about the repayment of the loan as he was busy with his work and had forgotten about it.
The prosecution also called one Suzana Chee Beng Yen (Suzana) as their witness. Suzana was a sales agent for Canon Marketing Pte Ltd and had been introduced to the appellant when she visited the premises of the HDB Staff Union (the Union) at Waterloo Street to sell the Union a photocopier. At that time, the appellant was the general secretary of the Union. They subsequently became intimate and met frequently between 1992 until 1994 when their relationship came to an end.
On 13 October 1993, the appellant handed a cheque to Suzana for her to cash. The appellant explained that the cheque had been given by the boss of Hock Chew, and it was for the repayment of a loan which he had made to Tan. The appellant asked her to cash the cheque on his behalf as he could not be seen to have lent money to Tan or to have any dealings of this nature with him.
The following day, Suzana cashed the cheque. She then met the appellant for lunch and handed the cash to him. A few days later, the appellant handed $2,000, together with his bank account book, to Suzana and asked her to deposit the cash into his POSB account. He told her that the money was part of the $4,000 which had been returned by Tan. The next day, Suzana banked the money into the appellant`s account, as reflected in the appellant`s passbook.
 The defence case
The appellant`s defence was essentially that he had never asked Tan for a loan and suggested that Tan must have lent the money to Suzana. He testified as follows. The appellant had been employed by HDB from 1982 and had been involved in the HDB Staff Union since 1984. In 1991, he became the general secretary of the Union and was involved in running the day-to-day affairs of the Union.
Sometime in mid-1992, he asked one Richard Tan Peck Hoon (Richard), then vice-president of the Union, to look into the purchase of a photocopier. That was how he came to know Suzana, who was the sales representative for Canon Marketing. In August 1992, the Union purchased a photocopier from Canon. The appellant and Suzana subsequently developed an intimate relationship. He lavished her with gifts and they went on holidays together. However, the good times did not last and their relationship ended in 1994.
The appellant claimed that sometime in September 1993, Suzana asked him to introduce her to Tan. One day, on the appellant`s normal inspection round at Tan`s worksite, the appellant brought Suzana along and duly introduced her to Tan. The appellant told Tan that Suzana wanted to discuss with Tan about the purchase of a photocopier. Although Suzana claimed to have met Tan on that one occasion only, the appellant said that he saw her with Tan again sometime in October 1993. On that occasion, the appellant asked her what she was doing at Hock Chew`s worksite and she replied that she was soliciting for business.
The appellant also denied that he had asked for a loan from Tan one week before 13 October 1993. It was not disputed that he had gone to the worksite for an inspection on 13 October 1993 between 8.30am and 10.30am, as this was reflected in HDB`s records. However, the appellant denied that he had asked Tan for a loan or that he had received a cheque from him that day.
The appellant further gave an account of his activities that day. After visiting Hock Chew`s worksite, he went to the worksite of Pillar Construction, and remained there from 11.15am to 11.30am. He then went to Toa Payoh where he picked up Richard. Together, they left for the appellant`s brother`s house which apparently had been burgled. At about 1.40pm, the appellant and Richard left for a meeting at the Union house. The meeting started at 2pm and ended at 7pm.
After the meeting was over, the appellant had a discussion with Richard and one Tan Chuan Juan (Chuan Juan) who was the deputy general secretary of the Union, regarding a disciplinary inquiry which was to take place the next day at Bishan. When the discussion ended, it was around 9pm. The appellant and Richard went for a drink at Europa Ridley and then proceeded to have dinner at around 10pm. The appellant denied meeting Suzana that day, and his alibi was corroborated by Richard`s and Chuan Juan`s testimonies.
The next day, the appellant, Richard and Chuan Juan met for breakfast at 8.30am and then proceeded to Bishan to conduct the disciplinary inquiry. The inquiry ended at 2pm. After the inquiry, the three of them went for lunch. At 3pm, Chuan Juan left the company of the appellant and Richard, who proceeded to the Union house. The appellant left the Union house at around 6pm. Again, the appellant stated that it was impossible for him to have met Suzana during lunch that day, as he was still at the disciplinary inquiry until 2pm. Richard and Chuan Juan`s testimonies essentially corroborated the appellant`s as to their whereabouts on that day.
In respect of the $2,000 which was banked into his POSB account on 19 October 1993, the appellant denied that Suzana had done it for him. According to the appellant, Suzana paged for him on 19 October and insisted on seeing him that day. The appellant told her to meet him at the POSB Bank at the Westin Stamford hotel at 12noon. They then went for lunch. During lunch, the appellant told her that he had gone to the POSB to bank in $2,000, which was his wife`s money. That was how Suzana had come to know of the $2,000.
The appellant claimed that Suzana was a spendthrift and that she had borrowed money from him on various occasions. For instance, in May 1993, she borrowed $8,000 to buy a car; in September 1993, she borrowed a sum of $5,000; in January 1994, she again borrowed $7,000 from the appellant; and sometime later, the appellant lent her another $7,000. To date, Suzana had only returned to him $3,500.
The appellant also produced an IOU note prepared on 27 March 1995, in which was stated that Suzana owed him $20,000. The appellant explained that Suzana had asked for a further loan in 1995 and had agreed to sign the IOU note when the appellant, Suzana and one Sampath were at Europa Ridley. Sampath confirmed that he had signed the IOU note as a witness, after Suzana had signed it.
One Ragu Ramchuran (Ragu), who was the supervisor at Europa Ridley, testified that he had seen the IOU note. Ragu had known the appellant since 1994. According to Ragu, he recalled seeing the appellant, Suzana and Sampath at Europa Ridley on 27 March 1995. He passed by their table and saw them having a discussion pertaining to a document. He also saw Sampath signing the said document. Later in the night, as Ragu was standing at the entrance of Europa Ridley, the appellant came up to him and showed him the said document, which he realised was the IOU note. Sometime later, Ragu saw Suzana approach the appellant and demand the return of the IOU note. The appellant refused to give it to her and she left in anger.
When cross-examined, the appellant admitted that he had known Richard for some six to seven years. They had a good relationship and would help each other. It would also seem that the appellant and Sampath were close friends as well, as they had also known each other for five or six years. Moreover, as Sampath himself testified, they would help each other in their personal and family problems. This was evident when the appellant was facing some problems in his relationship with Suzana and had sought Sampath`s help. The appellant also admitted that he could not recall the events on 13 and 14 October and had to verify them with Richard and Chuan Juan.
The final witness called by the defence was one Lim Bock Heng (Lim), who was the operations manager of Spots Management Services. Essentially, Lim was called to corroborate the appellant`s evidence that the latter had seen Suzana with Tan on another occasion. According to Lim, sometime in October 1993, the appellant and he were going to Sungei Kadut. On the way, the appellant stopped by the worksite to pick up Suzana. At the worksite, Lim saw Suzana talking to Tan, before she proceeded to join them.
Reverting to Suzana`s testimony, she claimed that she did not know Tan and had only met him once when she was with the appellant and they had stopped by the worksite. She denied meeting Tan in October 1993, as alleged by the appellant and Lim, or thereafter. Moreover, she had never approached Tan to buy her company`s products as Hock Chew was outside her sales zone. Thus, even if she were to canvass business from Hock Chew, she would not get any commission, as the sales would be referred to another agent of Canon who was in charge of that zone. In any event, Suzana denied taking a loan from Tan.
Moreover, she claimed that she had only borrowed $5,000 from the appellant and had returned it to him in two instalments in July 1993. As for the IOU note, the appellant wanted her to sign it to pacify those from whom he had borrowed money, presumably to show his creditors that he had the money to repay them. However, she claimed that the note was not signed when they were at Europa Ridley. Rather, it was signed in the appellant`s car when they were together alone. As she never borrowed that sum of money from the appellant, he assured her that he would not bother her for it. In fact, after signing the IOU note, she never saw the appellant again, nor did he harass her for the $20,000.
 The trial judge`s decision
The ingredients of the charge which the prosecution had to prove were as follows: (a). that the appellant was a higher technician employed by the HDB on or about 13 October 1993;
 (b). that he had obtained a loan of $4,000 for himself from Tan, the managing director of Hock Chew;
 (c). that he had obtained the loan corruptly; and
 (d). that the gratification was an inducement for forbearing to show disfavour to Hock Chew in his inspection of their worksite.
 
 
It was not in dispute that the appellant was a higher technician in the safety unit of HDB and thus an agent within the scope of s 6(a) of the Act. As for the second ingredient, the trial judge had to assess the credibility of the witnesses as it was purely a question of whom to believe. The testimony which provided the evidence to prove the second ingredient came primarily from one witness, namely, Tan himself. However, the trial judge was aware that Tan was an accomplice as he had given the loan to the appellant. Nevertheless, under s 25 of the Act:
 
Notwithstanding any rule of law or written law to the contrary, no witness shall, in any such trial or inquiry as is referred to in section 24, be presumed to be unworthy of credit by reason only of any payment or delivery by him or on his behalf of any gratification to an agent or member of a public body.
 
 
 
The trial judge chose to accept the testimony of Tan and rejected the testimony of the appellant. In doing so, he was mindful of the inconsistencies in Tan`s evidence but was of the view that those inconsistencies were not material in nature and did not undermine his evidence in respect of the key issues. Moreover, there was a long lapse of time between the events and the trial which could have affected Tan`s ability to recount the events accurately. In any event, there was no reason for Tan to frame the appellant, and overall the trial judge was satisfied that he was a truthful witness.
Thus the trial judge found that Tan had given the loan to the appellant, and not to Suzana as the appellant had alleged. The defence case was that Suzana was very capable of taking advantage of the appellant`s position vis-a-vis Tan and that she was given to taking loans. However, the trial judge observed that, when cross-examined, the appellant was evasive in his answers and could not state any reason why Suzana would use the appellant`s name to obtain money from Tan. Moreover, if she needed any money, she could have asked the appellant who would have been willing to lend it to her.
The third ingredient of the charge was whether the appellant had obtained the gratification corruptly. On this point, the trial judge relied on the presumption of corruption under s 8 of the Act which read:
 
Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence under section 5 or 6, it is proved that any gratification has been paid or given to or received by a person in the employment of the Government or any department thereof or of a public body by or from a person or agent of a person who has or seeks to have any dealing with the Government or any department thereof or any public body, that gratification shall be deemed to have been paid or given and received corruptly as an inducement or reward as hereinbefore mentioned unless the contrary is proved.
 
 
 
The trial judge was satisfied that the appellant had not, on a balance of probabilities, rebutted the presumption that the loan was obtained corruptly.
The next issue was whether the loan was an inducement for the appellant to forbear from showing disfavour to Hock Chew when the appellant was inspecting the worksite. Tan explained that he had acceded to the request for the loan because he thought that there might be problems at his company`s worksite if he were to reject the request. With regard to this, defence counsel argued that the appellant had not at any time shown any favour to Hock Chew. In particular, the appellant referred to an incident where a worker had fallen to his death from a scaffolding at the worksite. Hock Chew had been penalised for that incident. As such, it could not be said that the appellant had shown any favour to Hock Chew.
On this point raised by the defence, the trial judge referred to s 9 of the Act which read as follows:
 
Where in any proceedings against any agent for any offence under s 6(a), it is proved that he corruptly obtained or agreed to accept or attempted to obtain any gratification, having reason to believe or suspect that the gratification was offered as an inducement or reward for his doing or forbearing to do any act or for showing or forbearing to show any favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs or business, he shall be guilty of an offence under that section notwithstanding that he did not have the power, right or opportunity to do so, show or forbear or that he did not in fact do so, show or forbear or that the act, favour or disfavour was not in relation to his principal`s affairs or business.
 
 
 
The trial judge held that by reason of s 9 of the Act, even if the appellant had not, in the circumstances of the case, forborne to show disfavour to Hock Chew, he would still be guilty of the offence.
In rejecting the testimonies of the appellant and the defence witnesses, the trial judge noted that the appellant, Richard and Chuan Juan had discussions which enabled them to recall and piece together the events, of 13 and 14 October 1993, in a detailed manner. Thus, what the appellant testified was not what he could recall, but a collation of what the three of them could collectively recall. Thus, the trial judge found the appellant guilty of the offence.
 The issues on appeal
There was no dispute that Tan had written a cash cheque dated 13 October 1993 for $4,000 and that this cheque had been cashed the next day. There was also no doubt that the appellant was present at the worksite on 13 October 1993 as recorded in the HDB`s notes of inspection of the worksite. If it could be shown that the appellant had taken the loan, the presumptions under ss 8 and 9 of the Act would apply. In his defence below and on appeal, the appellant had not raised the issue of whether the loan had been obtained corruptly or not. His only defence was that he had never taken a loan from Tan. As such, the only issue was whether Tan had indeed given a loan to the appellant and it would seem that the case rested entirely on the evidence of the witnesses.
It was undoubtedly the case that it was merely Tan`s word against the appellant`s on the incident of 13 and 14 October 1993, as there were no eye-witnesses to corroborate their stories. The trial judge chose to accept Tan`s version of events and rejected the appellant`s evidence as he found the latter to be evasive in cross-examination and was unreliable and untruthful.
It has been decided in 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
  that an appellate court will not disturb the findings of fact of the court below unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, the appellate court has to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judge`s findings and reasons therefore. In the present case, I was of the view that there was no reason to overturn the trial judge`s decision as it had not been reached against the weight of the evidence.
If indeed Tan had lent the money to Suzana, there would have been no reason for him to implicate the appellant. After all, in so doing, he risked being implicated as well, as he was an accomplice to the transaction. Moreover, the appellant claimed that Tan had told him that Suzana had `played [Tan] out`. If Tan had indeed felt `cheated` by Suzana, he would have brought an action against her to recover the loan, rather than risking his own reputation in this matter by accusing the appellant. As the appellant himself admitted, Tan bore no grudge against him. Why then, would Tan make a false allegation against the appellant? There was simply no reason for Tan to lie.
I also agreed with the trial judge that there was no reason why Tan would lend any money to Suzana, since, but for that one meeting, she was a stranger to Tan. Moreover, there was no reason for Suzana to approach Tan for a loan when she could have easily obtained one from the appellant. From the appellant`s own evidence, it was clear that Suzana would approach him whenever she was in need of money. She would do so whether their relationship was in a good or turbulent state. Whenever Suzana approached the appellant for money, he would give or loan it to her either out of his own funds or, if he did not have the requisite funds, he would borrow from his friends. This clearly showed that the appellant was willing to go out of his way to lend Suzana money, by borrowing from his friends. As the appellant testified, even as late as January 1994, he had borrowed $7,000 from Richard to lend to her, although their relationship was not smooth going then.
In reliance upon the assertion that the money might have been loaned to Suzana, defence counsel alleged that there was evidence that she was given to taking loans. However, I agreed with the trial judge that this argument could equally apply to the appellant himself. The evidence of the defence witnesses showed that the appellant, too, was prone to borrowing money. As the trial judge stated, and I agreed, it would not be out of character for the appellant to obtain a loan from Tan.
As for the inconsistencies in Tan`s evidence, the trial judge had correctly adopted the approach that there was no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in its entirety or not at all. So long as the inconsistencies were minor in nature, or related to minor issues, it did not undermine his evidence in respect of the key issues. In 
Chean Siong Guat v PP
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
  , Abdul Hamid J stated at pp 63-64:
 
Discrepancies may, in my view, be found in any case for the simple reason that two person can describe the same thing in exactly the same way. Sometimes what appears to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how discrepancies are likely to arise. These discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies. Absolute truth is, I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common occurrence. In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court. Being a question of fact, what a magistrate needs to do is to consider the discrepancies and say whether they are minor or serious discrepancies ... On the other hand, if a magistrate finds the discrepancies do not detract from the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses, it would be proper for him to regard the discrepancies as trivial and ignore them. On the other hand, if a magistrate finds that the discrepancies relate to a material point which would seriously affect the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses, then, it would be his duty to weigh the evidence carefully in arriving at the truth.
 
 
 
I had subsequently endorsed this view in the case of 
PP v Kalpanath Singh
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 564
  .
The appellant also sought to challenge the evidence of Suzana and Tan on the ground that they had lied about meeting on only one occasion, that is, when the appellant had first introduced Suzana to Tan. This was because, one Lim Bock Heng (Lim), who was an independent witness, had seen Suzana and Tan together sometime in October 1993.
It was pertinent to note that the trial judge had not expressly dealt with the evidence of Lim Bock Heng in his grounds of decision. One of two possible conclusions could be derived from the trial judge`s failure to mention Lim`s evidence. First, by rejecting the appellant`s evidence, he must have implicitly rejected Lim`s evidence as well, since otherwise the event of October 1993 as narrated by the appellant and Lim would be diametrically opposite to the version of events presented by Tan and Suzana. Alternatively, the trial judge could have accepted the appellant`s and Lim`s evidence as to the particular incident in October 1993, that they had seen Suzana together with Tan. If so, Suzana and Tan would have lied on that matter. Did that mean then that their evidence should be rejected in toto?
In 
Teo Geok Fong v Lim Eng Hock
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 431
  , I had stated the following:
 
It has been decided in 
PP v Somwang Phatannasaeng
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 138
  and again in 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 701
  that in the context of impeachment of a witness` credibility, the mere fact that the credit of a witness had been impeached did not necessarily mean that all his evidence would be disregarded. The court would still have to scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine what was true and which aspects should be disregarded. A fortiori, where the credit of a witness had not been impeached, as in the present case, the same rules would apply.
 
 
 
Even if Suzana and Tan were found to have lied on some matters, it did not affect their credibility as a whole. There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either be believed in its entirety or not at all. A court is fully competent, for good and cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and to reject the other - per Raja Azlan Shah FJ (as he then was) in 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)
 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 15
  .
Thus, in the present case, I was satisfied that the trial judge had not made an error of law in relying on the testimonies of Tan and Suzana and in rejecting the testimonies of the defence witnesses, even if I were to assume that Tan and Suzana had lied about certain matters. As the trial judge had the benefit of observing the demeanour of the witnesses, and had given careful consideration to their evidence as a whole, I was reluctant to disturb his findings of fact.
I believed that in reaching his conclusion, the trial judge had observed certain pertinent points about the case. First, it was undeniable that the appellant was at Hock Chew`s worksite on 13 October 1993 when the cheque was issued by Tan. The cheque was cashed the next day. Only one of two persons could have been the culprit - the appellant or Suzana. This led to the second point - that there was no reason for Tan to lie, since, as the appellant himself admitted, Tan did not bear any grudge against him. Third, there was no reason for Tan to lend Suzana any money since he did not know her. Even if we assumed that Tan was acquainted with Suzana, and had lent her the money, I could not see why he would go on to allege that the appellant was the culprit. Fourth, there was no reason for Suzana to lie as it had not been shown nor suggested by the appellant that she bore any grudge against him.
Finally, the trial judge must have felt that, given the proximity of the appellant`s relationship with Richard and Chuan Juan, they might have been willing to lie on this occasion to corroborate the appellant`s evidence and help him. Moreover, without them, the appellant would not have been able to recall the events of 13 and 14 October 1993 at all, let alone recall them in such a consistent and detailed fashion.
As such, the trial judge`s finding that the appellant had indeed taken a loan from Tan should be upheld. This being the case, the presumption under s 8 would be triggered. As the appellant`s case rested entirely on the allegation that he had never received the loan and not that he had not received it corruptly, the appellant had thus failed to rebut the presumption under s 8 since he did not raise any evidence to prove the contrary.
As for the sentence imposed, I was not minded to disturb it, given that the offence of corruption is a serious one. Moreover, the fact that the appellant was holding a public office was a further aggravating factor. Hence, I dismissed the appeal.",1997-06-06 00:00:00,SG High Court

Action by plaintiff against defendant for damages for loss of consortium
  – 
Whether husband whose wife had left him could maintain action against interloper for damages in Singapore
  – 
Whether tort of enticement part of law in Singapore
 
The issue in this appeal was whether in Singapore a husband, whose wife had left him for another man, could maintain an action against the interloper for damages.
 Background
The plaintiff`s statement of claim recites that when his wife went to buy a handphone at a teleshop, the defendant, a salesman who is several years younger than the plaintiff`s wife, had somehow managed to win her affection and persuaded her to leave the plaintiff. The pleadings further allege that since about February 1996 the defendant and the plaintiff`s wife had been seeing each other and were in adulterous union. The plaintiff therefore had brought this action claiming damages against the defendant for loss of consortium. The cause of action, as the plaintiff`s counsel had put it, was founded on the tort of enticement.
The defendant`s application to strike out the statement of claim on grounds that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action and was frivolous or vexatious or in the alternative an abuse of the process of court, was dismissed by the assistant registrar with costs. The appeal by the defendant against the decision of the assistant registrar was heard by me on 28 August 1996. I allowed the appeal and struck out the statement of claim with each party bearing its own costs and I now set out my grounds although there is no appeal pending against my decision.
 Decision
The husband`s action, as submitted by his counsel, was based on the tort of enticement and what the plaintiff purported to achieve by this suit was to obtain monetary compensation from the defendant for the loss of his wife`s consortium ie, his right to have his wife`s company, assistance, affection and fellowship. Of course, under common law an action for damages used to lie for loss of consortium caused by any wrongful act including enticement of one spouse from the other.
The nature of the tort of enticement was described by Greer LJ in 
Place v Searle
 
[1932] 2 KB 497
 (CA) at p 517 quoting with approval a passage from
 Lush on Husband and Wife 
 (3rd Ed) at p 3 as follows:
 
... I agree that there is no room for dispute as to the law to be applied. It is accurately stated in the words quoted by Scrutton LJ from 
 Lush on Husband and Wife
, although I should like to make one or two verbal alterations in the proposition there stated. At the foot of p 3 of that work it is said that: `
 Corresponding to the husband`s dominion over the person of his wife is the duty of the wife to reside and consort with her husband
. This is a duty which she owes to him, and a person who tempts or entices her to violate this duty commits a wrong towards the husband for which he is entitled to recover damages; unless the person who harboured her acted from ""principles of humanity.""` I think it would verbally be more accurate if, instead of using the words `tempts or entices her,` it were said `procures, entices or persuades,` and then, instead of the word `harboured,` were substituted `procured, enticed or persuaded` her, the statement then continuing as in the text. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It would appear from the foregoing passage that the tort of enticement is predicated on the pre-World War II perception that the husband had dominion over the person of his wife and it was incumbent on the wife not only to reside and consort with the husband, but also to forever please him. But since the war, many common law commentators consistently decried this view and called for the tort`s abolition. They argued that to hold that the wife is a mere appurtenance to the husband was not in tandem with reality and the currents of public opinion.
So much so, the UK Law Commission on Family Law (Cmnd No 25) recommended that actions for damages for adultery and the tort of enticement be abolished (paras 101 and 102 at p 50 of the report). It appears from the report that the Law Commission based its recommendations on the advice contained in the Commission`s Working Paper and the relevant segment of the Working Paper as appears at paras 132 and 133 (see App II at pp 134 and 135 of the report) reads as follows:
 
 
132 We have already pointed out the close connection between claims for damages for adultery and the independent action for enticement which enables a husband or wife to sue a third party who has induced the other spouse to leave or remain apart. This action was recommended for abolition by the Law Reform Committee in the Eleventh Report [Cmnd 2017] and is also among those actions we are charged under Item XV of our First Programme to review. Many of the same objections apply both to actions for damages for adultery and for enticement. Both treat the wife as the husband`s chattel, and lend themselves to blackmail especially when there is collusion between husband and wife. Both encourage perjury when there is collusion between the wife and her seducer. But in some respects, the action for damages for adultery is more objectionable than that for enticement. The latter at least recognises that the claim is based on the fact that the husband, because of the defendant, has lost his wife. The former purports to compensate the husband for the fact that the defendant has had sexual intercourse with the wife. This rather barbarous theoretical basis of the action has adverse practical consequences in that the parties are able to place one another in a humiliating position and when proceedings are brought they tend to create great bitterness between the parties. The action for enticement also has the merit of treating both sexes alike, for the English courts (differing in this respect from those of some other parts of the common law world) have held that it is available to a wife as well as a husband, whereas damages for adultery in divorce proceedings are obtainable only by the husband against the male co-respondent. 
 
133 Strictly speaking, the action for enticement, not being a matrimonial cause, falls outside the scope of this Paper. But it is so closely related to damages for adultery, which, as already indicated, cannot be excluded from consideration here, that we cannot ignore it. As already pointed out, the Law Reform Committee recommended its abolition. No steps have been taken to implement this proposal, but the action is among those for which legal aid is not available, which may be taken as some sign of legislative discouragement of the action. It is an action which is uncommon and which had almost fallen into desuetude until public attention was drawn to its continued existence by a case which attracted some notice in 1932 [
 Place v Searle 
, supra]. Success is rarely achieved since the plaintiff has to discharge the onus of proving that the alleged enticer has done more than offer advice or alienate the spouse`s affection and the courts are reluctant to allow an action against parents-in-law. The Law Commission`s provisional view is that the action should be abolished.
  
 
 
It is useful to remember that even before the Law Commission had called for the demise of the said tort, the House of Lords as early as 1952, in 
Best v Samuel Fox & Co Ltd
 
[1952] AC 716
 viewed such a cause of action as an anomaly. Lord Porter in his speech said at p 728: `
 that today a husband`s right of action for loss of his wife`s consortium is an anomaly and see no good reason for extending it 
.`
The result was, the parliament of the United Kingdom by enacting the Law Reform Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1970 (C 33), abolished damages for adultery and actions for enticement of wife in England. As regards damages for adultery, s 4 of the Act provides inter alia that:
 
After this Act comes into force no person shall be entitled to petition any court for, or include in a petition a claim for, damages from any other person on the ground of adultery with the wife of the first-mentioned person.
 
 
 
As respects the tort of enticement, s 5(a) of the said Act provides:
 
No person shall be liable in tort under the law of England and Wales -
 
 
 
 
(a) to any other person on the ground only of his having induced the wife or husband of that other person to leave or remain apart from the other spouse;
  
 
 
Insofar as Singapore is concerned, there does not appear to be any reported case where a spouse has brought an action based on the tort of enticement, despite the view that this cause of action would have been received by Singapore through the Second Charter of Justice and indeed a case could be made that it is part of the law of Singapore.
The question before me was whether this tort is still part of the law in Singapore, particularly when it was abolished in the place of its origin on the ground that it had outlived its usefulness and fallen into desuetude. Tan Cheng Han, the author of 
 Matrimonial Law in Singapore and Malaysia 
 (Butterworths Asia, 1994) expresses the view that the torts of enticement and harbouring must be regarded in today`s world as anamalous in the light of the changed attitude towards marriage and divorce. He says that though these causes of action may still be part of the common law of Singapore and Malaysia since neither jurisdiction has expressly abolished them, it is possible however for the courts in both countries to refuse to follow the old English cases since these causes of action do not have much of a history in Singapore and Malaysia as they are clearly inappropriate to social conditions in both societies. He comments further that even if such actions were made out, it would be unlikely for the plaintiff to obtain more than nominal damages.
Returning to the pleadings at hand, it is clear that what the plaintiff was seeking under the guise of loss of consortium was damages for adultery from his wife`s lover. Prior to 1980, by virtue of s 104 of the Women`s Charter (Cap 47, 1970 Ed), a husband in a petition for divorce or for judicial separation was at liberty to claim damages from any person on the ground of his having committed adultery with the petitioner`s wife. However the said provision was repealed by amendments to the Women`s Charter in 1980 (Cap 353, 1985 Ed) (also see ss 85, 88(3)), the effect being the right of a petitioner husband to claim damages against a co-respondent for damages had been taken away (see the observations of Chao Hick Tin J in 
Tan Kay Poh v Tan Surida & Anor
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 276
  ; 
[1988] SLR 983
). Though I do recognise that the tort of enticement and a claim for damages for adultery are separate causes of action, there is no denying as has been acknowledged by the UK Law Commission (Cmnd No 25) that there is a close connection between them. This meant even if the tort of enticement were to be subsisting in Singapore despite its disapproval and consequent abolition in England, the damages payable, if any, would be at best nominal or derisory.
Having regard to the perfunctory nature of the pleadings and taking the pleadings at its face value, it is my view that to give currency to a cause of action which had no known presence in Singapore and one which had been given a final farewell in its place of birth would be to lend a hand to encouraging fruitless litigation for vindictive purposes. In my opinion, though the tort of enticement might well have been received in Singapore under the Second Charter of Justice, it cannot continue to serve any useful purpose particularly when society no longer subscribes to the view that women are mere chattels and whose existence is only to be in the service of their husbands. Sections 45, 46, 48 and 49 of the Women`s Charter clearly underscore the aspect that a wife is a person in her own right and not someone who is subordinate to, or a chattel of her husband.
For the reasons I have thus stated, I allowed the defendant`s appeal and struck out the statement of claim on the grounds that the action was frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the process of court. However, in the light of the peculiar issues involved, I ordered that each party should bear its own costs. The plaintiff`s counsel who at one stage wrote and had requested further arguments, subsequently abandoned his application informing the court that the plaintiff would not be proceeding further.",1997-04-24 00:00:00,SG High Court

This was an appeal by the Public Prosecutor against the decision of the district judge in the court below to acquit the respondent, Liew Kim Choo, of two offences under s 146(1) of the Women`s Charter (Cap 353), which reads:
 
Any person who knowingly lives wholly or in part on the earnings of the prostitution of another person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000.
 
 
 
The accused was brought to trial on the following charges:
 
You, Liew Kim Choo, Female/36 years old, are charged that you, between 6 March 1996 and 15 April 1996, in Singapore, did knowingly live in part on the earnings of the prostitution of one, Lee Swee Ling, I/C No 770608-14-5306 (FOM) and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 146(1) of the Women`s Charter (Cap 353).
 
 
 
and
 
You, Liew Kim Choo, Female/36 years old, are charged that you, between 18 March 1996 and 15 April 1996, in Singapore, did knowingly live in part on the earnings of the prostitution of one, Lee Phui Yoke, I/C No 760512-14-5230 (FOM) and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 146(1) of the Women`s Charter (Cap 353).
 
 
 
At the close of the defence, the trial judge found that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused of both charges.
 Background
Lee Swee Ling (`PW2`) and Lee Phui Yoke (`PW3`) were prostitutes working in Singapore under the direction of one Lim How Kim (`PW4`), also known as `Ah Gu`.
On 16 April 1996, the Anti-Vice Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department (`AVB`) conducted a `sting` operation on prostitution activities involving PW2, PW3 and PW4. Corporals Lim Seng Chuan (`PW5`) and Lim Eng Yong (`PW6`) checked into Room 303 of the Rangoon Hotel, Singapore. Using a handphone, they dialed telephone number 7334267 and asked for girls to be supplied to them in the hotel.
At around 3.40pm PW2 and PW3 arrived at their hotel room. They negotiated the price of sexual services with PW5 and PW6. Once the price was agreed upon, a female Sergeant emerged from her hiding place in a cupboard and detained PW2 and PW3. After some questioning, PW2 and PW3 revealed that they had been brought to the hotel by PW4. They agreed to call PW4 and to ask him to come and pick them up from a location near the hotel. PW5 and PW6 together with Detective Lim Yew Boon (`PW8`) waited for PW4 at the pick-up point and detained him when he arrived. PW4 was driving a dark blue Honda registration number SBC 8968 R.
PW4 subsequently pleaded guilty to managing a place of assignation in his motor car registration number SBC 8968 R and to two charges of living off the earnings of prostitution. He was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 in respect of each offence. The respondent and her husband, one Tan Choo Peek, were arrested in connection with the charges against PW4 and charged on 17 April 1996. The respondent was charged with the two abovementioned charges and a third charge of managing a place of assignation. Her husband was also charged with management of a place of assignation.
 The first appeal
The respondent`s husband was tried together with the respondent but the district judge did not call for their defences and acquitted them, finding that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case. The public prosecutor appealed against the decision of the district judge. The appeal proceeded only on the two charges against the respondent of living off immoral earnings. The charge against the respondent`s husband was not proceeded with. The charge against the respondent of managing a place of assignation was similarly not proceeded with.
On appeal, the parties appeared before me. The public prosecutor argued that he had adduced sufficient circumstantial evidence from which it could be reasonably inferred that the respondent had committed the offences with which she had been charged. I was in agreement with the public prosecutor. In my grounds of decision [see 
[1997] 2 SLR 443
] dated 31 March 1997 I stated [at [para ] 50]:
 
In my opinion, a prima facie case against the respondent had been shown for the following reasons: (1) there was evidence not inherently incredible to reasonably infer that the respondent was the person who made the arrangements for the prostitutes; and (2) there was evidence not inherently incredible to reasonably infer that she was receiving payment for this because her efforts were unlikely to be gratuitous.
 
 
 
On a minimal evaluation of the evidence, I found that the district judge had erred in concluding that there was no case to answer. I therefore remitted the case to the district court for the defence to be called. The trial judge, having done so, concluded that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and acquitted the respondent. The case before me was therefore the second appeal against acquittal.
 The charges against the respondent
The prosecution`s case was that the respondent, also known to friends and business associates as `Katherine`, was responsible for arranging for customers to patronise prostitutes working for `Ah Gu`. The respondent would contact `Ah Gu` whenever she had potential clients for his prostitutes. `Ah Gu` would also contact her from time to time to ask whether she had any clients for him. The number `Ah Gu` would use to call her was 7334267.
The telephone number 7334267 was registered in the name of Phoenix Escort Agency, the proprietor of which was the respondent. The respondent also used the same number for another business, Anna Beauty Salon, of which she was also the proprietor.
The prosecution alleged that Phoenix Escort Agency and Anna Beauty Salon were used by the respondent to cover her involvement in the prostitution business. Potential customers would contact her at 7334267 to ask for girls. PW4 would also contact her at 7334267 to ask for customers. The respondent was the middlewoman between the customers and PW4. The respondent would inform PW4 where the customers wished to meet the girls. PW4 would then arrange to send the girls to the designated premises.
Upon arrival at the premises, the girls would call 7334267 to inform the respondent that they had arrived. They never, however, knew the identity of the person who answered the phone at 7334267. After sex, the customers would pay the girls directly for the services rendered. The girls would then call 7334267 to ask for someone to pick them up. They would be picked up by PW4. They would keep some of the money for themselves and hand over the rest to PW4. PW4 would keep some for himself and pay the remainder to the respondent. This was the prosecution`s case.
 The evidence against the respondent
The evidence against the respondent was largely circumstantial. She admitted that she used the telephone number 7334267 for her escort agency and beauty salon. Curiously, although the phone line for 7334267 was installed at an address in Tomlinson Road, the registered address for the respondent`s businesses was at Loyang Rise.
The respondent explained in evidence that her husband had once owned the residence at Tomlinson Road. At the time, she used the number at Tomlinson Road for her business. When her husband sold that property, she wished to retained the number so as not to lose her customers. She therefore preserved the line at the Tomlinson Road house, which was sold to a friend. She then purchased a handphone, telephone number 98183928, to which she transferred calls made to 7334267. Callers to number 7334267 were therefore redirected to the respondent`s handphone 98183928.
The respondent took out advertisements in Chinese newspapers offering:
 
Facial cleansing for males only. From here and abroad. If interested, call Miss Anna at 7334267.
 
 
 
The prosecution suggested that these advertisements, although purporting to attract business for her beauty salon, represented veiled efforts on the part of the respondent to attract customers for prostitutes. It alleged that `Miss Anna` was actually the respondent, Liew Kim Choo, the proprietor of Anna Beauty Salon. Persons responding to the invitation to call 7334267 for `services` would have their calls redirected to the respondent`s handphone, 98183928
The prosecution sought to establish some relationship between PW4 and the respondent. In his evidence-in-chief, PW4 admitted that PW2 and PW3 worked for him as prostitutes but claimed not to know the respondent. He also claimed that he alone determined the price the girls should ask for sex. In pleading guilty to the charges against him, PW4 had earlier admitted to a statement of facts which contained statements inconsistent with his evidence-in-chief. The DPP thus made an application under s 147 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine PW4. The district judge granted the application.
In cross-examination by the DPP on his statement of facts, PW4 admitted that he knew one `Anna` who had a `permanent wave salon` and that he would contact her at telephone number 7334267. PW4 said he knew her through newspaper advertisements. He stated that he would call `Anna` to ask if she had customers for his prostitutes. If there were customers, `Anna` would call him back on his handphone, number 98245913. The prosecution suggested that PW4 obtained customers from the same `Anna` referred to in the newspaper advertisements allegedly taken out by the respondent, ie that the respondent was supplying customers to PW4. The force of this suggestion was amplified by PW3`s evidence that that the name of the person she contacted at 7334267 was one `Miss Tan` - the respondent`s maiden name is `Liew` but her husband`s surname is `Tan`.
PW4, however, maintained his claim not to know the true identity of `Anna`. He did give evidence that `Anna` would inform him of the price customers were to pay. He also said he told his prostitutes to call the number 7334267 when they met their customers, to inform the person receiving the call that they had arrived. He testified that they did not call 7334267 to be picked up, but that they called him directly on his handphone. Because PW4 did not finger the respondent as being the person known as `Anna`, there was no direct evidence that the respondent had obtained his prostitutes through her. It was, however, the prosecution`s case that the circumstantial evidence inexorably supported the inference that `Anna` and the respondent were one and the same.
To reinforce this, the prosecution adduced telephone records showing that over 190 calls had been made from the respondent`s handphone 98183928 to PW4`s handphone number 98245913 between 1 April 1996 and 16 April 1996. Records were also adduced to show that a similar number of calls had been made from PW4`s handphone to either the respondent`s handphone 98183928 or her business number 7334267 over the same period. This revealed a constant and intensive course of communication.
Again, this course of communication did not necessarily show that the communication took place between the respondent and PW4, as the identity of the person who replied to calls made to 7334267 and 98183928 was never directly established. PW2, PW3 and PW4 claimed in evidence that they did not know the identity of the person who picked up the calls. PW4 said he only knew her as `Anna` and that he did not know her true identity.
The prosecution`s own witness, Shanti Ranjit Kaur, a Senior Customer Service Officer with the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore, admitted in cross-examination that although the respondent was the subscriber of the mobile phone bearing the number 98183928, it was not possible to determine the identity of persons using the phone, whether to place or receive calls. It would also not be possible to determine the identity of persons making calls to that handphone.
Nonetheless, the prosecution invited the court to make the damning inference that the person who received calls to 7334267 and redirected to 98183928, the person who had arranged for customers for PW4`s prostitutes, was the respondent.
The prosecution also had to show that the respondent had received a share of PW2 and PW3`s earnings. PW4 admitted in cross-examination that the person who introduced the customers would get a cut of the fee charged by his prostitutes. He said that on the day he was arrested, the person who introduced his customers was the caller at 7334267. In previous arrangements, the caller at 7334267 would also call PW4 to ask him to go to various places in City Plaza, Singapore, to hand over the cut earned by the caller at 7334267. He said he had handed over money to the driver of a white Mercedes motor car with the digits `8338` in its registration number. Again, the prosecution invited the court to draw the inference that calls to number 7334267 would also be re-directed to the respondent`s handphone 98183928 and that the person who had arranged to receive a cut of the earnings was the respondent.
The prosecution adduced another piece of incriminating evidence in support. In cross-examination of the respondent, the prosecution produced a photograph of a white Mercedes registration number SBD 8338 D. The respondent admitted this was her car. This was intended to show that the person to whom PW4 admitted he paid part of his earnings from the prostitution of his girls - the driver of a white Mercedes with number `8338` - had connection with or use of the respondent`s vehicle. The prosecution invited the learned district judge to infer that the white Mercedes bearing number `8338`, described by PW4 in his evidence, was the same vehicle owned by the respondent.
Still, this it did not necessarily establish that the respondent had received moneys directly from PW4. PW4 stated in his evidence that he had always paid the male driver of a white Mercedes whom he called `uncle`. The male driver of the white Mercedes was not produced. PW4 was emphatic that he could identify the male driver but said that he was not in court. It will be remembered that the respondent`s husband was jointly tried with her. PW4 did not identify the respondent`s husband as the driver of the white Mercedes. It was never established that money handed to the male driver would have found its way to the hands of the respondent.
 The respondent`s denial of the evidence against her
In her s 122(6) statements, the respondent denied the charges made against her. In her long statement, she claimed that the telephone number 7334267 was used by `Anna Beauty Salon` in that she had several free-lance beauticians who would call her periodically to ask for work. She did not have contact numbers for the beauticians. They would contact her - she would not contact them. She would periodically receive calls from customers who would ask for facial treatments. She did not have contact numbers for her customers either. She would then tell a beautician who asked for work to go to that customer`s house to perform facial treatments. She also did not have a place of business. All the services were conducted at her customers` houses. The beauticians would collect the money for the services and bank a share of it into the respondent`s account. `Phoenix Escort Agency` was operated in the same way. Customers would call to ask for escorts, and they would be matched to escorts who called asking for business. The respondent was emphatic that she did not have the contact numbers of either the customers or the escorts. She claimed never to have met any of her employees (meaning the escorts and the beauticians).
She maintained her story in cross-examination. In her examination-in-chief, she again denied arranging appointments for sex with prostitutes. She denied knowing PW2 or PW3 or that she had received any part of their earnings as prostitutes. She also denied knowing PW4. She denied that either PW2, PW3 or PW4 had ever contacted her on 7334267.
The respondent denied having any contact with PW4 or any person using his handphone. The problem faced by the respondent at trial was that in her long statement, she had stated that nobody besides herself used the handphone number 98183928. Had the respondent maintained this story at trial, it would have led to the inexorable conclusion that she was the person making and receiving calls to and from the handphone of PW4. However, when confronted in cross-examination with the telephone records showing numerous calls from her handphone to that owned by PW4 and vice-versa, the respondent said that her friends and relatives would sometimes use her phone.
Over and above the general denial, the respondent also claimed ignorance of the specific calls allegedly made to her handphone via the telephone number 7334267 to arrange for the appointments on 16 April 1996 between PW2 and PW3 (the prostitutes) and PW5 and PW6 (the AVB officers) that led to the arrest, charge and conviction of PW4. Her story was that she had lost her handphone at a coffee shop in Changi a few days before being apprehended on 16 April 1996. This differed from the statement made by her husband to the police that the handphone had in fact been lost by him at Newton Hawker Centre some months earlier. The loss was not reported to the police or the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore. The respondent claimed that she had subsequently recovered the handphone from the person who found it and had paid him a reward. The account for the handphone was then transferred to her husband and the number changed. The number was changed, said the respondent, because she had been receiving nuisance calls.
The respondent admitted having taken out newspaper advertisements but denied any illicitness pertaining to that act. She insisted in her long statement that the wording she wanted was `Facial for men, customers can be local or foreigner, interested telephone 7334267`. When the translation of the actual text was read out to her, she said that the publisher had mis-translated her advertisement. When asked why she did not stop the advertisements, she said that she did not notice it as she could not read Mandarin.
 Elements of the offence
The offence under s 146(1) constitutes four major elements that must be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt: (i). the fact that prostitution has taken place;
 (ii). that earnings have been made from that prostitution;
 (iii). that the whole or part of those earnings or the benefit of those earnings have been received by the accused; and
 (iv). that the accused received those earnings or their benefit with the knowlege that they were earned through prostituion.
 
 
Fact of prostitution
First, there must be proof of prostitution of a person other than the accused. In the present case, both PW2 and PW3 admitted that they were prostitutes. However, whether one is a `prostitute` is a legal question and not one of self-nomenclature. It is necessary to go one step further and to examine whether PW2 and PW3 actually fell within the legal definition of the word `prostitute`.
Reference may be made to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Federated Malay States in 
Koh Ah Peng & Anor v R
 
 
[1939] MLJ 19
  . This case concerned the question whether there was a difference between a `kept woman` and a `prostitute` for the purposes of s 6 of the Women and Girls Protection Ordinance, the statutory predecessor of s 146(1). McElwaine CJ took the view that a prostitute was a woman who offered herself indiscriminately to any man for payment. So long as she was `a woman who is kept habitually by one man and who is chaste in her relations with all other men [and] she cohabits with her keeper to the exclusion of all others`, she was not a `prostitute`.
I was of the view that PW2 and PW3 fell within the definition contemplated by the Court of Criminal Appeal. They admitted that they would attend to any man they were directed to by PW4 and that they would do so in exchange for money. It is necessary to supplement this observation by highlighting two local decisions, 
R v Lee Whoy Khoi
 
 
[1937] MLJ 240
  and 
Lim Hung Tong v PP
 
 
[1964] MLJ 336
  . The result of these two cases is the emergence of a principle that where the only evidence against an accused charged under s 146(1) of the Women`s Charter is the evidence of the prostitute himself or herself, corroboration of that evidence is highly desirable though not required as a rule of law. This principle appears to derive by analogy from the more familiar proposition that the court may presume a woman of immoral character to be unworthy of credit where she is the prosecutrix in an allegation of rape: see s 157(d) of the Evidence Act. However, this question in this case was easily resolved, as the evidence of either prostitute was corroborated by the evidence of the other as well as their pimp, PW4.
However, the first element of the offence was not satisfied merely because PW2 and PW3 were proven to be prostitutes for the purposes of s 146(1). There must be identifiable acts of prostitution. If specific details of prostitution are not available, such as the date, time and parties involved in the illicit activities, it must at the very least be established that: (i). within or around the time frame stipulated in the charge;
 (ii). the person identified as a prostitute has indiscriminately offered his or her body for sex with another person in exchange for money;
 (iii). that those offers have been accepted by a member or members of the opposite sex; and
 (iv). that sexual intercourse between the prostitute and a member or members of the opposite sex has taken place.
 
 
The incorporation of the time element (ie that these matters must be proven to have taken place within or around the time period state in the charge) is to avoid the unwarranted imposition of liability on a person who happens to live off the savings of a former prostitute who has long since ceased to be in that profession.
Earnings must be made from prostitution
The second element of the offence is that there must be `earnings` as a result of the prostitution. If a prostitute offers himself or herself for sex and sex takes place but no money changes hands, then the offence is not made out. Thus, it is necessary to prove that the prostitute has received remuneration for that service, though not necessarily from the person with whom he or she has engaged in sexual intercourse.
Earnings or benefit thereof must be received by accused
The third important element is that the accused person must be living either in whole or in part on those earnings. This may be proved by his or her receipt of such earnings, or alternatively that the earnings of prostitution were applied in support of his or her daily living expenses.
Dealing first with the situation where earnings have been received by the person charged with the offence, I was of the opinion that it is unnecessary to consider the question whether such earnings can be said to have been `received` by the person charged if the money given by the customer to the prostitute is not traceable at common law to the accused. This would be the case, for example, if it has been banked into a mixed fund and money thereafter withdrawn from the bank account to pay the accused person. This would be too technical an approach. I was of the view that the accused person has received the earnings of prostitution, so long as he has received money he would not have received but for the fact of prostitution. It does not matter that this money comes directly from the customer into his hands, through the hands of the prostitute, or as is alleged in this case, through the hands of a third person.
Concerning the situation where the person charged does not actually receive money but accepts food, clothing and housing provided by the prostitute and paid for out of his or her earnings from prostitution, the issues are more sophisticated. This is because the broad wording of the statute lends itself to the construction that a child or sibling being supported by a prostitute is guilty of the s 146(1) offence. Even more far fetched is the scenario in which the prostitute donates some money each week to the beggar sitting in the corridor of her flat. The beggar is also guilty of the offence, provided he knows the donor to be a prostitute. Because this issue did not arise in the present case it was not necessary for me to decide whether there is some underlying mischief which the section was meant to deal with, nor was it necessary for me to proceed to the next step, that is, to develop a test that would allow the section to achieve its purpose without being lent to obvious injustice. However, I have highlighted the matter so that it might not be overlooked in future consideration of s 146.
Accused`s knowledge
The fourth and final element is one of mens rea. The person receiving the money must know that the money or sustenance he is receiving consists of or is derived from the earnings of prostitution. Thus, a man whose wife prostitutes herself is not guilty of the offence in accepting a gift or meal from his wife unless he knows that she earned the money to purchase the gift or meal from her prostitution.
 Summary of evidence
Scant attention was paid to focusing the evidence onto the individual elements of the offence by the trial judge in the court below. Nor was a concerted effort made by counsel in this appeal. I think it is necessary to address the question whether these elements were proved by the prosecution`s evidence.
The fact of prostitution and earnings resulting from it was easy to establish. PW2 and PW3 admitted they were prostitutes. PW4 admitted he was their pimp and that he received money from the services they provided.
What remained to be established was that the respondent had received earnings as well and had done so with knowledge that the earnings resulted from prostitution. The circumstantial evidence against the respondent was fairly incriminating: (i). She admitted that the telephone number 7334267 was used by her businesses and that calls to that number were redirected to her handphone number 98183928. She admitted placing the advertisements in the Chinese newspapers. Even if one accepts that the content of the advertisement was mistranslated and that the respondent did not know this because she could not read Mandarin, it is indisputable that she knew and sanctioned that the person to be contacted for the services was `Miss Anna` at 7334267. The respondent admitted in evidence that she noticed the phone number and that it was correct. She would have been able to read the words `Miss Anna` in the advertisements as these were published in English.
 (ii). PW4 testified he contacted one `Anna` at 7334267 to obtain customers for prostitutes. PW3 testified she contacted `Miss Tan` was 7334267. The respondent`s husband`s surname was `Tan`. PW2 and PW3 both testified it was a female voice who answered 7334267. The respondent did not suggest any identifiable person as someone who could have received and made all the calls from and to PW4`s handphone. There was thus evidence suggesting a nexus between PW4 and the person using the respondent`s handphone (ostensibly, the respondent).
 (iii). The method in which the respondent conducted her escort and facial services businesses was unorthodox, not even retaining contact numbers of clients or employees. The prosecution`s suggestion that this provided a convenient cover for a prostitution ring was not without force.
 
 
The first major weakness in the prosecution`s case was that it could adduce only circumstantial proof that when either PW2, PW3 or PW4 called 7334267 to make the relevant arrangements for the prostitution of PW2 or PW3, the person with whom they dealt was necessarily the respondent. In other words, although PW4 admitted being connected with `Anna`, he did not go so far as to say that `Anna` and the respondent were one and the same person. It is therefore possible that he was in fact obtaining customers from someone other than the respondent who was using the respondent`s phone.
 after 
The prosecution in its closing submissions invited the district judge to infer from the evidence that the identity of the person receiving calls made to 7334267 was indeed the respondent. There was ample basis on which the trial judge could have done so: (i). There was an overwhelming number of calls made from the respondent`s handphone to PW4`s handphone and from PW4`s handphone to the respondent`s handphone or the telephone number 7334267.
 (ii). The calls made between the two phones occurred at all times during the day - meaning either that it was the respondent who answered or made the calls, or that the phone was in the constant possession of some other person who answered or made the calls, or if possession was retained by the respondent, that that person was constantly in the company of the respondent. The prosecution suggested the first alternative was the most likely of the three.
 (iii). Even if one accepted the respondent`s story that she had lost her handphone around the time of her arrest, which seemed convenient for her defence, that would not explain why there were so many calls made between her handphone and that of PW4 even before she lost the phone.
 (iv). If indeed someone other than the respondent had used the phone to call PW4, then the question would have been why she claimed to have exclusive use in her long statement. Even in cross-examination she said that her friends and relatives only used the phone sometimes.
 (v). It would also have been difficult to explain why calls continued to be made from her handphone to PW4`s handphone and vice versa it had been lost, unless one was to infer that the person who found the phone quickly became intensely associated with PW4. The other explanation could have been that the phone was taken by the same friend and relative who used the phone to call PW4 before it was allegedly lost - in which case the question arose as to why the respondent had to pay to recover the phone (she said in evidence she paid a reward to the finder to recover it).
 (vi). A further difficulty in the respondent`s story that the phone was stolen was the prosecution`s suggestion that the call-transfer facility for 7334267 was never disabled, so calls continued to be routed to the handphone even after it was stolen. This was based on the evidence of Inspector Bridget Goh, PW7. This was certainly hard to explain away.
 
 
The weight of the circumstantial evidence supported the inference that PW4 and the respondent were acquainted. However, the fact that I might have come to a different conclusion from the trial judge had I been in his position was not relevant, as I will later elaborate.
Further, the prosecution faced an even greater difficulty in proving that the respondent had received earnings of the prostitution. The trial judge had similarly rejected this suggestion. Again, the difficulty lay in the nature of the evidence against the respondent, principally, the evidence given by PW4. In the present appeal, I considered the proper treatment of PW4`s evidence to be pivotal. First, however, I thought it convenient to summarise the trial judge`s findings.
 The trial judge`s findings
The trial judge found that the offence was not made out against the respondent. He found the respondent to be a credible witness. In his grounds of decision, he said of her:
 
She was cross-examined exhaustively by the prosecution. She withstood the cross-examination. In the court`s view, her evidence was unshaken and the prosecution was not able to adduce any evidence to rebut her evidence. The court accepted her evidence.
 
 
 
The trial judge found that PW4`s evidence showed that the respondent had no connection with himself or the prostitutes. He also found that the prosecution was unable to show that the accused and PW4 were in contact with each other and that the calls made to number 7334267 were attended to by the accused. He therefore acquitted the accused.
 Role of the appellate court
The issue in this appeal was not whether this appellate court, had it been in the trial judge`s position, would have made the inferences that the lower court refused to make, but whether the conclusions arrived at by the trial judge as to the facts proved or not proved were such that no reasonable trial judge would have come to those conclusions. Reference may be made to the decision of the Federal Court in 
Mulkh Raj Sharma v Shanti Sroop
 
 [1983] 2 MLJ 397 
 in which Abdul Hamid FJ, delivering the judgment of the court, stated that:
 
[A] Magistrate cannot ... be said to have erred in law and to have misdirected herself if she, after hearing and seeing the witnesses, had made a conclusion or inference on the basis of the evidence before her after giving due regard to what on balance was the weight of the evidence. In that event a judge hearing an appeal should not substitute his finding for that of the magistrate on those facts unless the conclusion arrived at ... was plainly wrong and any advantage which the magistrate enjoyed by having seen and heard the witnesses was not sufficient to explain her conclusion.
 
 
 
In 
 Sheo Swarup and Ors v King-Emperor 
 1934 AIR 227(2) PC, Lord Russell of Killowen highlighted that, in exercising its power to review evidence and order a reversal of an acquittal, the High Court should always give proper weight and consideration to the following matters: (i). the views of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses;
 (ii). the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial;
 (iii). the right of the accused to the benefit of the doubt; and
 (iv). the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses.
 
 
The obvious advantages enjoyed by the trial judge in being able to observe the demeanour of witnesses before coming to his conclusions whether to accept their evidence means that the appellate court must only reverse those findings when they are obviously unjustifiable. In 
Ameer Akbar v Abdul Hamid
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 113
  , I re-stated the well-established principle that
 
... an appellate court will not usually interfere with a trial judge`s findings of fact which are based on the credibility of the witnesses whom the trial judge had the opportunity to observe when giving evidence. Such findings should be deferred to by the appellate court unless they are clearly against the weight of the evidence.
 
 
 
The prosecution invited me, first, to reject the trial judge`s findings of fact; secondly, to accept the prosecution`s version of the facts and, finally, to draw the following necessary inferences from those facts: (i). that the person who communicated with PW2, PW3 and PW4 at the other end of the line assigned to telephone number 7334267 was the respondent;
 (ii). that the respondent did not in fact operate beauty or escort services out of the businesses registered as `Anna Beauty Salon` and `Phoenix Escort Agency` but that the advertisements for facial treatments were to attract customers for prostitutes and the `escorts` dispatched to those customers were in fact prostitutes;
 (iii). that in answering the calls of PW2, PW3 and PW4, the respondent was connected to PW2, PW3 and PW4 in a fashion that went beyond the accidental, social, casual or innocent, ie that she actively participated in procuring and supplying prostitutes for the customers who responded to her advertisements; and
 (iv). that that the respondent would not do all these things for free, and that she had to have received some benefits in exchange for the effort she had undertaken to arrange sexual services for her customers.
 
 
In considering the prosecution`s invitation, I started by directing myself to two questions. First, what was the proper approach to assessing circumstantial evidence at the close of trial, and secondly, what weight was to be attached to the circumstantial evidence in the present case such that the correct inferences could be drawn from it? I would then have to consider further whether the trial judge`s conclusions were so obviously wrong that the appeal should be allowed.
 Assessing the evidence - the prosecution`s standard of proof
I do not propose to discuss the standard of proof required of the prosecution as it has received extensive treatment elsewhere. The skeletal arguments submitted by the DPP raised one matter that I was compelled to consider, namely, where the facts in issue have not been proved by direct evidence, and the court is asked to infer those facts from circumstantial evidence, may the court infer that those facts in issue are proved if it thinks it more likely than not that those are the correct inferences or can the court only make such inferences if it is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that those inferences are proper?
The DPP in his skeletal arguments highlighted my grounds of decision in the related MA 243/96 - this was the prosecutor`s appeal against the trial judge`s finding that there was no case to answer. It will be remembered that I allowed that appeal and concluded that a 
 prima facie 
 case was made out against the respondent. The DPP appeared to suggest that, since I had accepted his version of the facts in issue for the purposes of calling the defence, I should be like minded in deciding the issue of guilt.
I did not agree with this. I was of the view that I was not in any way bound by my conclusions in MA 243/96 for those conclusions were not an adjudication of the respondent`s guilt. As Lord Diplock stated in the leading case of 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  ; [1980-1981] SLR 73:
 
For reasons that are inherent in the adversarial character of criminal trials under the common law system, it does not place upon the court a positive obligation to make up its mind at that stage of the proceedings whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution has by then already satisfied it beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. Indeed it would run counter to the concept of what is a fair trial under that system to require the court to do so.
 
 
 
The prosecution must, at the end of trial, go beyond what it must show at the close of the prosecution`s case. At the close of the prosecution`s case, the prosecution need only raise a prima facie case which, if uncontradicted by the defence, would justify a conviction. That case could be made out of proved facts or reasonable inferences drawn from the proved facts. The nature of the inferences as to primary facts that must be drawn at the close of the prosecution`s case were described by Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 as follows:
 
for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by s 189(1) the court must act on the presumptions (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation.
 
 
 
For obvious reasons, in deciding the issue of guilt at the close of the trial, this standard will not suffice. The evidence must be subjected to the highest, not lowest standard of scrutiny. The facts proved by the prosecution must therefore satisfy the trial judge beyond reasonable doubt that the correct inference to be drawn from those facts is that the accused person is guilty. The trial judge is not allowed to act on the presumption that the primary evidence is true. Nor is he to make only a minimal assessment - to decide if the necessary inferences `would reasonably be drawn`. He must make a maximum assessment - to decide if he has no reasonable doubt that those are the correct inferences to make. In this regard I would refer to the dicta of LP Thean J, as he then was, in 
Tan Siew Chay v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
  , where, having cited the same passage of Lord Diplock which I have quoted relating to s 189(1) he said: 
 
The application of limb (b) necessarily involves the court drawing inferences from the primary facts, and in drawing such inferences the court looks at the totality of the evidence and considers what inference, if any, that can reasonably be drawn therefrom. But in considering any inference to be drawn the court at this stage does not apply the test whether the evidence looked at in its totality would inevitably and inexorably lead to only one inference or inferences for establishing the essential elements of the charge.
 
 
 
I therefore had to consider the evidence afresh, without reference to my conclusions in the first appeal, which conclusions were premised on a different standard of proof. In applying the maximum assessment approach, the trial judge was not prepared to make the necessary inferences to convict the respondent. The question before me was whether he had erred in so doing - whether that decision was obviously wrong.
 Whether charges made out against respondent
In view of the extensive circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution, it was certainly tempting to reverse the decision of the lower court and to convict the accused.
There was evidence suggesting that PW4 and the respondent had been in communication for the first two weeks of April 1996. It would have been possible, in the light of the evidence of the intensive communication between PW4 and the respondent`s handphone, to infer that they were involved in some activity. The key difficulties lay in determining that the activity was the supply of customers for prostitutes and that the respondent had received earnings from that prostitution. The former requirement - to prove that the respondent had assisted in the prostitution - was not necessary for the purposes of the charge under s 146(1) but only for the purposes of the deeming provision under s 146(3). I will deal with this at the appropriate juncture.
The only evidence capable of directly supporting these infererences were contained in the statement of facts which PW4 had admitted when he pleaded guilty. He was cross-examined on this statement under s 147(1). It is convenient to set out the relevant portions of the statement of facts:
 
 
4 Investigation revealed that between 6 March 1996 and 16 April 1996, the accused [ie PW4] had managed a place of assignation in his m/car SBC 8968 R, Honda. He moved around in the car with the two girls [ie PW2 and PW3] waiting for his customers to contact him through his handphone number 8245913 and pager number 2120456. Sometimes he hang around at the shopping centres at `City Plaza`, Geylang Road, and `Parkway Parade`, Marine Parade Road. He fetched the girls to the customers` place mainly at hotels. He charged the customers $100 per service. The girls received $70 per customer that they serviced and the balance of $30 kept by him. The accused operated his service from 12pm till 11pm. 
 
5 The accused had sent the girls to the hostel as he had received `bookings` from one `Anna` (Liew Kim Choo) for her customers. The accused charged `Anna` $100 per service that his girls provided to her customers. The accused handed `Anna`s` customers money to a male Chinese whom he addressed as `Uncle`, (Tan Choo Peek) at an arranged location. The accused and `Anna` communicated with each other through the telephone line number 7334267. `Anna` and `Uncle` were arrested on the same day.
  
 
 
For reasons which I will now elaborate, I came to the conclusion that it was not possible to draw the inferences from this circumstantial evidence that the respondent supplied customers for PW4 or that she had received the earnings of prostitution. While these might have been proper inferences on the balance of probabilities, I was not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that these inferences should have been drawn.
 The statement of facts
The principal question was to what extent it would have been possible to adopt the statement of facts relating to the charges to which PW4 had pleaded guilty to prove the charges against the respondent. It was arguable that such a statement might be admitted to prove relevant facts, particularly that incriminating acts had taken place during the time period specified in the charges. To sustain this argument, the following propositions would have to be relied upon: (i). A statement of facts to which a person charged with an offence pleads guilty is an admission within the meaning of s 17(1) of the Evidence Act by virtue of s 20 of the Evidence Act which reads that:
 
 
Statements made by persons to whom a party to the suit has expressly referred for information in reference to a matter in dispute are admissions.
 
 (ii). Such a statement is capable of amounting to a `confession` within the meaning of s 17(2) of the Evidence Act. A `confession` is defined as `an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence`.
 (iii). Such a statement, being made by a person in the presence of a magistrate, but whilst in the custody of a police officer, would not be subject to the general rule contained in s 26 of the Evidence Act prohibiting proof of the confession against him.
 (iv). If the person making the confession (that is, admitting a statement of facts) is a witness in subsequent proceedings, he may be cross-examined on that statement under s 147(1) of the Evidence Act if he gives evidence which is inconsistent with his previous statement (ie the confession).
 (v). Where a person has been cross-examined under s 147(1) on a previous inconsistent written statement, that statement may be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act.
 
 
If the statement of facts was indeed admissible, then it would have been possible to adopt it and to draw the necessary inferences concerning the receipt of earnings from that statement, provided that that evidence went uncontroverted. However, I was alive to the possibility that, before so doing, the weight of the statement of facts might be called into question owing to a line of decisions in England and India suggesting that the guilty plea of an accused cannot be evidence against another accused person.
The English authorities have categorised this conclusion as a rule of evidence - that other than in the proceedings in which he has pleaded guilty, a plea of guilt is not evidence that the person pleading guilty has committed those acts. In 
R v John Turner
 
[1832] 1 Mood 347
 , one Sarah Rich confessed to stealing 200 sovereigns from her employer. John Turner was charged with felonious receipt of 60 of those sovereigns. The trial judge admitted Sarah`s confession and, relying on that together with other evidence, convicted John Turner. It was subsequently held that the confession was not evidence against John Turner, and his guilt must be proved by other means. It was further held that even had Sarah Rich pleaded guilty to theft, the guilty plea would not have been evidence against John Turner. The acts allegedly committed by Sarah Rich would have to be proved

In 
R v Moore
 
[1956] 40 Cr App Rep 50
 , the Court of Criminal Appeal comprising Lord Goddard CJ and Hilbery and Byrne JJ held that where two men were indicted together and one pleaded guilty, the fact that one had pleaded guilty was not evidence against his co-prisoner All that could be said was that the co-prisoner had been found in the company of one who had pleaded guilty.
The principle that emerges from these two decisions - that a guilty plea of accomplice A is not good evidence against accomplice B - seems to be a derivative of or corollary to the common law rule that where two co-accomplices are charged together for same or similar offences and tried at the same trial, a confession made by one accomplice is not admissible to prove the guilt of the other: see, for example, 
R v Gunewardene
 
[1951] 2 KB 600
 for this proposition of English law. The position in England is thus that, if A`s confession cannot be used to prove B`s guilt, neither can A`s guilty plea. The scope of the English common law rule against use of co-accused confessions has been the subject of judicial consideration in Singapore.
In 
Chin Seow Noi v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
  , the Court of Appeal considered that the effect of s 30 of the Evidence Act was that where two or more persons are jointly tried for the same offence, a confession made by one accused may not only be taken into consideration as against the other accused person, but that s 30
 
allows the conviction of an accused person to be sustained solely on the basis of a confession by his co-accused, provided, of course, that the evidence emanating from that confession satisfies the court beyond reasonable doubt of the accused`s guilt.
 
 
 
In coming to this conclusion, the court considered that illustration (b) of s 116 of the Evidence Act which reads that `the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution` did not support the proposition that accomplice evidence had to be corroborated before it was safe to convict upon it. Rather, the rule requiring corroboration had been removed by s 135 of the Evidence Act, which reads that
 
An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is hereby abrogated.
 
 
 
Quite clearly, the effect of the 
 Chin Seow Noi 
 decision is to acknowledge that the common law rule against convicting an accused person on the confession of a co-accused when they were tried jointly for the same offence is abrogated by statute, a decision which I was not only bound by but also consider to be on all fours with the meaning of the relevant provisions in the Evidence Act. However, the question whether the abrogation of that common law rule would also abrogate the rule in 
 R v John Turner 
 and 
 R v Moore 
 is quite a separate question, for the rule in these cases refers to the use of a guilty plea (as opposed to a confession) against the accomplice.
It is fair to say that s 135 of the Evidence Act has abrogated the rule requiring a judge to 
 warn himself 
 against convicting one accomplice without corroborative evidence of the other accomplice. However, to say that the 
 Chin Seow Noi 
 decision was attributable exclusively to s 135 would be not only contrary to the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, but would also suggest that s 30 was superfluous. The court relied on both s 135 and s 30 in coming to its conclusion that accomplice evidence was good evidence to secure a conviction.
Section 5 of the Evidence Act provides that all rules of evidence not contained in any written law, so far as such rules are inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Act, are repealed. In other words, common law rules apply unless inconsistent with the Act. The common law rule in 
 R v John Turner 
 pre-dated the Act. It was a decision of 1832 and the rule therefore applies in Singapore unless abrogated by statute. I am of the view that whilst the common law rule against convicting an accused person on the confession of another accused person 
 jointly tried with him for the same offence 
 may have been removed by the combined effect of ss 30 and 135, this was not the case as regards the rule in 
 R v John Turner 
. There is no provision in the Evidence Act prescribing that a person`s plea of guilt is evidence against an accomplice to the crime to which that person had pleaded guilty. There is no corresponding section like s 30 to which s 135 may be mated so as to abrogate the rule. The rule therefore must stand.
In support of this, I was mindful of the consideration that, if I were to take the position that s 135 alone conclusively removed the requirement for corroboration of accomplice evidence in all cases, it would render illustration (b) of s 116 nugatory. Section 135 has to operate in conjunction with s 30 to override the effect of s 116 illustration (b). In other words, illustration (b) of s 116 must be of general application except where the provisions of the Act prescribe otherwise, for example, in the situation before the Court of Appeal in 
 Chin Seow Noi 
. I was not moved to find that the present case was one in which the presumption in illustration (b) of s 116 was inapplicable, the reason being that there is no section which can be matched to s 135 to abrogate the rule in 
 R v John Turner 
.
I hasten to add that, returning to the guiding principles set out in s 5 of the Criminal Procedure Code and s 2 of the Evidence Act that English common law rules apply in Singapore, except to the extent they are inconsistent with statute, the rule in 
 R v John Turner 
 would be qualified if a plea of guilt were relevant and admissible under a statutory provision. Thus, if a plea of guilt (or for that matter a statement of facts) amounted to an admissible `confession` or `admission` within the meaning of the Evidence Act, the operation of the rule in 
 R v John Turner 
 would be precluded as a result. It is noteworthy to add that the rule in 
 R v John Turner 
 and 
 R v Moore 
 now appears to have been legislatively overruled in England by s 74 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which allows proof of the conviction of one co-defendant (including a guilty plea) to be used against another. This conclusion was not available to me in the absence of a statutory equivalent to s 74. I therefore confined myself to the question whether a guilty plea and its attendant statement of facts may be admitted as a `confession` in our law.
The question whether such a plea of guilt does indeed amount to a confession has been treated in Indian law. This issue was touched upon by the Indian High Court in 
 Shyama Charan Bharthuar & Ors v Emperor 
 1934 AIR 330 Pat. The Indian High Court did not couch the objection to the use of a guilty plea in other proceedings so much in terms as a rule of evidence as to come to that basis on an analysis of the conceptual nature of a guilty plea. It seems to have drawn a distinction between (i) confessions, which, being admissions of incriminating facts, are admissible as evidence in all cases where those facts are relevant and (ii) pleas of guilt, which are not relevant to prove facts other than in the proceedings in which the plea is heard.
In 
 Shyama Charan Bharthuar 
, it was argued before the Indian High Court that a guilty plea was a confession for the purposes of the Evidence Act. It was further argued that where a plea of guilt had been illegally accepted by the judge, that confession was irrelevant by virtue of s 24 of the Indian Evidence Act (in pari materia with s 24 of our own Evidence Act). The Indian High Court rejected the contention that:
 
A plea of guilty under s 271(2), Criminal Procedure Code, is a confession such as is dealt with in the Indian Evidence Act in respect of relevant or irrelevance,
 
 
 
taking instead the view that a plea of guilt
 
... is a statement which, if accepted by the court, amounted to a waiver on the part of the accused of trial in which alone a confession might be utilized in evidence.
 
 
 
The analysis of the Indian High Court was therefore that the guilty plea was merely the basis on which the court could dispose of the need to hear evidence in order to adjudicate on the pleader`s guilt. It was effective only in those proceedings. It could not be used in other proceedings as evidence that he had committed those criminal acts.
How does the Indian High Court`s treatment of the guilty plea compare with the Singapore courts` approach to the statement of facts? The starting point is the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
  . In 
 Mok Swee Kok 
, a specially convened Court of Appeal consisting of Yong Pung How CJ, Karthigesu and LP Thean JJA, Lai Kew Chai and Warren Khoo JJ pronounced that:
 
... in our judgment, the recording of a statement of facts by the court following an accused`s plea of guilt, which began as a matter of practice which evolved primarily as a means of assisting judges to determine the appropriate sentence, has evolved into a legal duty on the court to record a statement of facts and to scrutinize the statement of facts for the explicit purpose of ensuring that all the elements of the charge are made out therein.
 
 
 
This statement confirmed for Singapore courts an attitude that was well-established in the Malaysian courts. In 
PP v He King Kiok
 
 
[1992] 2 MLJ 781
  , Selventhiranathan J, sitting in the High Court at Kuala Lumpur, acknowledged that:
 
It has become accepted practice or a salutary unwritten rule of criminal procedure in Malaysia ... for the court to require, in serious cases, an outline or a statement of the facts of the case to be proved by the prosecution so as to satisfy itself that the ingredients of the charge are met and ... that the accused agrees to all the ingredients of the offence and all the averments in the charge.
 
 
 
In that decision, Selventhiranathan J considered the effect of s 5 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code which provides that
 
As regards matters of criminal procedure for which no special provision has been made by this Code or by any other law ... the law relating to criminal procedure for the time being in force in England shall be applied ...
 
 
 
Our own Criminal Procedure Code contains an identical s 5. Selventhiranathan J then went on to adopt as a good statement of Malaysian law the view of the English Court of Appeal in its` Practice Direction [1968] 3 All ER 434 that one of the foremost purposes of the statement of facts was to preserve the right of the press and public to `know the circumstances of the crime for which an accused is convicted and sentenced`. In its Practice Direction, the Court of Appeal considered this purpose to be of equal or greater importance than the need to have a point of reference for determining sentence. The Court of Appeal therefore directed that even in offences for which there is a prescribed mandatory sentence, such as murder, the absence of judicial discretion in deciding sentence does not allow the prosecution to refrain from disclosing a statement of facts. By virtue of s 5 of our own Criminal Procedure Code, this is a also a statement of Singapore law.
How does this compare with the analysis suggested by the Indian High Court? The courts` function in Singapore, Malaysia, India and England is identical. It is protective of the accused person - to ensure that the facts admitted to by the accused disclose the offence to which he has pleaded guilty. In Singapore, Malaysia and England there is an element of public disclosure to reinforce this protective function, namely, the pronouncement of the statement of facts. However, in these four jurisdictions the court`s legal duty to ensure that the statement of facts discloses the elements of the charge does not require the court to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the facts stated therein took place. The facts contained in the statement of facts are not proved facts. Rather, the court is entitled to presume upon those unproved facts for the purposes of convicting and sentencing the accused person.
When a court presumes upon the facts stated, the accused`s plea of guilt and admission to the statement of facts operate in a way as an estoppel 
 in those proceedings only 
 - and I wish to emphasise that I use that word for convenience without any intention to refer to the legal doctrine associated with it. The accused is not permitted to appeal against his conviction but only his sentence, although a court exercising its revisionary jurisdiction may acquit him of the offence in certain circumstances: see 
 Mok Swee Kok 
. This is one aspect of the statement of facts that is readily identifiable with the reasoning in 
 Shyama Charan Bharthuar & Ors v Emperor 
. In both India and Singapore, the guilty plea and statement of facts are not formal evidence against the accused. They are merely devices relied upon by the court in convicting the accused. Provided the accused is aware of the nature and consequences of his plea, no investigation into the truth of the plea of guilt or the statement of facts is undertaken. The truth of the statement of facts is uncontrovertibly presumed for the purpose of convicting the accused. This does not, however, `estop` the accused from denying that statement in separate proceedings.
In deciding whether or not a statement of facts amounts to a confession for the purposes of our laws, in particular whether it can be used as evidence in other proceedings, the decision of the Indian Court of Appeal in 
 Shyama Charan Bharthuar 
 is less instructive. This is because the Indian courts, unlike the courts of England, Singapore and Malaysia, do not require the prosecution to adduce a statement of facts as a rule of practice. Instead, the accused is invited to plead and to make a statement. An Indian court is thereupon under a duty to satisfy itself by putting questions to the accused in order to see whether he is aware of the facts on which the charge is founded against him and also whether he has admitted his guilt voluntarily without any extraneous pressure or expectation of lenient sentence.
The absence of a statement of facts from the Indian system may explain why the bare plea of guilt is not viewed as a confession in that country. The proposition that a bare plea is an `admission ... stating or suggesting the inference that [the accused] committed that offence` carries less force compared to the proposition that a statement containing the material particulars of an offence and admitted to by an accused person amounts to a confession under s 17(2) of the Evidence Act. The wording of s 17 is wide enough to catch the statement of facts if not the bare plea of guilt.
I therefore took the view that the statement of facts, properly classified as a confession for the purposes of s 17, was a statement made by PW4. It was a statement on which he could properly be cross-examined under s 147 of the Act. I also found that if such a statement was properly proved against him, the statement could be used as proof of the facts stated therein by virtue of s 147(3) of the Act which reads that
 
Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.
 
 
 
There was, however, nothing magical about the conclusion that PW4 had, by virtue of his plea of guilt and admission to the statement of facts, confessed to the facts stated therein. Unlike in 
 Chin Seow Noi 
, s 30 did not apply in the present case to elevate the confession to the level of evidence upon which a conviction of the respondent could solely be based - this was not a joint trial of co-accused persons charged with the same offence. PW4 and the respondent were tried separately. Because of illustration (b) of s 116, PW4`s evidence had to be treated with caution.
In coming to this conclusion, I was persuaded by numerous factors which militated against treating an accused person`s statement of facts as evidence which could, on its own, convict the accused`s accomplice: (i). There were reasons why a person might plead guilty and admit to a statement of facts even though he was innocent and the statement of facts untruthful. These reasons include (a) a very strong prosecution`s case which might be premised on evidence that is difficult to rebut; (b) a belief that it is better to plead guilty in the hope of a light sentence rather than to risk conviction and a heavier sentence; (c) his having been advised by his lawyers to plead guilty because they believe the likelihood of his conviction to be strong although he is not actually guilty; and (d) the accused falling outside of the category of persons eligible for legal aid and yet being unable to afford expensive legal representation, especially in complex cases.
 (ii). The statement of facts is not in fact prepared by the accused or even prepared based on an interview with him. It is made by the investigation officer or Public Prosecutor based on the evidence they have against the accused. The accused person does not sign the statement of facts. The statement of facts cannot therefore be accorded the same weight as a statement made to the police. Furthermore, a suspect is unlikely to make a false confession to the police unless he was under duress or threat. This contingency is provided for by statutory provisions excluding the proof of such confessions. However, a suspect may falsely plead guilty for the reasons I have set out. As a false guilty plea can only be reversed by revision, the only safeguard is to subject such pleas to careful scrutiny so that their proper weight can be determined.
 (iii). Furthermore, as I have said, the judge`s duty in accepting the statement of facts is not to scrutinise every detail to make sure that it is accurate. He is only required to be certain that the accused has admitted all material particulars to the offence. See the judgment of LP Thean J, as he then was, in 
Chota bin Abdul Razak v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 77
  ; 
[1991] SLR 675
 in which my learned friend held that:
 
 
If what he admits contains all the ingredients that constitute the offence and what he disputes or does not admit is irrelevant or immaterial to the offence, such an admission ... is sufficient ... and the court should accept his plea of guilty.
 
 
 
However, it goes without saying that details which are not material to the accused person`s conviction may be material to the conviction of an accomplice. In the present case, the statement of facts admitted to by PW4 contained details which incriminated the respondent, namely, that PW4 had paid money which he received from the prostitutes to a male driver of a white Mercedes (ostensibly, the respondent`s agent). However, these details, although greatly probative of the respondent`s guilt in the present appeal, were not relevant to the charges against PW4 and had these details been inaccurate, the statement of facts would not have been objectionable for the purposes of PW4`s conviction. To then proceed upon those potentially inaccurate and unproved facts in prosecuting the respondent would be unsound as that part of the statement of facts may be false but taken for truth. It would then be unsafe to hang the respondent`s conviction on the thread of the `immaterial` parts of PW4`s statement of facts.
I therefore considered that the statement of facts had to be treated with great circumspection. Whilst it contained particulars material to the charges against PW4 which were also relevant to the charges against the respondent - for example, the fact that PW2 and PW3 were prostitutes, that they had prostituted themselves between 6 March 1996 and 16 April 1996 for money, and that they had received money for sexual services and given some of that money to PW4, the critical allegation that PW4 had passed on money to the respondent was not a material particular for the purposes of PW4`s plea of guilt.
This allegation, contained in the statement of facts, was the only evidence suggesting that the respondent had received the earnings of prostitution. It was, moreover, not only circumstantial evidence, but also evidence disputed by PW4 when examined in chief by the prosecution and again by counsel for the respondent in cross-examination. The weight of the statement was further diminished because it contained inconsistencies even within itself. In para 4 of the statement, it was alleged that the customers were charged $100 for sex of which PW4 retained $30 and the girls retained $70. However, in para 5, it was alleged that `the accused [ie PW4] charged `Anna` $100 per service that his girls provided`. This suggested that Anna was paying PW4. In para 5, it was alleged that `The accused handed Anna`s customer`s money to a male Chinese whom he addressed as Uncle`. This suggested the reverse position, that PW4 was paying Anna. Further, if, as it was alleged, that PW4 charged $100 for services, which was divided into shares of $70 (for the girl) and $30 (for himself), what, if at all, would he have remitted to Anna?
Compounding these difficulties with the forcefulness of the trial judge`s findings of fact that PW4 was to be believed on his assertion that he had no connection with the respondent, I was not prepared to find that the respondent had received the earnings of prostitution. It could not be said that the trial judge was obviously wrong in deciding as he did. In conclusion of my analysis of the usefulness of a statement of facts in other proceedings, I reserved my opinion on the question whether, had the respondent and PW4 been jointly tried, and s 30 had applied, the statement of facts would be subject to the same degree of scrutiny I had subjected it to.
 The deeming provision
One final point deserved consideration. This concerned s 146(3) of the Women`s Charter which provides that:
 
Where any person is proved to live with or be habitually in the company of any prostitute or to have exercised control, direction or influence over the movements of any prostitute in such a manner as to show that the person is aiding, abetting or compelling her prostitution with any other person or generally, the person shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be deemed to be knowingly living on the earnings of prostitution.
 
 
 
The prosecution did not seek to rely on this provision notwithstanding the difficulties in their case. Nonetheless, I thought it appropriate to consider whether this deeming provision should be applied in the present case to circumvent the prosecution`s failure to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent had received the earnings of prostitution. If it were to apply, then the fourth and final element of the offence might be presumed unless the respondent proved otherwise on a balance of probabilities.
For the deeming provision to take effect, the prosecution must have proved beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent either (i) lived with or was habitually in the company of any prostitute or (ii) exercised control, direction or influence over the movements of any prostitute in such a manner as to show that the respondent aided, abetted or compelled her prostitution with any other person or generally.
The first alternative was not part of the prosecution`s case.
Insofar as reliance on the second alternative was concerned, the only evidence of this was the assertion contained in PW4`s statement of facts that he had obtained customers through the respondent. The only other possible evidence was that of PW2 and PW3 that they contacted a person at 7334267. Even if we assumed that this person was the respondent, PW2 and PW3`s evidence was that they informed this person that they had arrived at the designated premises. This did not prove that the respondent had controlled, directed or influenced their movements, although it might fairly be said that the respondent had an interest in their movements.
As such, I was again presented with the predicament of whether to reject the trial judge`s findings based on his observations of the witnesses in favour of the unreliable statement of facts. Although on the evidence I was prepared to accept that many phone calls took place between PW4 and the respondent, those phone calls would be innocent unless it was proved that PW4 had obtained customers for prostitutes during those calls. Otherwise, it could not be said that the respondent had controlled, directed or influenced the movement of the prostitutes.
The character of these telephone calls could only be tainted by the allegations in para 5 of the statement of facts that PW4 had obtained customers for his prostitutes from the respondent. However, as with the allegations concerning the receipt of earnings, these allegations were totally irrelevant to the charges against PW4 but were of critical importance to the charges against the respondent. The statement of facts was therefore of diminished weight insofar as it could be applied to attribute an illicit character to the telephone conversations between the respondent and PW4. I was therefore of the opinion that the prosecution had not proved the necessary facts to bring the deeming provision into effect. The prosecution thus had to prove the fact of receipt of earnings independently, which, as I have already discussed, they failed to do.
 Conclusion
At its very highest, all that could be said of the prosecution`s case was that it proved that there were two prostitutes, PW2 and PW3, who had, between 6 March 1996 and 16 April 1996, prostituted themselves under the direction of PW4, and that it was 
 possible or likely 
 that PW5 had assisted in the arrangements and that it was 
 possible or likely 
 that she had received money for it. However, in view of the difficulties I have already discussed at length, I was not prepared to find the charges against the respondent proved 
 beyond reasonable doubt 
. I therefore dismissed the appeal of the public prosecutor.",1997-08-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

This is an action in passing off and it concerns two words `Millennia` and `Millennium`. It is a 
 quia timet 
 action. The plaintiffs are the developers of a S$1.65 bil project at the Marina Centre consisting of two hotels, two office blocks and a shopping mall (hereinafter called `the complex`). To ensure that it would be a development of distinction, they commissioned three world-renown US architects to design it.
The defendants are a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and own numerous hotels in different parts of the world, four of which are in Singapore. The defendants are a substantial company and a subsidiary of a public listed company in Singapore.
Initially the plaintiffs intended to name the development `Beacon Place`. On 3 November 1992 the plaintiffs wrote to the Advisory Committee on Street Names to say that they wished to change the name to `Millennia City` or `The Millennia`. On 5 October 1993 the plaintiffs informed the Advisory Committee that it would like to have the name `Millennia` spelt with only one `n`. On 24 November 1993, the Advisory Committee gave its approval to the plaintiffs to call its complex the `Millennia`.
On 28 March 1994 the plaintiffs filed four applications with the Registry of Trade Marks (RTM) to register `Millennia` as a service mark in four classes, including one for `hotel services` under class 42, having earlier established from searches at the RTM and the Registry of Companies that no other person had applied to register `Millennia` or a similar name as a service mark for similar services or as a company or business name for similar businesses.
On 11 July 1994 the plaintiffs announced to the public by way of a press release that the complex would be named `Millennia`. This news item was carried in the media the following day. On that day, advertisements were also placed by the plaintiffs in the newspapers announcing and promoting the `Millennia` name.
On 12 July 1994 an Operating Agreement was entered into between the plaintiffs and the Ritz-Carlton Company of Atlanta, USA (R-C Co), an international hotel management chain, appointing the R-C Co to be the operator of one of the two hotels in the complex. Under cl 7.2.3 of the Operating Agreement, the plaintiffs has the discretion to add one other name to the name `Ritz-Carlton` as the name of the hotel.
On 14 September 1994, the plaintiffs informed the R-C Co that they proposed to name the hotel `Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore` (RCMS). The plaintiffs said the reason for wanting to insert the name `Millennia` as a part of the name of the hotel was their desire to retain their goodwill in the name `Millennia` on the expiry of the Operating Agreement with R-C Co, so that, in that eventuality, the hotel will not be left without a name.
I should at this juncture add that though both the hotels in the complex are five-star hotels, the RCMS is of a superior 5-star, sometimes referred to as a 6-star hotel or a super-deluxe hotel. The second hotel, which has since the completion of the trial opened for business, is operated by another international chain, the Conrad.
On 17 October 1994, a topping-off ceremony was held for RCMS. It was graced by the Minister of State for Trade and Industry. Many other prominent people were also invited to witness the occasion. The event was carried in the media the following day where the name Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore was made known to the public.
Sometime on or about 22 September 1995 the plaintiffs came to know that the defendants had on 9 December 1994 filed a service mark application No 10667/94 for the word `Millennium` in respect of `hotel services, hotel accommodation services.` On 27 September 1995, the plaintiffs` solicitors Drew & Napier (D&N) wrote to the defendants demanding that the latter cease and desist from using the Millennium name and withdraw their service mark application. In their letter D&N stated, inter alia, the following:
 
... The words Millenia and Millennium are confusingly similar visually as well as phonetically. Further, if the Millennium mark is used on hotel services, the public may be misled into assuming that there is a trade relationship between our clients and your clients, when that is not the case.
 
 
 
On 29 September 1995, Allen & Gledhill (A&G) for the defendants asked for time to seek instructions and requested the plaintiffs to hold their hands. On 3 October 1995, D&N issued a reminder asking for a response by 13 October 1995 and stating `in the interim, however, your clients should not take any further steps to promote or use the Millennium mark.`
On 10 October, A&G replied, but in two letters. One was marked `Without Prejudice` and the relevant part reads:
 
We wish to inform you that our clients will be launching their Millennium chain of 
 overseas hotels
 on 17 October 1995 in Singapore. The launch is basically an official public announcement to introduce our clients` hotel Millennium Broadway in the United States, and our clients two hotel properties in New Zealand known as Millennium Christchurch and Millennium Queenstown. 
 The launch is not in relation to any Millennium hotel in Singapore
 ...
 
 
 
We would add that this is in no way an admission of your clients` rights to the name in Singapore ... [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In reply to this letter D&N stated that they did not understand why the letter should be marked `Without Prejudice` and added that they would treat it as an open letter. They stated that they would not apply for interlocutory relief in view of what was stated therein but would proceed to do so if the defendants should attempt to `launch a hotel under the mark Millennium in Singapore.`
In the second letter, which was not marked `Without Prejudice` A&G made the following points: (i) that the name `Millennia` is not the name of the plaintiffs` hotel; it is `The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore` indicating that the name `Millennia` is really a location; (ii) that the plaintiffs have not acquired reputation/goodwill in the Millenia mark for hotel services; (iii) that Millenia is a common English word, no monopoly could be acquired and (iv) that the words `Millennium` and `Millennia` are visually and phonetically dissimilar.
It seems to me that the defendants had cleverly asked their solicitors to write the `without prejudice` letter in a manner which would throw the plaintiffs off-guard. The material distributed at the launch, which I will revert to later, clearly shows that the launch related to their Singapore hotels as well: `... there are also 23 Millennium Partner Hotels which will be converted to full-fledged Millennium hotels over the next 18-24 months ... the 23 include three in Singapore`. When confronted, A&G stated on behalf of the defendants that what happened was not a launch of a hotel in Singapore under the name Millennium - `The Singapore hotels are still known as Orchard Hotel, Harbour View Daiichi, and King`s Hotel. The ""Millennium Partner"" programme is a strategic brand alliance that will allow Millennium Partner hotels to take immediate advantage of the Group`s global marketing, reservations and sales networks.` More will be said of this matter later.
On 17 October 1995 the defendants launched in Singapore the Millennium Hotels and Resorts as the international global brand which would eventually link up its entire stable of about 55 hotels in 11 countries. Immediately the defendants` hotels in Singapore would be known as Millennium Partner hotels. The `Millennium` would be a four-star brand.
 Relevant date
The classic form of misrepresentation giving rise to an action in passing-off is a misrepresentation by the defendant that his goods are the goods of the plaintiff. But that is no longer the only form of passing-off. It is passing-off to misrepresent that one`s business is that of the plaintiff, or connected with that of the plaintiff, in any way likely to cause damage. As stated by Romer LJ in 
Clock Ltd v Clock House Hotel Ltd
 
[1936] 53 RPC 269
 :
 
... no man is entitled to carry on his business in such a way or by such a name as to lead to the belief that he is carrying on the business of another man or to lead to the belief that the business which he is carrying on has any connection with the business carried on by another man.
 
 
 
and more recently by Lord Diplock in 
Warnink v Townend & Sons
 
[1979] AC 731
 at pp 741-742:
 
where although the plaintiff and the defendant were not competing traders in the same line of business, a false suggestion by the defendant that their businesses were connected with one another would damage the reputation and thus the goodwill of the plaintiff`s business.
 
 
 
If a trade name suggests that the defendant`s business is an extension, branch or otherwise connected with the plaintiff`s business, the plaintiff could have a remedy in passing-off: 
Ewing v Buttercup Margarine Ltd
 
[1917] 2 Ch 1
 . But the connection must be one by which the plaintiff would be taken by the public to have made themselves responsible for the quality of the defendant`s goods or services: 
HP Bulmer Ltd v J Bollinger SA
 
[1978] RPC 79
 at p 117 per Goff LJ.
In any passing off action a plaintiff must establish (i) goodwill; (ii) misrepresentation; and (iii) actual or potential damage. In the words of Lord Oliver in 
Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc
 
[1990] RPC 341
 :First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies ... Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff ... Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a quia timet action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant`s misrepresentation ...
Before I proceed to examine these essential elements there is a preliminary point which I need to address. It is the relevant date on which the plaintiffs must show they have acquired goodwill in the name `Millennia`. Counsel for the defendants has argued that the date must be 9 December 1994, the date on which the defendants applied to register the service mark.
For this purpose it is necessary to determine what is really the complaint in the amended statement of claim. Having regard to paras 13, 14, 17-24 therein (and I do not propose to set them out), it seems to me clear that what the plaintiffs are complaining of is the defendants` use or clear intention to use the mark `Millennium` on their three hotels in Singapore and not the filing of the defendants` service mark application. It was the launch of the Millennium mark on 17 October 1995 that the plaintiffs are complaining about because in the publicity material handed out to invited guests, the Singapore hotels, namely, King`s, Orchard and Harbour View Daiichi, were identified as Millennium hotels. As mentioned above, this is not an action on trademark infringement but on passing-off. It is true that the plaintiffs have also prayed for an order that the defendants withdraw their service mark application. But that is purely consequential.
The first time that the plaintiffs had any inkling that the defendants might be thinking of using the word `Millennium` to identify their chain of hotels was in September 1995 when the plaintiffs came across the August 25-31 1995 issue of the 
 Travel Trade Gazette 
 which reported that the defendants were `expected to launch its own hotel management company - Millennium - later this year.` Following this the plaintiffs instructed their solicitors to carry out a search at the RTM. The search revealed that the defendants had filed a service mark application on 9 December 1994 in respect of the word `Millennium` for, inter alia, `Hotel Services` in Class 42.
Thereafter there was the correspondence between the solicitors which I have outlined above. As mentioned before, the letter of 10 October 1995 marked `Without Prejudice` was deliberately written in a manner calculated to induce the plaintiffs not to apply for ex parte reliefs, knowing if the whole truth was told, that the launch of the Millennium name had also to do with their hotels in Singapore though the hotels would not immediately be called for example `Millennium Orchard`, the plaintiffs would certainly have applied for interlocutory reliefs, which might (I emphasise the word `might` and I could put it no higher than that) place in jeopardy their launch scheduled for 17 October 1995. From the documents distributed to the media and invited guests on the occasion, it is clear that the name Millennium launched that day was also related to the three hotels of the defendants in Singapore - King`s, Orchard and Harbour View. They would come within the chain. The only difference is that they would not immediately be called for example, Millennium King`s, until renovations were carried out. I should mention that the defendants also own a fourth hotel, the Novotel Orchid Singapore, but that does not come into the picture because it is currently being managed by another international chain - the Novotel.
In this regard, I must state I have some reservations as to the way in which the defendants` solicitors responded to the plaintiffs` solicitors. It was clear that the defendants did not want the launch scheduled for 17 October 1995 to be disrupted. They therefore instructed their solicitors to write with that objective in view. Of course the solicitors wrote in accordance with instructions. Even Edmond Ip, the executive director of the defendants, had to admit (NE309) that the statement `that the launch was not in relation to any hotel in Singapore`, was a half-truth.
There is some evidence that before 17 October 1995 there were reports, mainly in foreign journals and newspapers (though available in Singapore), that the defendants might be adopting `Millennium` as their global brand. The evidence before me shows that the plaintiffs only knew of this in September 1995 and I am quite convinced, knowing how concerned the plaintiffs were of the name for the complex, that if they had known earlier that the defendants would use `Millennium` as their global brand they would certainly have raised it earlier with the defendants.
In my view, the relevant date on which the plaintiffs must prove that they have acquired goodwill in the name `Millennia` was on the date of the alleged infringement - 17 October 1995. That was the date on which the plaintiffs could have any cause of action in passing-off. With respect, I think it is wholly unreasonable to suggest that the relevant date is the date on which the defendants applied to register the mark `Millennium`. Up to 17 October 1995, the general public had no knowledge that the defendants had made the application. There was no announcement from the defendants. I wonder how the defendants expected the plaintiffs to know. What surprised me about the attitude of the defendants was that they expected the plaintiffs to know that the defendants had applied to register the word `Millennium` and yet when they themselves applied to register `Millennium` they made no effort at all to ascertain (which would normally have been done) if anybody else had registered the word `Millennium` or similar such words before them.
The complaint in this action is really that the defendants` three hotels will be known immediately as Millennium Partner hotels and later as Millennium Orchard etc. The offending act occurred on 17 October 1995. As a matter of law, on the authorities, the relevant date for determining whether the act of the defendants amounts to passing-off is the date on which that act commenced: see

 Goodwill
In 
IRC v Muller
 
[1901] AC 217
 , at pp 223-224, Lord Macnaghten described goodwill in the following terms:
 
It is a thing very easy to describe, very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old fashion business from a new business at its first start ... However widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates.
 
 
 
In the same case Lord Lindley expressed himself as follows (at p 235):
 
Goodwill regarded as property has no meaning except in connection with some trade, business or calling. In that connection, I understand the word to include whatever adds value to a business by reason of situation, name and reputation, connection, introduction to old customers, and agreed customers, and agreed absence from competition, or any of these things, and there may be others which do not occur to me.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs` case is that the complex, of which RCMS formed a part, is a unique property, sitting on a choice piece of land at the Marina area and designed by three world-renown architects. The name `Millennia` was chosen because they wanted a distinctive name to identify this extraordinary development. The court was told how they picked this name, that Mrs Donna Naomi Kwee, the wife of the director and President of the plaintiffs, came across it in the 
 Ryrie Study Bible 
 and how she felt it was apt to use it to name the development. Let me say that I accept Mrs Kwee`s evidence. She comes across to me as a truthful witness. Evidence was given on how they obtained the approval of the Advisory Committee on Street Names to name the development as `Millennia`, the plural form of the word `Millennium`, and how one `N` was dropped to `flaw` it and make it more distinctive, so that the word `Millennia` would have only eight letters, eight being an auspicious number to the Chinese.
The plaintiffs claim that goodwill exists in the name `Millennia` for the entire complex consisting of hotels, shops and offices. Three buildings in the complex also retain the word `Millennia` as part of their names - Millenia Tower (an office block), Millenia Walk (the shopping mall) and Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore (RCMS). They say the goodwill in the name `Millennia` extends to all the three component businesses situated in the complex. They rely on a number of foreign examples to make their point and just to cite two of them, the Hyatt Kingsgate in Sydney and the Hyatt Central Plaza in Bangkok, where both hotels are situated in a mixed development comprising hotel and shopping centre. There is some evidence to suggest that those two hotels are also called `The Kingsgate` or `The Central Plaza`.
It seems quite clear to me that the plaintiffs have developed and promoted the project as one integrated whole consisting of hotels, shops and offices. They did so even before R-C Co was appointed to manage the hotel. This was how Arthur Kiong, the director of Sales & Marketing of RCMS and previously a senior executive with Hyatt, described the individual elements of the Millenia complex worked in a synergistic relationship.
 
I will stress the fact that the RCMS is part of the plaintiffs` Millenia complex, which includes Millenia Walk, a high end shopping mall very much in the style of Rodeo Drive in Hollywood. I regard the fact that the RCMS is part of the Millenia complex as being a major selling point. Guests are prepared to pay a premium for proximity to high-end shopping areas, and office space. The latter is important because most of our targetted guests come to Singapore specially to hold business meetings with their local counterparts. The idea is that a high quality tenant at Millenia Tower will lead persons who wish to meet that tenant to stay at the conveniently located nearby high-quality hotel (RCMS). The elements of Millenia Singapore work in synergy.
 
 
 
In his evidence, Mr Arthur Kiong explained why it was necessary to add the name `Millennia` to Ritz-Carlton and here again I quote from his affidavit evidence-in-chief:-
 
... it is common that owners and operators share the hotel name. The rationale is simple. If the owner of the hotel allows the operator to name the hotel with only the operator`s name, the operator would effectively hold the owner at ransom. If the operator were to leave, the owner would be left with a nameless hotel. The owner would have to start marketing efforts afresh, to name his hotel and acquaint the public with the new name.
 
 
 
Rather than under(going) this process, it is common for hotel owners to include in the hotel name their own name, or a name selected by the owner to signify his ownership. Then if the operator were to leave, the goodwill generated in the owner`s name will still be there for the owner to exploit.
 
 
 
Evidence was also adduced as to the special features of RCMS, that every guest room is at least 120 feet above ground level and every bathroom has a commanding view of the surrounding marina areas. The directors of the plaintiffs spared no efforts to make it one of the best hotels in the world and attended to every detail. They took personal interest in the interior finishes, fixtures, fittings, furnishings and artwork in the rooms to ensure that the rooms are really top-class. The unique features of RCMS are highlighted in the collaterals (publicity material) produced for the hotel. Thus, the `Millennia` name is to signify the style, class and taste of the entire complex, in short the quality. Edouard Gremlich, the CEO of the defendants from November 1993 to June 1995 and now the CEO of a related company, accepted that the hardware of RCMS is very special and that a person who has seen RCMS may see `Millennia` as a qualifier, setting it apart from the other Ritz-Carltons.
It is clear to me that the plaintiffs were looking for a distinctive name for their unique project. I accept the plaintiffs` evidence that if at the time they had known that the defendants had chosen `Millennium` for their hotel brand the plaintiffs would not have adopted `Millennia` as the name for the complex. The plaintiffs` solicitors did a search before applying to register the `Millennia` name.
 Publicity on `Millennia`
I now turn to examine the efforts made to publicize and promote the name `Millennia`. There was a clear advertising and promotion strategy. In the first half of 1994 there were the press advertisements on Millenia`s `M` logo, using the teasing method to attract public`s attention to what the `M` stood for, namely, hotels, shops and offices. On 11 July 1994, it was formally announced that the development would be called `Millenia Singapore`. In the press release the plaintiffs explained `Millenia fully captures and conveys the high level of quality and classic, timeless design of the project ... we sought an identity which would convey values of quality, stability and longevity.` It further clarified that the `M` logo `embodies three floating elements in a synergistic relationship reflecting Millenia`s separate yet interrelated projects.` The launch was carried in the 
 Straits Times 
 and the 
 Business Times 
 the next day, 12 July 1994, wherein the public was informed that the complex was called `Millenia Singapore`.
In a full-page coloured advertisement in the 
 Straits Times 
 also on 12 July 1994, the `M` logo was presented with the description, `It`s the tallest office tower in Marina Centre. It is a Super-Deluxe Hotel with the largest rooms in Singapore. It`s an innovative shopping mall, full of light and space. It`s a five-star Hotel perfectly appointed for business. It`s Millenia.`
In another advertisement in the same newspaper on the same day, the following, inter alia, appeared:
 
At the very heart of Marina Centre, MILLENIA SINGAPORE is rising to reshape the city skyline ... MILLENIA comprises four distinctive buildings on a landmark 20 acre (8 hectare) site ...
 
 
 
The super-deluxe hotel features the largest standard guestrooms in Singapore. Every room is at least 550 sq ft, and will enjoy panoramic views, not only from the room but from the bathroom as well.
 
 
 
The Deluxe hotel (now operated by Conrad International) is ideally situated and is a 5-star hotel for business ...
 
 
 
These four unique distinguished buildings combine in a synergistic relationship.
 
 
 
On 14 July 1994 another advertisement appeared in the 
 Straits Times 
 showing a picture of Millenia Singapore featuring the super-deluxe (RCMS) hotel and Millenia Tower in the foreground and the deluxe hotel in the background. It also bore the same description as that which appeared two days earlier.
On 14, 22, 29 March 1995, 4, 11, 18, 26 April 1995, 3, 11, 17, 24 and 31 May 1995, advertisements appeared in the 
 Straits Times 
 promoting the Millenia Tower and it included the following description `Millenia Tower ... part of the Millenia Singapore development, which also features 300,000 sq ft of shopping at Millenia Mall and two 5-star hotels, including the Super Deluxe Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore.`
In a brochure entitled `Millenia Singapore - Singapore`s vision of Quality`, the Millenia Walk was described and promoted as a component of the Millenia Complex. In it the following description of the RCMS appears: `Equally striking is the Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore. The lowest guestroom floor in the 32 storey hotel sits 35 metres above ground over an elegant barrel-vaulted lobby, featuring a unique translucent glass designed to glow at night and create the impression of a floating structure ...`
In July 1995 Arthur Kiong distributed `fact sheets` and a `Fact Book` to the various International Sales Offices (ISO) of R-C Co with instructions to them to start selling rooms in RCMS. The `fact sheet` and `Fact Book` highlighted the unique physical features of RCMS.
In August 1995 a pre-opening brochure on RCMS was published in 12,000 to 15,000 copies and distributed worldwide in the first half of September 1995. The brochures were distributed to travel agents, travel media and overseas customers. An earlier brochure was published and distributed in January 1995.
During that period R-C Co also took an active part in promoting RCMS. In a letter dated 31 August 1995 to the plaintiffs, Mr Jim Dichiara, Vice-President of Sales at R-C Co stated, inter alia:
 
Starting on 15 September 1995 the following tag line will be included on all internal and external correspondence promoting the hotel - `The Ritz Carlton, Millenia Singapore, opening in January 1996 will be the showpiece of Marina Centre ...`. It is conveniently located next to Suntec Convention Centre and is just minutes from Orchard Road. The 32 storey, 611-room hotel will have the largest guestrooms in Singapore, all with breathtaking views of the harbour.
 
 
 
From 15 October 1995 a series of advertisements were placed on the local television introducing the Millenia Walk. Of course, in addition to what have been referred to above, there was the media publicity given to `Millennia` and `RCMS` on the two launches (on 11 July 1994 and 17 October 1994) as well as on other occasions. These are exhibited in the affidavit of Susan Lim, a Vice-President of the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs have also adduced evidence to show that many famous designer boutiques have taken up shopping space at the Millenia Walk. DFS, an anchor tenant, would open its world`s largest store there. Guess? boutique would also be setting up its flagstore there. It was and is targetted to be a world class shopping centre, of the same class and distinction as the Rodeo Drive of Los Angeles, California.
Evidence was also adduced to show that the Millenia Tower is a top class office building, in terms of location, access, general service, rental, and the large column-free area of each floor. The first reservation for offices at Millenia Tower was received in April 1994 and the first confirmation received on 29 July 1994. On the date of the formal launch of the Millenia Tower, 50% of the office space had been taken.
It is not disputed that by the time this action was instituted, the plaintiffs had spent over $1m in advertising and promoting the hotel-office-shopping complex as a whole.
As mentioned before, under the Operating Agreement, the plaintiffs are allowed to add an additional name to the hotel besides the name `Ritz-Carlton`. In conveying their decision to the R-C Co as to the name, the plaintiffs explained `This is to project a consistent image of the Millenia name we have been promoting for our project at Marina Centre.` In reply R-C Co stated that the chosen name `The Ritz-Carlton Millenia, Singapore` posed no problem and added that it `will certainly assist us in the local community`. This last comment is of course significant.
The defendants have argued that in determining whether goodwill has been established in the case of a business not yet started only paid advertisements should be reckoned. I do no think the law has laid down any restrictions as to how goodwill may be acquired. Advertising in the press and other media is of course an obvious means and perhaps the most expeditious means. But if there are reports in the media extolling the virtues or excellence of a service I fail to understand why that should be disregarded. I would have thought the important thing is what is the message that is being conveyed, not whether the owners pay for the media`s space or time. It is the message that counts. If the press or a periodical should do a write-up on RCMS arguably, in terms of goodwill, that could even be better than a paid advertisement. The publication of brochures and material could also generate goodwill. The launch of the Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore on 17 October 1994 could just as much help to establish goodwill, at least among those invited guests, who were people from the industry or people who had an interest in the project or were influential. Similarly, the news coverage of the event would have brought to the attention of the general public the name the complex and what the name of the super-deluxe hotel would be called. Of course in each case the critical question is to determine whether cumulatively what has been done is sufficient to establish reputation/goodwill which will give rise to a cause of action in passing-off.
 Fancy or descriptive
I will now turn to consider the question whether the word `Millennia` is a descriptive word. It is clear that the word `Millennia` is the plural form of the word `Millennium`, meaning a 1,000 years. I do not think that the omission of an alphabet `N` in `Millennia` per se is of much significance. I must, however, observe that while on the one hand the defendants say that the word `Millennia` is descriptive yet on the other hand they have applied to have the word `Millennium` registered as a trade mark which requires that it be distinctive (see s 10(1) of the Trade Marks Act). The defendants, according to their evidence, have made a lot of effort to pick `Millennium` as their global brand name. They wanted something distinctive. Yet they deny that the word `Millennia` is distinctive. The defendants are being inconsistent.
While Millennia may be an English word, I do not think in the context it is wholly a descriptive word. It has no reference to the character or quality of offices, hotels or shops. It may have a connotation of longevity or a new era. It is quite unlike `cleaning services` in 
Office Cleaning Services Ltd v Westminister Window and General Cleaners Ltd
 
[1946] 63 RPC 39
 or `building information centre` in 
Hornsby Building Information Centre v Sydney Building Information Centre
 
[1977] 140 CLR 216
 or `oven chips` in 
McCain International Ltd v Country Fair Foods Ltd
 
[1981] RPC 69
 or `vacuum cleaner` in 
British Vacuum Cleaner Co Ltd v New Vacuum Cleaner Co Ltd
 
[1907] 2 Ch 312
 , which are obviously descriptive. I can understand that a person who uses a descriptive name should not have an unfair monopoly as it might even deter others from pursuing the occupation which the word or words describe. But such is not the position here. Then is Millenia a fancy word? A fancy word is one which has no obvious relevance to the character or quality of the goods or business in relation to which it is used. Of course whether a word is fancy or descriptive may depend on how it is used. Whether a word is termed descriptive or fancy, the significance lies in the fact that distinctiveness is very much more easily acquired for fancy words. Whatever it is, at the end of the day, the crucial question is still this, and I can do no better than quote 
 Wadlow on the Law of Passing Off 
 (at p 392):
 
However, the decision to categorise a word as fancy or descriptive is only one part of the wider issue of whether there is a material representation to restrain. Inherent ability to distinguish is always a matter of degree with there being a continuous spectrum between the highly fanciful and the obviously descriptive. Wherever the name may fall on that range, what matters is whether the name is distinctive in fact.
 
 
 
In the context of the spectrum referred to by Wadlow, I would be inclined to think that the name `Millennia` lies somewhere in the middle, perhaps closer to being highly fanciful than obviously descriptive.
 Goodwill only in `Ritz-Carlton`?
Another substantial point made by the defendants is that Ritz- Carlton is a well-known international hotel operator and from the way the name of the hotel as well as the logo are presented in all stationery, articles, and advertisements of the hotel, it could be seen that the name of the hotel is being promoted as Ritz-Carlton, with the name Millenia indicating the location. This perception is further reinforced by the comma that appears before the word `Millennia`. It is contended that if it was conceived that the word `Millennia` should form a part of the name, the comma should appear after the word `Millennia`. There is a need for me to deal with this point at some length. Just one observation as a reminder at this juncture. The plaintiffs` case is that they have acquired goodwill in the name `Millennia` for the entire complex, including the hotel component.
It is not in dispute that the R-C Co is a deluxe hotel operator, quoting the words of Edouard Gremlich `top of the line`, having started in the United States about 12 years ago. R-C has a growing presence there. Its hallmark is its old world charm. The number of hotels it operates has increased steadily, including some which are outside the United States. However, at the time when R-C Co was appointed by the plaintiffs, it operated only one hotel in the Far East and that was in Hong Kong. The Ritz-Carlton Seoul had yet to be opened (in early 1995) and it is not as well designed as the Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore. The R-C Co operates two hotels in Sydney, Australia. It has no presence in Japan though it has a sales office there. The Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong is a rather small boutique hotel, with only 200 rooms.
Thus, at the time the R-C chain had an extremely limited presence in the Far East, nowhere compared with Hyatt or Hilton. I find it was little known generally. By being associated with the Millenia complex, the Ritz-Carlton chain would be improving its image in this part of the world. I accept the evidence of Arthur Kiong that Ritz-Carlton was and is using the infinitely superior features of RCMS to establish the Ritz-Carlton`s presence in the Far East region. I would imagine that if the physical structure of the hotel did not meet with their requirements or standards, RC Co would most likely not want to be the operator. The hotel building in Millenia gives the image and prestige that the R-C Co seeks and more. Arthur Kiong clarified that (NE135) `Millenia is the qualifier to distinguish this hotel from the other traditional Ritz-Carlton so that people who come here will not be surprised.` In my view, this was the main reason the R-C Co was willing to allow the name `Millennia` to be inserted alongside Ritz-Carlton as the name of the hotel.
Of course this is not to say that there is no benefit to the plaintiff having Ritz-Carlton as the operator. There must be. Arthur Kiong gave two reasons (NE135): `the reason why an owner of a new hotel building requires affiliation is the sales promotion and networking. Furthermore, from the point of view of attracting talents, the affiliation gives more scope of advancement to staff.`
In the hotel industry, the R-C Co does not have the same strong commanding position as say Hyatt. Thus even the appointment of Arthur Kiong was subject to the approval of the owners, the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs did not leave everything to the operator as they took a hands-on approach to the whole project. This is borne out by the fact that Arthur Kiong was told by R-C Co that the hotel is an exceptional product, the owners were very interested in it and that he should be sensitive to the two names Ritz-Carlton and Millenia. I accept the evidence that the object behind the plaintiffs` insistence of having the name `Millennia` in the name of the hotel was to signify its extraordinary features and to distinguish it from the other Ritz-Carlton hotels.
Accordingly, as of the date R-C Co was appointed by the plaintiffs to be the operator of the hotel, I do not think the name `Ritz-Carlton`, in so far as Singapore was concerned, was any more well known than `Millennia`. On the contrary, I think the name `Millennia` could be better known then because from early 1994 the plaintiffs had been publicising the name `Millennia` and its logo. On the evidence I find that the R-C chain was certainly not that well-known outside the US, where it had the bulk of the hotels within the chain and even there it had only a short history. In Europe, no hotel bears that name though the Arts Hotel in Barcelona, Spain was and is being operated by the R-C Co.
There is no evidence that the R-C chain had advertised in Singapore before the publicity material put up by the plaintiffs for RCMS. The defendants have produced no such evidence. Kunil Kang (for the defendants), a hotel magazine publisher in Japan, has asserted that the R-C chain has advertised in Japan. While there is a dispute if this is proven, as no documentary evidence was produced to substantiate that assertion, the figures of RCMS show that (exh `P3`) out of 26,880 room nights at RCMS (for the first quarter) only 997 originated from Japan, an obviously insignificant proportion.
From the evidence before me, there is no doubt that the publicity material on the RCMS centred on its physical attributes, its style and flair, which are different from the normal Ritz-Carlton hotels which are generally of the old world, and on the fact that it formed a part of the overall Millenia complex with a high-end shopping mall and offices. Here the court has the evidence of Arthur Kiong that he has been selling RCMS in a somewhat different manner from the norm adopted by other R-C hotels. He described it in his affidavit as follows:
 
One of the main selling points of any hotel is its character. Millenia is used to differentiate the plaintiffs` hotel from typical Ritz-Carlton charactertistics. The Ritz-Carlton connotes boutique, Victorian-style hotels. In selling the plaintiffs` hotel I used `Millennia` to distinguish the plaintiffs` hotel and describe how this hotel is different. Much in the same way that a `Mercedes` connotes a well engineered sedan, when I add the words `Mercedes Sports` the latter word changes the picture completely. The listener now has an impression of a sporty car. The `Millennia` in the plaintiffs` hotel name has the same effect: to portray the unique selling characteristic of the hotel. By character I refer to a host of tangibles and intangibles ...
 
 
 
Arthur Kiong has also requested the International Sales Offices (ISO) of R-C Co to market RCMS in similar vein. In July 1995, he sent a fact sheet to the ISOs where the words `Millenia Singapore` were larger than the words `The Ritz-Carlton` and where the RCMS was described as `the centrepiece of the Millenia Singapore complex`. It went on to elaborate the physical attributes of the hotel. Also sent was a related publication called `
 The Fact Book 
` where the hotel was referred to as `Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore`.
Then there was the pre-opening glossy brochure of 12,000 to 15,000 copies on the hotel which was published in August 1995 and was distributed worldwide in the first half of September 1995. This brochure focused on the architecture and the location of the hotel, with a description of the entire complex and of the breath-taking view which each of the rooms in the hotel offers.
The plaintiffs took a direct interest in the marketing of the hotel and this can be seen from Arthur Kiong`s request to the ISOs for monthly reports: `Your feedback will be helpful in our monthly report to our owners, who are understandably concerned about how the hotel is being marketed overseas` (exh AK24 dated 6 October 1995).
I referred earlier to the letter dated 31 August 1995 which Jim Dichiara, Vice-President Sales of R-C Co wrote to the plaintiffs. The emphasis in the letter was on the hardware. Moreover, it is not the policy of R-C Co to dictate sales efforts from headquarters. At 12 DB3120 we see the following statements: `The (R-C Co`s) marketing organization is decentralized. The hotel marketing staff is in the best position to observe, assess and capitalize on marketing opportunities unique to their hotels ... The RCHC believes that it is the function of corporate sales and marketing to support the hotel marketing department in every way`.
I find it was the intention of the plaintiffs that the name of the hotel should have two components, `Ritz-Carlton` and `Millennia`. There are various ways of looking at the comma between those two names. Even taking the worse interpretation, that on account of that comma it could be argued that what follows indicates a location, the fact remains that the full name of the hotel is `Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore`. In spoken form the comma will not come into the picture and will be totally irrelevant.
Furthermore, it does not necessarily follow that just because `Millennia` is the name of a complex that others could simply copy and adopt that name if goodwill existed in the name `Millennia` on the relevant date. I agree with the plaintiffs` submission that it is important not to confuse a development name with that of a street name or name of a district like Bishan or Ang Mo Kio.
In Singapore we see quite a number of such development names, eg `the Centrepoint` and `the Nee Ann City`. It is only in the broadest sense can it be said that `Millennia` is the name of a location, if one takes location to mean a place or building or complex. As I see it, `Millennia` is not a geographical name but a name identifying the plaintiffs` complex, a quality complex. This is unlike the Australian case 
Snyman v Cooper & Ors
 
[1990] 16 IPR 585
 where what was involved was clearly a geographical name. There the plaintiffs carried on business as a florist at a shop unit at Indooroopilly Shoppingtown, Indooroopilly, Queensland. The business was known as `Shoppingtown Florist` at Indooroopilly. Indooroopilly Shoppingtown was a very large and well-known shopping centre which was first opened in 1970. The defendant registered, inter alia, a business as `A Aarons Florist Indooroopilly` and advertised it in the Brisbane Yellow Pages as being located at Indooroopilly Shoppingtown. It was this advertisement that gave rise to the action. At no time did the defendant have a florist shop physically situated at Indooroopilly. Plaintiff`s business was affected by the advertisement. The case concerned an alleged infringement of a provision of the Trade Practices Act 1974. It also raised the issue of passing-off. There the learned judge found that `the geographical location alone of the applicant`s business is not entitled to protection from competition by another trader. If a trader, being the first to establish a business in an area, was by that fact alone entitled to claim a monopoly in that area, free competition would be severely stifled.` He also stated that it was very difficult to make out a case for passing-off in respect of the use of a merely descriptive or geographical name.
So on the evidence have the plaintiffs established goodwill in the name `Millennia`? My answer is in the affirmative. The plaintiffs have acquired goodwill and reputation in the name `Millennia` in respect of the complex, where offices, shops and RCMS are located. It does not follow that business has to be around for sometime before goodwill may be acquired. Of course the longer the period, the stronger the case. As the brief discussion that follows will show, even a short period could establish goodwill. All the more so in this modern age of mass communications, a trader should be able to establish goodwill sooner.
 David Young on Passing Off 
 (3rd Ed) states that `it is not possible to say how long it is necessary for a name or get-up to be used before the trader acquires a reputation or goodwill sufficient to bring a passing-off action. The time required will depend on how distinctive the particular name or mark is and to what goods or business such name or mark is applied.`
A couple of cases will illustrate that. In 
McAndrew v Bassett
 
[1864] 33 LJ Ch 561
 though the plaintiff`s product had only been on the market for six weeks, the court held that goodwill was established. Even three weeks was held sufficient in 
Stannard v Reay
 
[1967] RPC 589
 involving a mobile fish and chip van called `Mr Chippy`. In 
BBC v Talbot Motor Co Ltd
 
[1981] FSR 228
 which concerned a car radio for traffic information `CARFAX` and had yet to be launched, the court granted interlocutory relief on the basis of advanced publicity.
In contrast in 
County Sound plc v Ocean Sound plc
 
[1991] FSR 367
 , six months` use of the name `The Gold AM` for a radio programme was held insufficient for the plaintiff to have acquired a secondary meaning in such a descriptive name. In 
Licenced Victuallers` Newspaper Co v Bingham
 
[1888] 38 Ch D 139
 , which concerned a periodical called `The Licenced Victuallers` Mirror`, three days was held to be an insufficient time to acquire sufficient reputation to prevent a paper from using the same name. But in that case no prior advertisement publicizing the name of the new periodical was made. On the date the defendants published their allegedly infringing paper, only a small number of the plaintiffs` periodical was sold.
Another pertinent case is 
Fletcher Challenge Ltd v Fletcher Challenge Pty Ltd
 
[1982] FSR 1
 where the plaintiff, a public company, was incorporated in New Zealand as a holding company for three substantial companies pursuant to a scheme of amalgamation. The proposal for the amalgamation was submitted to the shareholders of the three companies for approval and wide publicity was given in New Zealand to the proposal and that the holding company would be called `Fletcher Challenge Ltd`. At about that time two individuals incorporated the defendant-company. Thus, when the plaintiff applied for a reservation of its name, it was refused because there was likely to be confusion. The plaintiff commenced proceedings to restrain the defendant from carrying on business under the name `Fletcher Challenge`. Powell J, in the circumstances, held that the plaintiff had established reputation: it had the combined goodwill of the three constituent companies or, alternatively, the announcement of the proposed amalgamation and the proposed holding company created a new reputation for the plaintiff.
I also find that reputation/goodwill has been acquired for RCMS. The defendants concede in their closing submission that 
 some 
 goodwill in the full name RCMS may have been acquired by October 1995. A review of some of the pertinent evidence will substantiate that finding. The first reservations for rooms in RCMS came in at about the beginning of April 1995. As of 27 October 1995, the date Susan Lim affirmed her affidavit in these proceedings, 2,840 room nights had been confirmed and tentative bookings for 14,021 room nights had also been received. There is evidence that by September 1995 local people had also made various enquiries to book the facilities of the hotel. Exhibit `P3` shows that in the first three months, 2,191 room nights came from Singapore. Sixteen percent of all guests were Singaporeans. The occupancy at RCMS during the first quarter was good unlike the Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong or Ritz-Carlton Seoul. I accept the evidence that this was due not just to the Ritz-Carlton brand name but also the physical attributes of the hotel, in respect of which the name `Millennia` is meant to signify. I think it likely that the locals went to stay at the hotel to experience the outstanding features of RCMS of which so much publicity had been generated. Arthur Kiong had also personally shown to travel agents the attributes of the hotel so that they could better sell the hotel. As for those who booked from overseas there is evidence that some local representatives did view the product on behalf of visitors from overseas.
There can be no better testimony for the goodwill of the hotel than the fact that within five months of its opening RCMS was voted the best new hotel in the world. This could not have come about wholly on the strength of the Ritz-Carlton brand. If that were so, why didn`t the other Ritz-Carlton hotels win such an accolade? It would be fair to say that there is uniformity in the quality of services rendered in each Ritz-Carlton hotel. I am persuaded that in this case it was the outstanding physical attributes of RCMS and the special promotional efforts made by Arthur Kiong and his marketing team that made the difference and clinched the award. This is the `Millennia` factor. There is evidence that the hotel was able to show a profit within a month of the opening. This again indicates a high degree of pre-opening goodwill generated no doubt by the promotional efforts which highlighted the Ritz-Carlton service and the Millenia extraordinary features.
In this regard, another question that arises for consideration is whether it is necessary that RCMS must have opened its door for business before goodwill may be acquired. RCMS opened its door to receive the first guest on 18 January 1996 though, as mentioned before, bookings had been received much earlier, the first as early as in April 1995. It is pertinent to note that the defendants themselves claimed goodwill for their two New Zealand hotels even before they were opened and this claim of goodwill was based on the fact that they had been promoting the Millennium brand for three to four months before the opening of those hotels. The defendants, accordingly, had to admit through Edmond Ip, that if RCMS had been promoted before it was opened, there would be goodwill in the full name. Ip admitted that by October 1995 RCMS had acquired goodwill in its full name.
It is true that goodwill is normally acquired by trading. But it does not follow that where trading has not yet commenced, goodwill may not be acquired. As a matter of principle I do not see why if a trader has embarked on pre-trading marketing efforts like advertising and promotion, goodwill may not be built on account of that publicity. Of course, if a purely descriptive word is used then more must be shown before it can be said that the name has acquired a secondary meaning.
In 
Turner v General Motors
 
[1929] 42 CLR 352
 the plaintiffs were a newly incorporated Australian subsidiary of the well-known American motor manufacturers, established to assemble cars in Australia. Plaintiffs engaged in heavy advertising to publicize themselves. These prompted the defendants to set up a second-hand car business as General Motors before the plaintiffs had begun to trade. The High Court of Australia affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and granted an injunction.
An early English authority, 
Maxwell v Hogg
 
[1867] 2 LR Ch 307
 held that trading must actually have commenced before there could be any cause of action. There the plaintiffs extensively advertised a new magazine to be called `Belgravia`. Before the first issue appeared, the defendants hastily brought out a magazine of his own under that name, using material originally intended for other magazines of his. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs could have no rights to the name until the first issue of his magazine appeared and that he had been successfully pre-empted by the defendants.
 Maxwell v Hogg 
 seems to have been followed in 
Chivers v Chivers
 
[1900] 17 RPC 420
 where the plaintiffs` actual trade was confined to a limited area within England though advertisements were circulated more widely. Farwell J, in refusing to take the latter into account, said: 
 
Advertisement, distinguished from trade, is nothing. No doubt if you have the trade and advertisement assists the trade, but to say that a man can by advertising alone make his name known in connection with particular goods as to assist him in obtaining a monopoly of those goods seems to be untenable as a proposition.
 
 
 
However this restrictive approach appears not to have been followed by the Court of Appeal in 
Chelsea Man v Chelsea Girl
 
[1987] RPC 189
 where it granted an injunction extending outside the three towns in which the plaintiffs had retail shops. In 
BBC v Talbot Motor Co Ltd
 
[1981] FSR 228
 which concerned a car radio for traffic information CARFAX, the court granted interlocutory relief even though it had not yet been launched but publicity had been given.
More recently, 
 Maxwell v Hogg 
 seem to have been applied in 
Marcus Publishing plc v Hutton-Wild Communications Ltd
 
[1990] RPC 576
 where both the plaintiffs and defendants were preparing to issue magazines under the title `
 Leisure News 
` but neither had yet produced its first issue. Both magazines were intended to be distributed free and to derive revenue from advertising. The Court of Appeal held no goodwill had been established by either party. The case concerned an application for interlocutory injunction. One must bear in mind the facts and Dillon LJ summarized them in one paragraph as follows:
 
In the present case all that the defendants had done in relation to this name, before this action had begun, was to advertise and make it known that they were going to issue a magazine, without indicating the name, to approach a number of possible advertisers, mentioning the name, and to effect a first sale of advertising space. The plaintiffs, in relation to their 
 Leisure News
, had done virtually no more. I should perhaps have mentioned the defendants` sending out of a sales brochure, but that is mere advertisement; it takes matters no further. Nor does the plaintiffs` sending out of their pilot issue.
 
 
 
Dillon LJ did not really rule out completely that pre-publication activity could confer goodwill as he went on to say that `even if pre-publication activity could confer goodwill, what little had been done by either party is far too insignificant to qualify them to establish goodwill in a name consisting of ordinary words in the English language.` Thus the decision in 
 Marcus Publishing 
 must be viewed in its proper context.
I do not think that in this day and age when we are coming to the end of the present century and bearing in mind the advances made in communication technology and the modern methods of doing business, we should still be bound by decisions based on trade practices of the last century. The law must respond to and move in tandem with the needs of the times. The law must meet the challenges of modern day business.
Even if I were wrong to have departed from 
 Maxwell v Hogg 
 in the present case, it is clear from the evidence that on 17 October 1995 the business of Millenia Singapore had commenced. Tenants had taken up premises at the Millenia Tower and at the Millenia Walk. As for RCMS bookings for rooms were received well before the 17 October 1995. Let me illustrate my point by an example: if a play is scheduled to be performed in three months` time and publicity has been given to it and bookings have started to come in, can it seriously be argued that the business has not commenced and that someone else can just simply stage a play using the same title or colourably similar title?
I accept the point that the public is likely to abbreviate RCMS and merely call it Ritz-Carlton. But I think from time to time the name Millenia will come up. It will also be mentioned because of the Carlton Hotel, to distinguish between RCMS and the Carlton Hotel. Nevertheless, the fact that the public will abbreviate does not mean the full name RCMS or `Millennia` loses its goodwill. Edmond Ip agreed that abbreviation does not detract goodwill. That must be so. Let`s take the fourth hotel of the defendants `Novotel Orchid Singapore`. It is from time to time abbreviated as `Novotel`. I am sure the defendants are not thereby suggesting that their goodwill in `Orchid` has disappeared. I was referred to the examples of the Borobodur Intercontinental at Jakarta which is sometimes called the Borobudur, and the Hyatt Central Plaza in Bangkok which was commonly known as `The Central Plaza`. Nearer home we had previously the Century Park Sheraton (now changed to Ana Hotel). It was sometimes called `Century Park` and sometimes just plain `Sheraton`. As the defendants` expert, Mr Thomas Baum, quite rightly noted, there are `relatively few absolute rules in hotel names.`
 Confusion
I now turn to consider the second element, confusion. Let me repeat. The plaintiffs` case is the following. The words `Millennia` and `Millennium` are phonetically and visually similar. As both the plaintiffs and defendants are in the hotel-shopping-office business, the public are likely to be confused into believing that one business is related to the other or that both are one and the same business or belong to the same group. The public are likely to think that RCMS belongs to the defendants` chain of Millennium hotels or that the RCMS is operated by the defendants` Millennium chain or vice-versa.
In my view there is no doubt that the two words are phonetically and visually similar and that the public could be mistaken about them. It is of interest to note the following statement in para 142 of 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed): `The first syllable of a word is regarded as more important than the second or subsequent ones, and it has been recognised that there is a tendency in the English language to slurring the ends of words.` The defendants` assertion (made through their solicitors) that the two words are visually and phonetically dissimilar is unsustainable; nothing could be further from the truth. Thus, when Gremlich and Edmond Ip gave evidence they had to admit that the words are similar. It is also of interest to note that when Arthur Kiong applied for a job with RCMS he wrote `Millennium` rather than `Millennia`. The same confusion was made by a tenant of Millenia Tower. In a 
 Straits Times 
 article of 7 September 1995 the reporter wrote that the GUESS? boutique would be located at the `Millennium`. There is admittedly the distinction between the two words which Professor Michael Joseph Alexander, a professor of English Literature, sought to draw. But, in my view that is the sort of distinction which an ordinary person would not be able to make or have in mind.
It would be noted that the plaintiffs` position is that they enjoy goodwill in the name `Millennia` for their complex. There could be passing-off even if the parties are not in direct competition. Of course, if they are in the same business all the more so confusion is likely to occur.
So are the defendants in the same business? Counsel for the plaintiffs made the point that the defendants` majority shareholder, City Development Ltd, is a public-listed property developer which owns office buildings and shopping facilities. But can it be said on that account that the defendants are in the business of providing offices and shopping facilities? It was argued that commercial reality must be borne in mind. However, the fact remains that the two companies are distinct legal entities with separate shareholdings. I have some reservations whether we can justifiably lump the businesses of the two companies into one for the purposes of a passing-off action. I would be inclined to think that the fact that the group to which the defendants belong also engages in the business of providing offices and shopping facilities is neither here nor there. Moreover, we are not here concerned with two complexes (consisting of hotel-shops-offices) which have similar sounding names. There is obviously nothing wrong with two groups of companies being engaged in similar businesses.
The defendants` Orchard Hotel has an adjacent shopping centre called Orchard Hotel Shopping Arcade. Counsel for the defendants has on his clients` behalf given an undertaking that they would not be using the word `Millennium` to name the Shopping Arcade. Furthermore, an innovation has taken place at the Harbour View Hotel. There the defendants have converted a portion of the car park into serviced offices. Such offices, which are small, are being made available to the public for short term leases. Here again the defendants have given an undertaking that the brand name Millennium would not be used on the serviced offices. For the purposes of this judgment, I do not think I need refer to or rely upon any of these two undertakings.
During the trial I was informed that the defendants` hotels would be named in this form `Millennium Orchard Hotel` `Millennium King`s Hotel` and `Millennium Harbour View Hotel`. So the question is whether there would be any likelihood of confusion with RCMS or the Millenia complex if the defendants` hotels are so called. The following is the evidence of Gremlich in cross-examination:
 
 
Q: So even to a wise traveller there is a possibility that in his mind there is a relationship between the plaintiffs` hotel and the defendants` hotels? 
 
A: Possibility is there. However, I do not believe a traveller is concerned who owns the hotel. 
 
Q: By referring to your three hotels as Millennium Partner Hotels a person might conclude there is a relationship between the plaintiffs` hotel and the defendants` hotels? 
 
A: There is a possibility.
  
 
 
Because the defendants will have three Millennium hotels in Singapore, the public here and elsewhere might well think that the RCMS also belongs to the same group or chain. It is true the public will not be concerned with who owns RCMS. That is not the point. The point is about perception of relationship. It is telling that when Mr Neil Hucksteppe, the defendants` Senior Vice-President for Marketing, saw Arthur Kiong in Chicago on 19 September 1995 at a travel trade show, and on knowing that the plaintiffs` hotel would be named RCMS, joked how the locals would pronounce RCMS and went on to say that `people will think you are part of us.` I would add that many a serious matter is uttered in jest. It is understandable why Hucksteppe laughed - the defendants are having an advantage at the expense of RCMS. The defendants have not called Huchsteppe to explain himself.
The defendants tried to argue that in Singapore there is a tolerance of similar sounding hotel names. I do not think there is sufficient foundation for that assertion. To illustrate the point by referring to (i) `Marina Mandarin` and `Mandarin Singapore` (ii) `Meridian Orchard` and `Meridian Changi` and (iii) `Holiday Inn Crown Plaza` and `Holiday Inn Park View` is not helpful as in each of those instances the two hotels are managed by the same operator. You can also add to the list `Shangri-la Hotel` and `Shangri-la Rasa Sentosa`. Obviously if two hotels wished to be managed by the same chain they must be taken to have agreed to any confusion that might arise. The only instance which 
 seems 
 to support that assertion is `Orchard Hotel` and `Orchard Parade Hotel`. But `Orchard` is the name of a very well known road in Singapore. Unless a person can show long user, in other words that the name has acquired a secondary meaning, he cannot claim monopoly to that name; even so, slight difference could be held to be sufficient to differentiate: see 
 Office Cleaning Services 
, supra.
There is just one other comparison which I should refer to. Situated along Bras Basah Road is the Carlton Hotel. In my view there could be confusion in the sense of perception of there being a link between Carlton hotel and the RCMS as the word `Carlton` is common. I have been informed that the plaintiffs have obtained the consent of the owners of the Carlton Hotel to the plaintiffs` hotel being called RCMS. I could understand why Carlton Hotel consented, as RCMS is superior to the former. I would imagine that the answer would likely be different if RCMS is of the same class or inferior to that of Carlton Hotel.
The case involving the Oriental Singapore is interesting. That hotel is managed by `Mandarin Oriental` of Hong Kong. It decided not to use the name `Mandarin Oriental` in order to avoid confusion with The Mandarin (at Orchard Road) and the Marina Mandarin. The hotel is simply called `The Oriental`, omitting the name `Mandarin`. There is evidence (that of Mr Michael William, the former General Manager of the Oriental and admissible under s 32 of the Evidence Act) that people had gone to stay at The Mandarin (at Orchard Road) thinking that it belonged to the Mandarin Oriental Group. There was confusion in people`s thinking that the Mandarin Singapore belonged to the same group as Mandarin Oriental.
I accept the views expressed by Michael Williams that hotel guests do not easily distinguish or readily understand the difference between hotel properties with similar sounding names. A guest may expect hotels with similar-sounding names to be associated in some ways. If there is any doubt as to the standard of service provided because of the confusion, the traveller, especially the business traveller, will just put it out of his consideration. If a traveller hears that Millennium King`s is a 3-star hotel and if he entertains doubts whether RCMS is related to Millennium King`s, he will simply book into somewhere else where he is certain rather than making further inquiries. Not every travel agent abroad would know the true position. The code used for each chain would not really assist in removing any confusion or misconception. The code is only used when booking is made through the various global distribution systems (GDS). It cannot help to identify the hotel to be booked.
Furthermore, there is no evidence before the court as to the number of reservations (worldwide) made through GDS and what percentage it constituted compared with all other forms of booking. There is no evidence of the extent of the use of GDS in Singapore and in the other parts of Asia. I am prepared to accept that the trend will be that more and more reservations will be made through GDS, bearing in mind the evidence of Gordon Stevenson (witness for the defendants) that the cost of processing a reservation manually is US$10-11 whereas that for electronics is only US$2-3. Interestingly, the statistics (exhs P3 and P4) show that in so far as RCMS is concerned only 7.1% of reservations came through GDS. Bookings from Asia accounted for 84%. The point was made that a more direct approach to hotels by travel agents could end with better rates for clients than having to pay the standard rates set out in the GDS. In any case, I recognise that the GDS is only a `means of conveyance`. The fact that there is GDS does not mean there will not be confusion.
I have mentioned above that as on 17 October 1995, the Ritz-Carlton name was no more well known in Singapore than Millenia. It would only be known by people who had visited a foreign city where they had come across a Ritz-Carlton hotel or heard about it or read about the chain in a foreign magazine. The vast majority of Singaporeans (and others living in a country or city where there is no Ritz-Carlton hotel) would not have known of R-C. So Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore could be understood as being managed by the Millenia chain. A person who has tried Millennium Orchard may not try RCMS thinking that it belongs to the same chain or management.
It is also argued that in view of the difference in room rates applicable at RCMS and those at the defendants` hotels, no one would be confused. In my view this argument based on price differentials clearly cannot hold and is fallacious. Let me illustrate. If a one-star Harbour View Hotel is set up anywhere else in Singapore, are the defendants saying there would be no confusion and they would not be entitled to sue and restrain that person from calling his hotel by the same name?
Finally, I ought to refer to the survey done by Ms Nicola Sinclair for the plaintiffs to determine whether the general public would think there is a link or connection between RCMS and the defendants` hotel if they are called Millennium hotels or Millennium Partner hotels. It shows that a substantial number of people were confused. An even larger percentage was not so sure. Criticisms were made by the defendants` expert Ms Marion Jobson on the methodology Sinclair adopted in carrying out the survey. She was criticized for not carrying out some sponstaneous awareness questions on the respondents. In my view this criticism is not justified. At the time the survey was conducted `Millennium Orchard` or `Millennium Partner Hotel` had not yet come into existence because of this action. The object of the survey was a more restrictive one - to gauge the reactions of the public just from the names per se. The aim of the survey was not to establish whether there was goodwill in the name `Millennia`.
There is also the criticism that questions 2b-e in the questionaire were not fairly formulated and were leading. I cannot really accept that. I do not think they suggested any particular form of response. They are broadly fair. Other criticisms relate to (i) questions 3a-e, that they were slanted; (ii) the conduct of the survey and the supervision of the interviewers; (iii) the meanings of certain words; and (iv) the fact that verbatim answers were not maintained. However, Ms Sinclair accepted one criticism of Ms Jobson: that respondents who answered `none of these` to Q2b and Q2c should not be pushed further to answer subsequent questions.
As I see it, the survey done by Ms Sinclair was fairly simple; it was short and uncomplicated. It covered 611 people, representing a cross-section of the public who could be using the hotel services. The interviewers were trained. There was adequate supervision of the answers recorded by the interviewers. The allegation that the interviewers did not conduct the survey according to instructions is pure speculation. Ms Jobson agreed that there are no set rules for a proper survey. She also admitted that if a survey were to be carried out in accordance with the method advocated by her, it would not necessarily produce the correct result.
All said, the results of the Sinclair survey do show how the respondents perceived the synonomity of the two words `Millennia` and `Millennium` though at the relevant time there were no Millennium Partner Hotels or Millennium Orchard etc. In this regard, I am mindful of the following passage of Dillon LJ in 
Mothercare UK Ltd v Penquin Books Ltd
 
[1988] RPC 113
 :
 
Those who organised the survey were rightly careful to avoid asking leading questions, but the result was that those interviewed were asked an unnatural question in an unnatural surrounding. The fact that some of the ladies, in such circumstances, on seeing the cover of the book though of Mothercare and thought that there might be some connection between the book and Mothercare falls a long way short, in my judgment, of proving any basis for asserting that the title of the book involves a misrepresentation as to the source of the book or as to the existence of some association between Mothercare and the book.
 
 
 
The survey by Sinclair merely confirms what the witnesses before me are all saying, that `Millennia` and `Millennium` are visually and phonetically similar and that the public might think that there is a relationship or connection between RCMS and say Millennium Orchard.
The plaintiffs have suggested to the defendants` witness that they chose not to undertake a survey themselves, using what they felt would be the correct methods as advised by Jobson, because they feared that the results might well confirm the results of the Sinclair survey. The evidence before me was that they refrained from commissioning a survey on counsel`s advice. I accept that. However, I find it hard to accept Edmond Ip`s evidence that it did not cross his mind (and others involved) that if he should commission a study the result could well be against the defendants. That possibility must have crossed the defendants` mind. Of course, at the end of the day it is for the court to decide whether there would be confusion. I am conscious that some judges had in some cases expressed the view that they did not find surveys helpful. As an example I need only quote what Dillon LJ said in 
 Mothercare UK Ltd 
 at p 117:
 
It has become rather a fashion ... for large companies involved in passing-off actions to have surveys carried out, with the results put in evidence, to show public reaction to the defendants` product, where as here, the question of misrepresentation or likelihood of deception is a question for the court. I do not for my part find such surveys helpful, just as I do not find it relevant on the question of misrepresentation that in the review of the book in the `
 Daily Telegraph
` the printer set up the title of the book as being `Mothercare Othercare`.`
 
 
 
Whether there is likelihood of confusion is a question of fact for the court to decide: see 
Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte Ltd
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 361
  ; 
[1991] SLR 133
. There is no requirement that a defendant should be carrying on a business which competes with that of the plaintiff or which would compete with any natural extension of the plaintiff`s business. However, the absence of a common field of activity is an important and highly relevant consideration in deciding whether there is a likelihood of confusion: 
Harrods Ltd v Harrodian School Ltd
 
[1996] RPC 697
 .
When we talk of confusion we cannot be referring to someone who knows the actual position - because in that event there can be no confusion. Take a typical passing-off case, where another one-star hotel is established at Serangoon Road and called itself Harbour View Hotel. There can be no confusion in the eyes of a Singaporean who knows that there is also the 3-star Harbour View Hotel at Anson Road. And if there were to be a trial in court stretching over many days concerning the use of the name `Harbour View` and which case was reported extensively in the press, more and more Singaporeans would come to know of the two separate hotels with the same name. Even so, it cannot be argued that no Singaporean will be confused. In any case not every Singaporean pays the same degree of attention to what he reads in the media. Some may not even read. Over time, some may forget or have only a vague recollection.
If I should hold, as I have, that the two words `Millennia` and `Millennium` are phonetically and visually similar, then confusion could arise among Singaporeans. There will be real likelihood of confusion. The following are some aspects of confusion that can arise. A Singaporean may think that RCMS and say Millennium Orchard are of the same chain and operated by the same management. He may thus also think that RCMS is of the same class or offers the same standard of services and facilities as Millennium Orchard. Recommendation to a friend or business associate who is looking for a 5-star establishment may well end in a recommendation to the Shangri-la or The Oriental. The image and distinctiveness of the `Millennia` name would be diluted or eroded.
When one turns to consider the position of a non-resident of Singapore who, in all probability, would not have a clear understanding of the difference between RCMS and say Millennium Orchard, it could not be any better. He could very well put RCMS out of his mind, thinking that RCMS is only a 4-star establishment. As I have mentioned before, while the reputation of R-C is gaining in the USA it has no presence in Europe (other than in Barcelona and even then known as Arts Hotel). It has only a limited presence in Asia.
There is one other point which I should allude to. M/s Fong Haque & Soh, an advertising agency, was in August 1995 appointed by R-C Co to be the advertising agency for RCMS. In cross-examination, David Fong, its managing director, who was subpoenaed by the plaintiffs to testify, told the court that his firm was in April 1995 invited by the defendants to submit a design for the names `Millennium` and `Orchard`. There are some similarities between the designs which he submitted to the defendants and those he submitted to the plaintiffs. He said when he did the designs for the plaintiffs he remembered the earlier ones he made for the defendants but he did not know what the defendants had done on the Millennium name. He said it was not unusual in the industry to change names; things were fluid. He did not tell RCMS of what he did for the defendants because `Millennium name was not at the top of my mind. We concentrated on what we needed do on the plaintiffs` brief.` He denied that he did not tell because there could be no confusion, no dilution of marketing power. As I see it, Fong`s omission to alert the plaintiffs that the defendants was in April 1995 thinking of using Millennium as their brand name could not alter the fact that the two words are similar and could cause confusion.
 Expert evidence
It is settled law that the question whether there is a real likelihood of confusion is for the court and not for any witness to decide. This is clear from the following passage of Lord Hodson in 
Parker Knoll Ltd v Knoll International Ltd
 
[1969] RPC 243
 at p 285:
 
All relevant circumstances must be taken into account, and the question whether or not there is a real likelihood of deception of the public is ultimately for the court and not for the witnesses to decide. There may of course be cases of so doubtful a nature that ... cannot properly come to a conclusion without evidence directed to the point; but there can be no doubt that in a passing-off action, the question whether the matter complained of is calculated to deceive, in other words, whether it amounts to a misrepresentation, is a matter for the judge who, looking at the documents and evidence before him, comes to his own conclusion and to use the words of Lord MacNaghten in 
Peyton v Snelling
 
[1900] 17 RPC 635
 `must not surrender his own independent judgment to any witness whatever ...
 
 
 
Lord Hodson did not rule out that in appropriate circumstances there is room for the admission of expert evidence though the court will have to ultimately decide the question. In the present case, both parties have adduced expert evidence on confusion. In 
The European Ltd v The Economist Newspaper
 
[1946] FSR 431
 some doubts seemed to have been expressed as to how far such opinion evidence is admissible. However, I would accept as correct the position as stated by Browne-Wilkinson V-C in 
Guccio Gucci SpA v Paolo Gucci
 
[1991] FSR 89
 at p 91:
 
If you ask an ordinary witness with no trade expertise what he thinks other people will do, he has no specific knowledge greater than anybody else as to what other people`s reaction will be. Those cases which are relied on by Mr Beloff are all cases where it either is not clear who the witnesses were, or it is clear that they were not expert witnesses in any ordinary sense. If on the other hand you are in an area which requires specialist knowledge, it is the function of the expert to instruct and inform the court as to those things which the court would otherwise not know, and in the process of so doing the expert is frequently asked the very question which the court has to answer. In my judgment where you have a specific area of the market of which the judge is ignorant (such as I am in this case of the designer label market) it is legitimate to produce evidence from those who are skilled in that market and know of it, and likelihood of confusion amongst customers in the same market. For those reasons I think I am entitled to look at the evidence. For myself, I do not regard it in any sense as decisive, I would have reached that conclusion without it.
 
 
 
In reviewing the expert evidence in the present case, I have followed the perimeters set by Browne-Wilkinson V-C. I have also noted the following comments of Lord Diplock in 
GE TM
 
[1973] RPC 297
 at p 322:
 
But in issues of this kind judges are entitled to give effect to their own opinions as to the likelihood of deception or confusion and, in doing so, are not confined to the evidence of witnesses called at the trial, is well established by the decisions of this House itself.
 
 
 
 
 Damage
 
I now turn to consider the third element in the tort of passing-off. On the authorities I have cited above, the plaintiffs must show that they have suffered damage or, in a 
 quia timet 
 action, are likely to suffer damage to their goodwill as a result of the defendants` misrepresentation. If it is `only a moron in a hurry (who) would be misled `as stated by Foster J in 
Morning Star Cooperative Society Ltd v Empress Newspaper
 
[1979] FSR 113
 at p 117, that is not good enough. The test is not that of a person fully familiar with the detailed operations of the plaintiffs and the defendants and could distinguish between them but that of a person who has a vague recollection or understanding of the business or product of the plaintiffs and who, on being faced with that of the defendants, may well be confused or deceived.
In the present case the plaintiffs are relying essentially on the concept of `injurious association` or `dilution of goodwill`. That there could be damage on account of such association can be seen from the judgment of Cozen-Hardy MR in 
Ewing v Buttercup Margarine Co Ltd
 
[1917] 2 Ch 1
 where he said:
 
I can see no principle for holding that a trader may not be injured ... in his business as a trader by a confusion that will lead people to conclude that the defendants are connected with the plaintiffs or a branch of the plaintiff`s business or in some way mixed up with them.
 
 
 
Both the plaintiffs and the defendants are in the same line of business, namely, in hotels. The plaintiffs emphasised that this hotel is like no other Ritz-Carlton hotel in the world. It is grander and more luxurious than the other Ritz-Carltons and the name `Millennia` serves to qualify and set it apart from the normal standards of the Ritz-Carlton. There is no dispute that the defendants` hotels in Singapore which will be named such as Millennium Orchard, etc are of a lower class than that of RCMS. Anything that dilutes the distinctiveness of `Millennia` causes damage because the plaintiffs can no longer command a premium for their product. There will be erosion of the prestige of the name. In fact, the evidence of the defendants supports what the plaintiffs are saying. The defendants` witness Edmond Ip admitted, though reluctantly, that they are extremely protective of their 4-star image and if someone were to set up a one or two-star hotel bearing the same brand name, they would try to stop that. That must be so. In fact they are so concerned of their image that if any of their own hotels does not match the 4-star standard it will not be brought under that brand name. Some of their hotels would have to be upgraded before they can be called Millennium hotels. In the words of Gremlich (NE287) `the intention was ... not to dilute the 4-star banner.` His answer to the following question is also telling:
 
 
Q: If you have a 3-star property under Millennium it would affect the customer perception of that brand? 
 
A: Yes. Every company struggles in regard to that matter.
  
 
 
Accordingly, I accept the view put forward by Arthur Kiong that `when a hotel of higher quality is associated in the public`s mind with a hotel of lower quality, the harm done would be incalculable, and certainly no amount can properly compensate for the damage done.` Gremlich has agreed that people might think there is a link between RCMS and say Millennium Orchard or the Millenia complex and the Millennium hotels. Hucksteppe in Chicago, totally unprodded, thought so too. The net result is that the public may begin to question the quality of the plaintiff`s product. It is plain common business sense.
The evidence tendered in relation to the Mandarin Hotel and the Marina Mandarin aptly illustrates the point. Some guests who stayed at the Marina Mandarin thought that Marina Mandarin was managed by or associated with the Mandarin Oriental chain and some guests checked into the Mandarin Hotel or Marina Mandarin thinking that they were staying in a Mandarin Oriental hotel. Custom could have been lost on account of such experience by a guest who stays in the Mandarin Hotel thinking that he was staying in a Mandarin Oriental hotel and thinking that all hotels having a similar sounding name provided a similar standard of service and facilities. It is clear that in this day and age, in the hotel business, the rating a hotel is perceived to have is all that matters. Every hotel or chain jealously guards its own image.
In this regard I find the following passage of Farwell J in 
British Legion v British Legion Club (Street) Ltd
 
[1931] 48 RPC 555
 highly pertinent (at p 564):
 
No one supposes that or suggests that for one moment, but that is not an answer to the plaintiff association`s claim that persons coming across the British Legion Club (Street) Ld either by seeing the name over the door of the club or by seeing it on the notepaper of the defendant company, or hearing it spoken of, will inevitably come to the conclusion, unless they are well instructed to the contrary, that the defendant company is connected in some way with the British Legion. In my judgment it is the inevitable conclusion to which any ordinary minded person would come on seeing the name of the defendants there. Such a person would think it was either a branch of the plaintiff association, or at any rate that it was a club in some way amalgamated with or under the supervision of the plaintiff association for which the plaintiff association had in some way made itself responsible. If that be the true view, then, as it seems to me, it follows that there is a real possibility of damage being done to the plaintiff association at some time or other. If the use of the defendants` name, as it is now used, is to suggest to any ordinary person that the plaintiff association is in some way connected with the defendant company or is in some way, as it were, its sponsor, then if evil befalls the defendant company and it finds itself (I am not suggesting it will) in trouble either under the licensing laws or in financial trouble or in some other way of discredit, the result will be, in my judgment, that many of the persons who knew of the existence of the defendant Club may think that the plaintiff association had been very ill-advised and very unfortunate in having any connection with such a company, and that might well tend to prevent persons who otherwise would have supported the plaintiff association by subscriptions or otherwise from continuing to do so. It is obvious that, with regard to an association such as the plaintiffs is, it is of the first importance from their point of view that they should be above any sort of suspicion of any impropriety of any sort or kind. In appealing as they do to the public, and requiring as they do vast sums to carry out their objects, it is obvious that they must have a clean sheet if they are to appeal successfully, and if the defendant company were to fall on evil days that might, although not to a great number of persons but to a certain number of persons, reflect discredit on the plaintiff association and might result in damage to that association. Under those circumstances it seems to me that when once one sees the name of the plaintiff association and the name of the defendant company and one considers the objects and purposes of the two organisations, the possibility of confusion is plain on the face of it, and the possibility and the tangible possibility of damage also, as it seems to me, is plain.
 
 
 
I should hasten to add that while in this action the plaintiffs` case is based on the fact that RCMS is a much superior product than any of the defendants` hotels in Singapore, it certainly is not the law that to succeed in an action for passing off, a plaintiff must show such a qualitative difference. If there is a real likelihood of confusion and custom would likely to be lost on account of that, passing off would also be established.
 Miscellaneous observations
I accept that the defendants have expended substantial sums worldwide in promoting their Millennium brand. But so have the plaintiffs on the name `Millennia`. Gremlich has said that the decision to adopt the Millennium name was taken in November 1994, shortly before a circular was issued giving instructions to the defendants` senior executives in various jurisdictions to take steps to register `Millennium` as a mark. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief Gremlich stated that he did not know that the plaintiffs` development was called Millenia until October 1994 and that the hotel was called RCMS until the second week of November 1994. However, in cross-examination, upon his passport being produced for examination, Gremlich admitted that in July 1994 he knew the plaintiffs` complex would be called `Millennia`. He probably also knew that the plaintiffs` hotel would be called RCMS in October 1994. In fact, he admitted having probably read the STPB Statistics for August 1994 where the name RCMS appeared. I would have found it hard to accept that the defendants (that means everybody in the defendants) had not noticed in July 1994 that the plaintiffs` development would be called Millenia and in October 1994 that the hotel would be called RCMS since both events were carried in the local media. I accept that it may not ordinarily be reasonable to expect a person to read everything that appears in the media but not if it concerns his line of business. How could Gremlich and his staff, or others in the company, not know? This is amazing. It will be recalled that as regards the name of the complex, advertisements on it appeared even before the date of the launch of the name of the complex.
It is true that in January 1994 the defendants agreed to buy a hotel in New York called Millennium Hotel. Completion of that transaction took place in June 1994. The defendants, in fact, began a search for a global brand name in December 1993. In April 1994, a consultant, JLW TransAct suggested the brand name `International`. In May 1994, a designer Chuck Painter was engaged to look for a global brand. He prepared a questionaire to gauge the corporate attitude of the senior executives of the defendants. There seems to be a period of inaction after that. In late September 1994, Painter wrote a reminder and gave a list of suggested names. It did not include `Millennium`. Then on 21 November 1994 Gremlich issued a general circular to senior executives in various countries, including Singapore, stating :
 
After many months of searching and evaluating, we have 
 strong support
 for the name `Millennium` or `Millennium Hotel`. Would you be kind enough to register the names in your own jurisdiction as soon as possible. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
There is a hiatus in the evidence as to how the defendants decided on the name `Millennium`. Gremlich said the main reason for choosing that name was because it is the name of their New York hotel. It cannot be disputed that that name must have been very much before them. But they obviously did not embrace it straight away; otherwise why go on a search? They must have doubts or reservations as to its suitability as a global brand. They engaged consultants to help them. There was no evidence how the decision was arrived at. We have the evidence of Gordon Stevenson (who was later appointed by the defendants as its Senior Vice-President for Marketing) who said that when he met with the Chairman of the defendants. on 14 October 1994 he was asked what he thought of Millennium as the brand name. The next thing we see is the instruction circular of 21 November 1994 issued by Gremlich. It should be noted that in the further and better particulars furnished by the defendants, they stated that the decision to adopt Millennium as their global brand was taken by their Chairman, in consultation with a board director and Gremlich.
The defendants` claim that by 21 November 1994 they had decided to adopt `Millennium` as the global brand is not borne out by the circular of 21 November 1994 which talked of `strong support for the name ""Millennium""` and not `it has been decided` by the Chairman or the board. It seems to me that the instruction to register was really a preemptive move, to reserve the name, leaving the option to the defendants whether they would eventually adopt it. I see that in February 1995, Stevenson produced a strategic marketing plan, which included the Millennium brand. On 22 February 1995 Stevenson wrote to the Chairman: `
 If 
 we incorporate the name Millennium as our new branding ...`. By end March 1995 invitations were extended to various advertising agencies to submit designs for the Millennium brand and Orchard brand.
Another relevant event is this. The defendants completed the purchase of the Macklowe Hotel in New York in December 1994. Under the agreement the defendants could not use the name `Macklowe` after March 1995. Their agent in New York, Mr Underhill, was anxiously searching for a name for the hotel. Gremlich saw Underhill several times in New York in December 1994. Underhill had informed him that one of his concerns was the new name for the hotel. Gremlich merely told him not to worry but never told him that the defendants had decided on the global brand Millennium. All that can only mean one thing: no decision as yet on the Millennium name, it was still under consideration. On the basis of all the documents before me I accept that by end March 1995 the defendants had decided to adopt `Millennium` as their brand name.
The point I am trying to make in the last few paragraphs is this. The defendants must have initially thought that Millennium was perhaps not entirely suitable or the best they could find as their global brand. Somehow, somewhere there was a change of mind - how and by whom we have not been told. I venture to think that it might have something to do with the way the plaintiffs have gone about promoting and presenting the name `Millennia`; it might have influenced the defendants` decision. If, as I have held, the plaintiffs have acquired goodwill in the name `Millennia` for the businesses of hotel, shopping centre and offices, the defendants are no longer at liberty to use the name `Millennium` to identify their hotels in Singapore notwithstanding that their hotel in New York is called `Millenium` which hotel could at best only have acquired goodwill in New York (or USA) but not in Singapore. There is no evidence that their New York Millennium hotel has acquired goodwill in Singapore.
I am conscious that in the years to come, as the new millennium draws nearer, there will be more and more references to the new millennium in conversation and elsewhere. That cannot affect the plaintiffs` goodwill in the name `Millennia` in hotels, offices and shopping centres. The plaintiffs are not seeking to restrain anyone from referring to the new millennium. They cannot. What they are saying is that in so far as the businesses of shopping centres, offices or hotels, are concerned, no one should use the word Millenia or Millennium to name his shopping centre, office block or hotel. I am sure the defendants are not suggesting that their Millennium Hotel in New York (or their New Zealand Millennium hotels) will lose its goodwill in the name Millennium just because in the years to come more and more people will be talking of the new millennium.
 Orders
In the result I would grant an order restraining the defendants, whether by themselves, their directors, servants or agents, and also the defendants` subsidiaries and their directors or agents from operating any hotel in Singapore under the name `Millennium` `Millenium`, `Millenia` or `Millennia` or any other similar names and from representing or advertising in Singapore or elsewhere that they operate a hotel in Singapore under any of the aforesaid names. Consequently I would also make an order that the defendants withdraw their application No 10667/94 to the RTM. In the circumstances of this case and having regard to the defendants` undertaking to the plaintiffs not to use the Millennium brand on the Singapore hotels pending the trial of this action, I do not think an inquiry as to damages is called for. The plaintiffs shall have the costs of this action.",1997-02-28 00:00:00,SG High Court

  – 
Compounding of offences
  – 
Discretion of judge to consent to composition -Whether aggravated circumstances of alleged offences makes case unsuitable for composition
  – 
s 199 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
: This was an appeal by the Public Prosecutor against a decision of the district judge consenting to the composition of an offence under s 199 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`).
 Background 
 
 
 
The respondent, Mohamed Nasir bin Mohamed, a 34-year-old male, faced three charges of outraging the modesty of the complainant, namely: 
 
First Charge
 
 
 
... that you, on 19 April 1997, at or about 9.30pm, travelling along Jalan Bahar in a motor van registration number unknown, Singapore, did use criminal force on one Siti Haizurah bte Halim, F/19 yrs, intending to outrage her modesty, to wit, by putting her right hand on your penis and masturbated for you and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Second Charge (Amended)
 
 
 
... that you, sometime in 1994, at or about 3pm, inside the toilet at Blk 212, Bukit Batok Street 21, [num ]06-233, Singapore, did use criminal force on one Siti Haizurah bte Halim, F/19 yrs, intending to outrage her modesty, to wit, did force the said Siti Haizurah bte Halim to masturbate for you and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Third Charge (Amended)
 
 
 
... that you, sometime in month of November 1994, at or about 3pm, inside the bedroom at Blk 212, Bukit Batok Street 21, [num ]06-233, Singapore, did use criminal force on one Siti Haizurah bte Halim, F/19 yrs, intending to outrage her modesty, to wit, by lying on top of her body touching her breast and continuously using your hand to touch on her private part and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
 
 
 The prosecution`s appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
The prosecution referred to 
PP v Norzian bin Bintat
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 462
  where it was observed that consent should not be granted for composition when the matter involved issues of public interest or if there were aggravating circumstances surrounding the case. The prosecution argued that the facts of the present case fell within this description and that composition should have been denied. The nature of the offence was grave and serious. The court`s attention was brought to the fact that the respondent was the victim`s uncle. Both parties shared a close relationship. The complainant had referred to the respondent as `Abah`. At the material time, the respondent was a religious teacher. The prosecution contended that, in view of the respondent`s position of influence as a role model in the Muslim community, the public interest demanded that someone in the respondent`s position should not be permitted to buy his way out of offences as serious as those charged. Instead, a thorough investigation and a full trial should be held.
The prosecution acknowledged in its submissions that the term `public interest` was a rather fluid and amorphous concept. With respect to the prosecution, I was of the view that the respondent`s profession as a religious teacher did not affect his position in law any more than if an accused were an unemployed atheist. A court of law is not an appropriate arena to test an individual`s religious righteousness. The law is only concerned with a conviction in law. I come now to the question which, in my view, this appeal turned on.
 Aggravating circumstances 
 
 
 
The prosecution submitted that the district judge failed to consider the aggravating circumstances surrounding the commission of all three offences. This was not a case in which the accused faced one charge. The three charges did not happen on the same day but over a period of three years. The first and second charges alleged extreme violations of the complainant`s modesty in that she was forced to masturbate the respondent. The third charge alleged that the respondent fondled the complainant`s private parts and breasts.
Would this conduct qualify as aggravating factors for an offence under s 354 of the Penal Code ? One has to bear in mind the overall scheme of composition permitted by the Penal Code in relation to offences of criminal force, assault and sexual offences. The prosecution referred to the recent decision of 
Kee Leong Bee & Anor v PP
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 190
  wherein this court acknowledged that there were numerous types of offences under Schedule A of the CPC which are compoundable. The following observations made in 
 Kee Leong Bee 
 bear mention here: 
 
 
20 ... Compositions are based on the public policy that where the interest of the public is not vitally affected, such as in offences which are minor and largely private in nature, the injured party should be allowed to come to a settlement with the person against whom he complains. For offences such as those under s 338 or 354 of the Penal Code which are potentially grave offences, it is difficult to conceive that Parliament would have regarded them as mere petty wrongs which do not affect the public interest and hence require no judicial sanction before composition is allowed ...
  
 
 
Compositions are not allowed for a considerable number of offences in the Penal Code. These include rape, kidnapping a woman to cause her defilement under s 366 and voluntarily causing hurt in committing the offence of outraging modesty contrary to s 354A. It is clear that offences for which composition is permissible are offences which are minor and safely dealt with by the parties involved. Turning to offences committed under s 354, the sentences imposed vary widely. They are, as submitted by the public prosecutor, primarily determined by the manner in which the offence was perpetuated. This can range from a brush of the victim`s hand to an intrusion of a victim`s sexual organs.
On the present facts, the nature of the charges faced by the respondent was unquestionably grave and serious. This was not a mere brush of the victim`s shoulder as they passed each other on a staircase landing. The three charges particularised an outrage of modesty of the severest degree. Under s 18 of the CPC, the respondent would have been liable to a sentence of 18 months` imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane, if he had been convicted of all the charges. This is on a reading of the offences as discrete offences. Upon closer examination, one cannot ignore the relationship of trust between the complainant, a very young woman and the respondent, a senior relative whom the complainant respectfully addressed as `Abah`. The alleged offences evidence an abuse of this relationship of trust over a protracted period of three years.
The district judge was minded to permit the composition on the grounds that the respondent was related to the complainant, and that he was not her religious teacher. The fact that the composition would help the parties to repair their relations may have some weight. The complainant`s generosity and courage in this matter are to her personal benefit. However, I found that the aggravated circumstances of the alleged offences alone meant that this kind of criminal conduct could not simply be disposed of by composition. Accordingly, the prosecution`s appeal was allowed and the case was remitted to the lower court for trial.

: The appellant was tried and convicted by a district judge on three charges of criminal breach of trust. The first charge read as follows: 
 
You, Gopalakrishnan Vanitha, F/42 years, NRIC NO S 1109863/J, are charged that you, between 1 May 1994 and 30 April 1995, at TRAC Chemicals Pte Ltd located at No 8 Kaki Bukit Road 2 [num ]04-03, Singapore, being a servant employed by TRAC Chemicals Pte Ltd in the capacity of a Secretary cum Office Administrator, and being entrusted in such capacity with property, to wit, funds belonging to the said TRAC Chemicals Pte Ltd, committed criminal breach of trust by dishonestly misappropriating $11,369.73 in respect of the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The second and third charges were in the same terms but were respectively in reference to a period between 1 May 1995 and 30 April 1996, with respect to a sum of $12,440; and to a period between 1 May 1996 and 30 April 1997, with respect to a sum of $30,113.29.
The appellant was sentenced to six months` imprisonment on the first and second charges and to 12 months` imprisonment on the third charge. The sentences under the first and third charges were ordered to run consecutively and concurrently with the sentence under the second charge. The appellant appealed against both her conviction and sentence. I heard her appeal on the three charges on 29 July 1999. After listening to arguments by counsel for the appellant, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The material facts of the prosecution`s case are as follows. The appellant was employed by TRAC Chemicals Pte Ltd (`the company`) from 21 March 1994 to 10 May 1997 as a confidential secretary/office administrator. The general duties and responsibilities performed by the appellant in this capacity, included, inter alia, being responsible for petty cash, minimal accounting and relevant payments, as was stated in her letter of appointment.
As for the profile of the company, it suffices to say here that it was a small company that was engaged essentially in the marketing of chemicals. The managing director of the company, one Lie Tjoan Liang, was stationed in Indonesia while the Singapore office was headed by one Edward Tracogna (`Tracogna`), the technical manager. The funds of the company were kept in an account with the United Overseas Bank and could be accessed by way of cheques signed by Tracogna.
During the course of the appellant`s employment, as Tracogna himself was fully employed in another occupation, he was able to manage the business of the company only during the weekends. It was thus Tracogna`s practice to leave much of the running of the company to the appellant, whom he and the managing director trusted fully. Tracogna would usually go to the company only on Saturdays for a debrief of the events of the week and it was during such times that Tracogna would authorise payments by cheque for salaries, CPF contributions and other expenses incurred by the company.
It was also during these Saturdays that the appellant would present Tracogna with blank cheques to sign. Tracogna would not question what the payments were for as he trusted the appellant completely in handling the financial aspects of the company and saw no reason to suspect her. Tracogna gave evidence that his intention had been for the blank cheques to be used by the appellant in situations of emergency which required payments to be made on behalf of the company during his absence.
Sometime in March or April 1997, the appellant took ill and was hospitalised. During this time, the then product manager of the company, one Eddie Chia Loy Hee (Eddie), received many demands for payments by the company`s suppliers. Eddie visited the appellant at the hospital and inquired about the cheques to the suppliers as well as the cheques for salaries. The appellant replied that she was not aware of where the cheques were. Eddie informed Tracogna of this matter and asked him about the cheques, to which Tracogna`s response was that he had already signed the cheques. Eddie subsequently spoke to the appellant again, whereupon she then said that she would come out of the hospital to check on this matter. She was however advised against leaving the hospital by Eddie who thought it better that she should remain in the hospital since she was not well.
Upon being informed of the state of affairs, Tracogna arranged for a locksmith to open the appellant`s locked office drawer, which contained the office cheque book, in Eddie`s and his presence. The drawer was found to be in a state of mess and they discovered in it a stack of unfiled documents, including correspondence, cheques, bills and invoices. Suspecting that something was amiss, Tracogna called for the company`s bookkeeper, Mr Mark Leu Yew Yue (Mark), to audit the accounts. In addition, a new auditor was appointed to conduct an audit on the funds of the company and look into the matter of possible misappropriation of funds. The audit was performed by one Siang Bee Huat (Siang) and many discrepancies were found with respect to the appellant`s salary and CPF payments as well as other allegedly unauthorised payments which the appellant had been making.
Tracogna sought to contact the appellant for an explanation but was unsuccessful in his attempts. A notice was also given to the appellant to attend an inquiry, for which she failed to turn up. Soon after, a letter was drafted and sent to the appellant terminating her services with the company and also to seek restitution for the funds allegedly misappropriated. This letter was however returned unclaimed. On the advice of his solicitors, Tracogna lodged a police report against the appellant.
At the ensuing trial below, it was submitted by the prosecution that the appellant had overpaid her own salary, made excessive employers` CPF contributions to herself and paid for her personal bills, all using the funds of the company in an unauthorised manner. The appellant was able to do this by using the pre-signed blank cheques that had been entrusted to her by Tracogna. The reason given by Tracogna for pre-signing the blank cheques was that he had trusted the appellant in the day-to-day running of the company`s business and the cheques were pre-signed for convenience since, due to his other job, Tracogna was often not in the company office and had to travel frequently.
Documentary evidence was relied on to show that the appellant was employed on a salary of $1,400 per month, which was later increased to $1,600 a month from 1 January 1995 onwards. It was submitted that the invoices, payment vouchers, bank statements, CPF records of payments as well as the IR8A tax forms that were adduced as evidence in the trial all went towards showing the misappropriation that had been committed by the appellant.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The appellant did not deny that she had received the allegedly misappropriated sums. Her defence was that the amounts she had received were all authorised and legitimate. She disputed the facts as presented by Tracogna and claimed that she had been given salary increments during the course of her employment, to be specific, from $1,400 to $1,600 in July 1994, from $1,600 to $1,900 in September 1994 and from $1,900 to $2,400 in January 1996. The appellant also sought to explain that the sums she had received appeared inflated because they included allowances for transport and overtime, which were legitimately given in addition to her gross salary. She further claimed that the use of company funds to pay off her personal bills had all been personally authorised by the managing director stationed in Indonesia.
Counsel for the appellant also argued that the three charges were fundamentally flawed as they failed to state what were the funds that were entrusted to the appellant. Counsel contended that the word `funds` used in the charges was vague and meaningless thereby rendering the charges defective.
It was further argued by counsel that the prosecution had failed to prove in law and in fact that the appellant was entrusted with property, an essential element of the offence. The defence`s case was that the appellant was never given any pre-signed blank cheques by Tracogna, and that, even if she had been given such cheques, she was at best only entrusted with signed blank cheques per se. This, it was contended, could not amount to an entrustment of property belonging to the company. In support, the local case of 
Carl Elias Moses v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 748
  was cited. In this case, it was held by Yong Pung How CJ that, for an offence of criminal breach of trust to be established, the property misappropriated must be the same property as that which was entrusted to the accused. Counsel argued that the property that was allegedly entrusted to the appellant - signed blank cheques - was different from the property that was misappropriated - funds of the company - and hence the principle stated in 
 Carl Elias Moses 
 applied here as well.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The trial judge chose to accept the evidence given by Tracogna and found him to be a truthful witness. The trial judge held that the appellant was, by virtue of her position as the office administrator, implicitly entrusted with the funds of the company and that the receipt of pre-signed blank cheques by the appellant from Tracogna, which the judge found as a fact, `merely [gave] her access and control to the funds which were already entrusted to her due to the nature of her job`. The case of 
Carl Elias Moses v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 748
  was distinguished as the trial judge took the view that the property that was entrusted here was the same as that which had been misappropriated by the appellant, ie the funds of the company. He also rejected the argument by defence counsel that the word `funds` was vague and was of the opinion that `the plain meaning of the word is money`.
The trial judge further rejected the evidence given by the appellant as he found that she had failed to substantiate her mere assertions with any evidence at all, documentary or oral. He chose instead to accept the prosecution`s case, especially the testimony of prosecution witness Siang, who had performed the audit for the company, as he observed her to be a `very helpful and impartial witness`.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
In this appeal, the arguments raised by counsel for the appellant were largely the same as those used in the court below. The grounds of appeal made in the submissions could be summarised as follows: 
(a) the three charges were defective as they failed to particularise the amount or the nature of the funds that belonged to the company; 
(b) the prosecution had failed to prove that the appellant was entrusted with property, ie funds belonging to the company, and therefore the defence of the appellant should not have been called; 
(c) the trial judge erred in rejecting the defence of the appellant; and 
(d) the sentence should be reduced as it was manifestly excessive.
 (a) Whether the three charges were defective 
 
 
 
Although this point was only very cursorily touched upon by counsel for the appellant during the course of the hearing, I shall nevertheless deal with it briefly. I note that I had cautioned in 
PP v Anuar bin Arshad
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 52
 , that: 
 
as a general rule, it cannot be satisfactory for the prosecution to prefer charges which lack clarity and specificity. The defence should be entitled to know the prosecution`s allegations with a reasonable degree of particularity, and not left to guess what these allegations will be. 
 This is especially so where the offence is one of criminal breach of trust, which can take the form of five different species of actus reus
. [Emphasis mine.]
 
 
 
Our present case dealt with a situation of criminal breach of trust but it was hardly one to which I would have said that the earlier warning applied. I did not consider the charges in question to be defective as suggested by the appellant`s counsel and did find them to have been drafted with sufficient particularity. The trial judge was correct in adopting the view that the term `funds` is neither vague nor meaningless. To my mind, it quite clearly meant money, whether in the form of actual dollar notes or cash in a bank account. It should not be necessary for a charge on the offence of criminal breach of trust to particularise in detail the exact nature of the funds nor the amount that was entrusted to the accused.
 (b) Whether the appellant was entrusted with property, ie funds belonging to the company 
 
 
 
In order for an offence of criminal breach of trust to be made out, one of the elements that must be established is that the accused was `entrusted with property` (or that the accused had `dominion over property`, but that was not the prosecution`s case here). In the authoritative Indian text 
 Ratanlal & Dhirajlal`s Law of Crimes 
 (24th Ed) Vol 2 at p 1964 it is stated that the word `entrusted` is not necessarily a term of law and it may have different implications in different contexts. In its most general significance all it imports is a handing over of possession for some purpose which may not imply the conferring of any proprietary right at all.
Counsel for the appellant argued strenuously that there was never any entrustment of property to her as she was never given any pre-signed blank cheques by Tracogna. In the alternative, it was submitted that, even if the appellant had in fact been given pre-signed blank cheques by Tracogna, she was at best only entrusted with signed blank cheques per se, which counsel contended did not in law and in fact amount to the appellant becoming entrusted with the funds of the company held in the bank.
In the court below, the trial judge had dismissed this argument by finding that the appellant had already been implicitly entrusted with the company`s funds just by virtue of the nature of her job as office administrator. This holding effectively meant that, on the question of `entrustment`, it did not matter whether any signed blank cheques were in fact given to the appellant since the entrustment was implied through the fact of the appellant`s job nature and not through the handling of the signed blank cheques which were merely, in the words of the trial judge, `access and control to the funds which was already entrusted to [the appellant] due to the nature of her job`.
With due respect to the trial judge, I was unable to agree with his interpretation of what amounted to `entrustment of property`. In 
 Gour`s The Penal Law of India 
 (10th Ed) Vol IV at p 3485, it is stated: 
 
Being entrusted with the doing of a job is not the same thing as being entrusted with any property within the meaning of Sec 405 and other cognate sections of the Indian Penal Code, even though some money or other property may come into the hand of the person in the course of his doing such job.
 
 
 
A similar statement can also be found in 
 Ratanlal & Dhirajlal`s Law of Crimes 
 (24th Ed) Vol 2 at p 1967.
In my opinion, the nature of the appellant`s job as a confidential secretary cum office administrator does entrust her with being responsible for, inter alia, petty cash and other relevant payments as well as other duties as stated in her letter of appointment. But that, surely, did not by itself amount to the appellant becoming entrusted with funds of the company. Had it not been for Tracogna`s trusting, and I must add, rather careless, practice of giving signed blank cheques, which is not a result simply by virtue of the appellant`s job nature, the appellant would not have been in the position of being entrusted with the funds of the company so as to have access and control to them and also the opportunity to embezzle them.
The issue was therefore to determine what property, if any, was in fact entrusted to the appellant. The appellant`s primary argument rested on a dispute with the trial judge`s finding of fact. The appellant`s claim was that no property was entrusted at all since she was never given any signed blank cheques. Counsel highlighted the fact that the appellant had utilised her own personal account cheques to make payments on behalf of the company and reasoned that the appellant would not have needed to do this if she indeed had been given the pre-signed blank cheques. The court`s attention was also drawn to the fact that, when the appellant`s office drawer was forced open, no blank cheques pre-signed by Tracogna were found among its contents. Tracogna could not satisfactorily explain what had happened to the blank cheques pre-signed by the company`s managing director, which he had allegedly found in the drawer, and these were also never produced in evidence by the prosecution. It was argued that all these were sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant was given blank cheques pre-signed by Tracogna.
In my opinion, the fact that the appellant had used her personal account cheques to pay for the company`s bills, while perhaps of some persuasive value, was however not conclusive. The use of the personal cheques could also very well have been a result of her having already spent the pre-signed cheques on her own personal expenses. As for the blank cheques pre-signed by the managing director, that was not essential to the prosecution`s case and the question of what had happened to these cheques was an inconsequential one. The question of whether the appellant was given pre-signed blank cheques was essentially a question of fact in which the trial judge had found in the prosecution`s favour. Tracogna`s evidence that he would sign blank cheques for the appellant to fill up was accepted by the trial judge who also found him to be a truthful witness. As the trial judge had the benefit of personally receiving the testimony of the witnesses and the opportunity to test their accuracy, veracity and credibility, his finding of fact should not be overturned unless it was a clearly erroneous conclusion. The trial judge appeared to have given careful consideration to the evidence before him and I saw no reason to interfere with this finding of fact.
The alternative submission made by counsel was that, even if signed blank cheques had been given to the appellant, all that she was entrusted with were only signed blank cheques per se. It was argued that, at the time the signed blank cheques were given to her, there were no amounts stated on the cheques and hence no property of the company was represented in those cheques when she was entrusted with them. In raising this argument, counsel was suggesting that the property represented in a signed blank cheque was the mere paper value of the cheque since no amount was stated on it.
I found absolutely no substance in such an argument which cannot be supported by reason or logic. The property in a signed blank cheque is the entire value of the funds to which the cheque is capable of having access to. A cheque is an instrument upon which money can be procured and hence the property and value in a validly completed cheque is that of the amount stated to be paid to the payee. With regard to a signed blank cheque, a person given the authority to fill in the name of the payee and the amount payable would be entrusted with not just the correct amount to be actually paid, but rather with all the funds to which the cheque is capable of accessing, since the person would be at liberty, albeit possibly without authority, to fill in that maximum amount which the cheque can access.
The point would be clearly illustrated by the following example. In the first situation, the accused is entrusted with a signed cheque in which the amount has been filled in as $5,000, and therefore by the reasoning employed by the appellant, there is property represented in such a cheque. There is however no payee stated on the cheque and the accused is instructed to fill in the name of the intended payee, which he fails to do, but instead misappropriates the amount for himself by filling in his own name instead. In a second situation, the accused is merely given a signed blank cheque and is told to fill in the correct payee and amount payable and he too similarly misappropriates it. If the appellant`s submission is accepted, it would mean that an offence of criminal breach of trust would appear to be made out in the first situation but not in the second, simply because in the second scenario no amount was stated on the signed cheque when it was handed to the accused and therefore no property was entrusted. This clearly is an illogical distinction leading to absurd results. I found it highly difficult to see why an accused in the second situation, which is not unlike that of the present facts before us, should escape the punishment imposed by law, especially when he would have had the liberty to inflate the amount to be filled into the blank cheque and embezzle an even larger amount than the originally intended sum.
Perhaps to emphasise the point further, I would draw another example. Consider the factual scenario having been instead that the funds were kept as cash in a safe within the company premises and the key to the safe was entrusted to the appellant. It should be immediately apparent that the appellant was entrusted with, not just a mere piece of metal, but with all the funds of the company that were kept within that safe. So quite plainly, property was in fact entrusted to the appellant when she was given the signed blank cheques by Tracogna and this property was the funds belonging to the company, TRAC Chemicals Pte Ltd, kept in its bank account with the United Overseas Bank. The case of Carl Elias Moses v PP did not apply to the present situation, which could be distinguished on the facts since the property - the funds belonging to the company - which was entrusted to the appellant, was the same property which she was being charged with misappropriating.
 (c) Whether the trial judge erred in rejecting the defence of the appellant 
 
 
 
Turning now to the next ground of appeal, it was contended that the trial judge erred in rejecting the appellant`s defence. In support, the appellant sought to rely on the oral evidence she gave during the trial as well as the defence exhibits D2, D3 and D4 that were adduced and admitted as evidence.
Having examined the evidence adduced by the appellant as well as the prosecution, I found there were many glaring discrepancies in the appellant`s allegations and even self-contradictions in her own claims. In this respect, I was in agreement with the trial judge`s observation that these inconsistencies were most illuminatingly highlighted by the testimony of Siang Bee Huat (Siang). The evidence given by Siang was largely unchallenged by the appellant and, through this evidence, it could be seen that, even if the court had initially been prepared to accept the appellant`s claim of salary increases, the audit and calculations done by Siang would show that this claim could not be properly reconciled with the undisputed documentary evidence reflected in the payment vouchers, the bank statements, the CPF records of payments and even the IR8A tax forms relied on by the appellant.
The appellant had sought to cover up these inconsistencies with vague excuses of `transport and overtime` allowances and unsubstantiated assertions that the unauthorised payments were in fact sanctioned by the company`s managing director. Given the facts that the company had such a small presence in Singapore and the appellant was hired on a salary of only $1,400, I found it hardly believable that the company would have allowed her to make claims for transport and overtime allowances amounting to $6,000 over a short period of six months. The same applied to the personal expenses, which came up to at least $3264.45, that she paid for by using the company`s funds.
It was alleged by the appellant that her salary increments and the use of company funds to settle her personal bills had all been approved by the managing director. If her bare assertions were indeed true, then the managing director`s testimony would most certainly have been important in corroborating her otherwise unsubstantiated claims. Yet the appellant did not appear concerned to seek such help from the managing director and, as noted by the trial judge, no reasons were offered for this lapse. The appellant`s apparent failure, or even lack of attempt, to get the managing director to give evidence on her behalf invited much suspicion and I was inclined in these circumstances to infer that the appellant`s claims were in fact false and would have been exposed if the managing director had been called to give evidence.
 (d) Whether the sentence was manifestly excessive 
 
 
 
The maximum custodial sentence possible under s 408 of the Penal Code is seven years. The trial judge rightly noted that the sentence imposed for these types of offences depended on the value of the sums misappropriated and that for the amounts involved such as in the present case, the sentence ranged from 9 to 15 months` imprisonment. Strictly speaking, the sentence that could have been imposed upon the appellant would be a term of 15 months for each convicted charge and this, by virtue of s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), would amount to a total of 30 months` imprisonment. By comparison, the current sentence of a total of 18 months` imprisonment appeared to be inadequate. Furthermore, the appellant had not sought to mitigate at all, whether by pleading guilty or making restitution. I was not convinced at all by counsel`s submission that the conviction and sentence of the appellant would lead to hardship for her teenaged daughter and husband, who is currently unemployed. The family always suffers and this is part and parcel of the criminal game. In light of the amounts that had been misappropriated, I affirmed that the term of 18 months` imprisonment imposed altogether for the three convictions was not manifestly excessive and should remain.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the reasons given above, I was of the opinion that there were no merits in this appeal. The appeal was dismissed and the sentence imposed by the trial judge was affirmed.

: In the court below, the appellant was charged under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) for cheating as follows: 
 
You, Lee Foo Choong Kelvin (M/46 Years) NRIC No S0163359G are charged that you, between March and October 1996, in Singapore, cheated one Cheong Khoon Yoong Philip (`Philip`) when you deceived the said Philip:
 
 
 
 
- by your dishonest concealment of a Basic Checklist of Required Exhibits containing onerous conditions which purportedly had to be fulfilled to secure the release of funds by or arranged by a purported American Funder for the development of three projects, thus causing Philip to believe that he only had to pay commitment fees amounting to a total of US$300,000 to secure funding for the development of the said projects; and 
 
- by representing to Philip that sums amounting to a total of US$300,000 had to be paid through you in order to secure the release of funds by or arranged by a purported American Funder for the development of three projects and that the said sums comprising US$100,000 for each project or any part thereof would be refunded to Philip regardless of the outcome of the loan applications, when you had no intention of refunding or arranging for the refund of the said sums of US$100,000 for each project or any part thereof,
  
 
 
and by your deception through one or both of the above means, you dishonestly induced the said Philip to deliver a total sum of US$300,000 to you which Philip would not have done so had he not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Section 420 of the Penal Code states that: 
 
Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person ..., shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
 
 
 
Cheating is defined in s 415 of the Penal Code as follows: 
 
Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, ... is said to `cheat`.
 
 
 
 
 Explanation 1
 - A dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section.
 
 
 
As for the question of dishonesty, s 24 of the Penal Code provides that: 
 
Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.
 
 
 
After the trial, the appellant was convicted of the offence and was sentenced to 24 months` imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay the prosecution`s costs of $20,000, in default of which payment he would have to serve another two months` imprisonment. He appealed against the conviction.
After hearing arguments from both parties, I dismissed the appeal. I further enhanced the sentence to 36 months` imprisonment. I now give my reasons.
 Facts 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Background facts
 
I begin by setting out the background facts to the case, which were not in dispute.
The appellant is a Singaporean businessman, who since adulthood has dabbled in a number of different businesses, including construction and jewellery. For the past ten years, he has described himself as an `international finance co-ordinator`, proffering a number of business cards to that effect. The history of this began in 1985, when he moved to the USA to `co-ordinate business`, trying, he said, `to bring people together from East and West to make business venture` [sic]. He returned to Singapore in or about 1992.
While he was in the USA, he met an American businessman named Carl Lane (`Carl`), who represented a US finance company based in Atlanta, Georgia called Global Commerce Company NA (`GCC`). GCC apparently had some money to invest in the Far East and the appellant was subsequently appointed as a `Finance Broker` for them. His task as a broker was to persuade businessmen in need of finance to make `loan applications` to GCC. If the loan applications were successful, he would receive a commission of 1% of the amount actually funded by GCC.
On 30 September 1995, after the appellant had returned to Singapore, Carl sent him a document entitled `Summary of Global Commerce Co`s Loan Program and Procedures`. This document set out in summary the process of obtaining a `loan` from GCC. Two special features of the loan procedure were of relevance to this case. First, at the stage of applying for a loan, the applicant would have to provide a `commitment fee` of US$65,000, together with US$15,000 for GCC`s expenses (US$80,000 in total). The US$65,000 would be refunded when the loan application was approved, which was to be within 150 days of the loan application date. If the loan application was not approved, the commitment fee would also be returned, but only if the non-approval of the loan was for a reason `other than the wrongful actions of the applicant`.
The second important feature of the loan application process related to a further document appended to the summary of GCC`s loan procedure called the `Basic Checklist of Required Exhibits`. This was essentially a list of documents required from the loan applicant running to some one and a half pages long, some of the documents being very onerous and expensive to obtain. For example, one of the required items was: `Complete plans and specifications signed by the architect and engineer, including: Plot plan, property location map, survey, Architect`s rendering and summary of other pertinent data`. The appellant said in evidence that when he received the loan application summary document from Carl, he `merely perused it very briefly` and did not notice the Basic Checklist.
Some time in 1995, the appellant met one Mark Yu (`Mark`), a Singaporean businessman who represented a Chinese property development consortium called `Paciworld`. They became friends. In 1996, Paciworld wanted to develop three property projects in China, namely, the `Seaview Hotel Project` in Haikou, the `Golden City Project` in Shanghai, and the `Stone Sparrow Golf Resort` in Qingdao. Mark was looking for financing for these projects in Singapore. The appellant suggested to Mark that he should use the appellant`s financiers - GCC. He explained the loan application procedure to Mark, who was very interested. However, Paciworld did not want to pay the commitment fee or the expenses for the loan application. Together, Mark and the appellant started looking for someone to front the commitment fee and expenses. Mark subsequently introduced the complainant, Philip Cheong (`Philip`), to the appellant. Philip, an electrical contractor by trade, was interested in investing some money in property projects.
 The appellant`s conduct which formed the basis of the charge
The appellant`s conduct towards Philip formed the basis of the charge against him. At the trial, the prosecution submitted that the facts typified a classic example of `advance fee fraud`. In essence, the prosecution`s case was that, through a series of meetings and communications between the parties, the appellant dishonestly persuaded Philip to pay to him personally the equivalent of US$300,000 in `commitment fees` for three GCC loan applications. These payments were made in three separate instalments. First, on 1 July 1996, Philip gave the appellant a cheque for S$140,000 (the equivalent of US$100,000), which was meant for the Paciworld Haikou Seaview Hotel project. After this payment was made, the appellant exerted pressure on Philip to pay commitment fees in relation to the other two Paciworld projects. Philip eventually capitulated and on 19 September 1996 gave the appellant a Standard Chartered Bank bank draft for US$70,000. In addition, on 28 October 1996, he gave the appellant a further cheque for S$181,000 being the balance of the US$300,000 in commitment fees due in respect of the three projects.
The prosecution alleged that, in the course of their numerous dealings, the appellant made several material misrepresentations to Philip in relation to the legal status of the commitment fees. In particular, he told Philip that the commitment fees were fully refundable, whether or not the loan applications were successful, without any exceptions. The appellant made these statements knowing that they were untrue and that Philip would rely on them. Having succeeded in persuading Philip to pay him the commitment fees, the appellant deposited the money into his own bank account, where it was set-off against his substantial overdraft. He never remitted any money to GCC.
Next, the appellant induced Philip to sign certain legal documents, including three GCC `loan applications`, thus making Philip feel that he was now responsible for obtaining the funding required for the three Paciworld projects. It was only after these documents had been signed that the appellant told Philip that in fact only 65% of the commitment fees were refundable if the loan applications failed, and then only if the failure was not due to the fault of the applicant (which, for all intents and purposes, was now Philip himself).
Finally, at the eleventh hour, the appellant presented Philip with the `Basic Checklist` of required documents. He now told Philip that this had to be complied with as a matter of urgency, failing which GCC would refuse the loan application and keep the commitment fees. He did this knowing full well that many of the documents listed in the Basic Checklist would be time-consuming and expensive to obtain, and therefore that Philip would not be able to comply with the checklist within the required time frame. The appellant`s sole intention in producing the Basic Checklist was to defeat the loan applications and lay the blame on Philip himself, so that he could keep all of Philip`s money.
This version of the events was accepted by the trial judge, and I set out below her findings which were pertinent to the issues raised in the appeal.
 The trial judge`s findings 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Misrepresentations made by the appellant to induce payment
 
The trial judge found that the appellant made the following material misrepresentations to Philip in order to induce him to pay the US$300,000: 
 Misrepresentation [num ]1: that the cheques and bank draft for the commitment fees should be made out in his (the appellant`s) name. 
 Philip had paid the commitment fees in the form of cheques and bank drafts in the appellant`s name. The trial judge found that according to GCC`s own loan application procedures as documented, the payments should have been made directly to the GCC. 
 Misrepresentation [num ]2: that the total US$100,000 per project was refundable regardless of whether the loan applications were successful, and in relation to the first US$100,000 paid on 1 July 1996, that this would be refunded by the end of November. 
 The trial judge found that the appellant did not explain clearly (or at all) that only US$65,000 of the US$100,000 was refundable, neither did he explain the conditions of refundability. In particular, there was a condition that the commitment fees would only be refunded if the application was unsuccessful for reasons `other than the applicant`s fault`. Although the defence did produce documents signed by Philip which stated this fact, the judge accepted Philip`s evidence that the documents were technical legal documents which he could not have been expected to understand, and that the documents had not been explained to him when he signed them. In any event, Philip signed these documents only after a substantial part of the commitment fees had been paid. 
 Misrepresentation [num ]3: that the three Paciworld projects for which loans were sought were connected and could not proceed independently. 
 Philip had been interested in funding only one Paciworld project, but after Philip paid the appellant the initial S$140,000, the appellant told Philip that if he did not pay a further US$200,000 for the other Paciworld projects, his initial S$140,000 would be in jeopardy. The judge found that in fact there was no reason why each Paciworld project could not proceed independently. This was simply a dishonest tactic on the appellant`s part to exert pressure on Philip to pay him more money. 
 Misrepresentation [num ]4: that Philip would have to fly with the appellant to the USA to sign the loan application documents, and that the full sum of US$300,000 had to be paid before they left for the USA. 
 In late September 1996, the appellant took Philip on a trip to Atlanta, Georgia, where Philip had a meeting with Carl and signed three legal documents with GCC, each entitled `Loan Application`. The appellant had told Philip that the trip to the USA was a necessary part of the loan application procedure, but the judge found that in fact GCC were prepared to send the documents over to Singapore to be signed. The appellant simply told Philip that they had to go to the USA together to sign the documents as a means of putting pressure on him to pay as quickly as possible.
 Dishonest concealment of Basic Checklist of Required Exhibits
In relation to the Basic Checklist, the trial judge made the following findings. 
(a) The appellant clearly knew as early as 1995 that there was a list of things to do called the `Basic Checklist of Required Exhibits`. 
(b) The appellant did not tell Philip about the Basic Checklist, and in fact never intended to tell Philip about the Checklist at all, or at any rate until the commitment fees had been paid. This was failure to disclose a `material fact`. 
(c) The appellant`s reasons for not revealing the existence of the Basic Checklist earlier, which were (i) that he was unsure whether the checklist applied to this particular application, and (ii) that he thought `it would not be a problem` for Paciworld to comply with the checklist, were `unreasonable and ridiculous`. 
(d) The conditions set out in the Basic Checklist were onerous in terms of time, effort and costs.
 Dishonest intention
The trial judge found that the appellant never intended to secure the funding for the projects, neither did he intend to arrange for the refund of the commitment fees or any part thereof. He did not remit any substantial part of Philip`s money to GCC, but kept it for his own benefit instead. He was also dishonest in that he never intended Philip to be able to comply with the Basic Checklist.
Based on the above findings, the trial judge found that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that 
(a) the appellant had induced Philip 
(b) to pay over to him US$300,000 in the form of `commitment fees` 
(c) by dishonestly misrepresenting, inter alia, that the full amount of the fees would be refunded by the end of November 1996, and 
(d) by dishonestly concealing the `Basic Checklist of Required Exhibits`, 
(e) which moneys he had never intended to return to Philip and to date had not returned, but had instead used for his own benefit.
All the necessary elements of the offence of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code having been proven, the trial judge convicted the appellant of the offence charged.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
On appeal, the appellant challenged several findings of fact made by the judge on material points.
 Refundability of the commitment fees
The appellant denied that he had made any misrepresentations in relation to the conditions of refundability of the commitment fees. He asserted that he had told Philip that only US$65,000 was refundable if the application failed, and further that this was only if the application failed through no fault of the applicant. He drew the court`s attention to two documents which set out these facts, both of which had been signed by Philip. The first document was entitled `Agreement for GCC (HK) (NA) Loan`. This stated that the commitment fee per project was US$65,000, the remaining US$35,000 being GCC`s and the appellant`s expenses. The second document was the loan agreement which Philip had signed in Atlanta. This stated that the US$65,000 would be refunded only if the application failed through no fault of the applicant.
The appellant also pointed out that the evidence of other prosecution witnesses, in particular Mark, clearly showed that they were all aware that only 60% to 70% of the commitment fees was refundable.
Considering the evidence, I had no doubt that the trial judge was perfectly entitled to find that the appellant had made material misrepresentations as to the conditions of refundability of the commitment fees. It was clear from the outset that Philip had little experience in financial matters and relied heavily on the appellant for information regarding his legal rights. One cannot but help ask why, if the appellant`s version of events was true, Philip would risk such a large sum of money on a scheme which was so highly speculative. Having considered the totality of the appellant`s behaviour from first to last, I agreed with the trial judge that he must have been less than forthcoming as to the true nature of the payments made by Philip.
Further, I did not think too much reliance could be placed on the fact that Philip had executed certain legal documents which set out the conditions of refundability. These documents were filled with legal jargon, which would be barely comprehensible to a layman. On the question of Philip`s knowledge of the English language, the trial judge found that it had not been established that Philip had sufficient knowledge of English to enable him to understand the technical and legal jargon in the documents which he signed. That being the case, he would clearly have relied on what the appellant told him in relation to the documents. Further, I noted that the trial judge found that, in any event, the appellant could not have adequately explained to Philip what constituted `wrongful action` by the applicant which would be sufficient to prevent the refund of the US$65,000, as he admitted in court that Carl had never explained this to him in the first place.
The trial judge further stated in her judgment that the evidence of Philip was credible, straightforward and consistent. She believed the testimony of prosecution witness Cheng Wai Meng, who had been involved in the Paciworld projects, that Philip was `a simple person, easy to get along with and had ""no airs""`. On the other hand, she said of the appellant that he was often evasive and failed to answer the prosecution`s questions directly, proceeding mostly with what he wanted to talk about as part of his defence. In her view, the evidence before the court, including the evidence given by the appellant himself, showed the appellant to be a self-serving person. Having considered the evidence, I agreed.
 Dishonest concealment of the Basic Checklist
In relation to the Basic Checklist of documents, the appellant asserted that, from the start, he had told Philip that there were things to be done for the loan application, although he had not specifically provided Philip with the Basic Checklist. He argued that, when he received earlier copies of the Basic Checklist, he had not read them and had merely filed them away, or alternatively, that at the time he thought that the checklist did not apply to the three projects in question. Furthermore, the appellant reiterated his position that it `it would not be a problem` for Philip to comply with the Basic Checklist.
I found these arguments to be of little merit. At the trial, it had emerged that the appellant had in 1995 (a year before the Paciworld projects) been involved with another project in China called the `Sanbao project`, which concerned the building of the `Shanghai Baocheng International Cultural Art Centre`. The appellant had introduced one Kuok Tak Tin to GCC for the purposes of obtaining a loan, and Kuok had then paid the necessary commitment fees. The proposed GCC loan application subsequently fell through for precisely the same reason as in the Paciworld projects, ie the Basic Checklist was sent to the loan applicant only after the commitment fees had been paid, and by that time it was too late for the applicant to comply with the Basic Checklist within the time frame specified by GCC. It seemed to me incredible that the appellant should assert that, even after the prior project, he was unaware of the importance of the Basic Checklist, and in particular the need to disclose it as soon as possible. In my view, had the appellant been genuine in attempting to secure the loans, he would have disclosed the Basic Checklist as soon as possible, rather than produce it after the commitment fees had been paid.
In any event, it was not in dispute that the appellant had received a copy of the Basic Checklist in September 1995. If the appellant was as experienced in finance matters as he claimed, it surely could not have escaped his notice that several of the documents set out in the Basic Checklist were fairly onerous and expensive to obtain. That being the case, his failure to produce the Basic Checklist could only be interpreted as a deliberate concealment.
 Location of Philip`s money
The appellant argued that he had not forwarded Philip`s money to GCC because he had made an arrangement with GCC to retain the moneys on a `contra` arrangement, ie he retained Philip`s money in lieu of other moneys that were owing to him from GCC in relation to a separate transaction. I found his reason for not forwarding Philip`s money to GCC unbelievable, and, in any event, it was not supported by any documentary evidence.
On why he had not to date returned Philip`s money to him up to the date of trial, he stated in evidence: 
 
It is not as if I cannot possibly raise the money to pay Philip the US$300,000. My father is prepared to sell his house in Jalan Lim Tai See to raise the funds if necessary. However, I have steadfastly refused to pay Philip simply because I refused to bow to the pressure he has now deliberately exerted on me by filing this false charge against me at CAD.
 
 
 
I found this assertion unconvincing and brazen. If anything, it showed how he was prepared to distort the facts to exonerate his own behaviour.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
At the hearing before this court, counsel for the appellant summarised his position as follows: 
 
The appellant is a genuine businessman in the business of co-ordinating finance. He has undertaken the application for financing of the Paciworld projects in good faith. The applications were all properly documented. Payment of a commitment fee of US$100,000 was required for each project for expenses in arranging the loans and to serve as a deposit for the funder.
 
 
 
It was made clear to Mark and Philip that US$20,000 of the commitment fee was payable to the appellant for his expenses. US$15,000 was payable to GCC NA for their expenses. These are non-refundable. The balance of US$65,000 was payable to GCC as collateral commitment fee. This is refundable in the event that the loan is not successful and if the failure is not due to the wrongful action of the applicant. If the loan is successful, it is possible to have a full refund of the commitment fee as the US$35,000 non-refundable fee can be reimbursed to the payor of the commitment fee as pre-operation expenses.
 
 
 
Knowing full well of the terms and the risk, Philip agreed to come up with the commitment fee for the three projects as the potential return was good as he can become a 20% shareholder of the two companies which were incorporated to apply for the loans.
 
 
 
However, ... Philip and Mark fell out over the Hainan trip ... This caused the appellant to have a lot of difficulties in getting Paciworld and Mark to supply the documents in order to comply with the checklist.
 
 
 
Further, when Philip jumped to the conclusion that he had been cheated by the appellant and reported the matter to the CAD, this compounded the situation as nobody then wanted to be involved in the project or the preparation of the checklist any further, resulting in the failure of the loan application.
 
 
 
The appellant may have breached his responsibility or duty as a finance co-ordinator but he is certainly not a cheat. This is a case of an investment venture that has gone wrong because of a combination of factors, but the criminal offence of cheating by the appellant was definitely not one of them. If at all, the recourse open to Philip lies in the civil court.
 
 
 
After hearing arguments from both parties and considering all the evidence, I did not believe that the appellant`s position was at all credible. In my view, the appellant showed himself to be an opportunist and a rogue, and clearly one of some ingenuity.
Once the appellant had induced Philip to pay the first commitment fee, he used this payment as leverage to pressure Philip to pay more money, and he also used the fictitious requirement of the trip to the USA as a means of putting pressure on Philip to pay more quickly. I did not believe that the appellant ever intended that the loan applications should be successful, or at least, he was indifferent to their success. He might originally have intended to retain only 20% or some other proportion of the commitment fees and to return the rest, but to my mind that was of little relevance as in the end he kept all of it. The fact that a substantial part of the money went towards reducing his own overdraft was further evidence of his dishonest intent. His use of the Basic Checklist to scuttle the whole process and push the blame on Mark and Philip himself was, to my mind, calculated and dishonest.
The trial judge`s findings were findings of primary fact, which an appellate court would not disturb unless it was clearly reached against the weight of the evidence (see 
 Lim Ah Poh v PP 
 [ 1992] 1 SLR 713). I found nothing to suggest that the trial judge`s findings of fact or conclusions were incorrect in the slightest, and therefore dismissed the appeal.
I further ordered, pursuant to the High Court`s powers on appeal under s 256(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), that the appellant`s sentence be enhanced from 24 months` imprisonment to 36 months` imprisonment. The sentence imposed by the district judge was, in my view, manifestly inadequate in view of the amount of money involved (approximately S$500,000), and the attitude of the appellant after the matter had been reported to the Commercial Affairs Department. In respect of the latter, I should point out that at no time did the appellant accept responsibility for his actions, and he maintained the correctness of his position in a defiant manner right to the end, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Had he returned the money to Philip when the deal had initially gone sour, which he professed he had the ability to do, he would not be in the position he is now in.

: The respondent pleaded guilty to a charge under s 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant. The punishment prescribed under s 332 is imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any two of these punishments. The respondent was convicted and sentenced by district judge Louis D`Souza to nine months` imprisonment.
The Public Prosecutor appealed against the sentence and argued for it to be enhanced. I allowed the appeal and enhanced the sentence to 20 years of preventive detention. I now give my reasons.
 The brief facts 
 
 
 
The facts of the offence were not disputed by the respondent during the trial. On 28 February 1999, at about 3.40am, the police received a message from one Lew Leng Meng Raymond (`the informant`) who said `Earlier a man from the next table accused me of staring at him. Thus I had to leave the table but my brother is still there. I am waiting for police.` Police constable Jayasaravanan s/o Jayapragasam (`the victim`) and his colleague were then despatched by the Geylang Police Divisional Headquarters to the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, the victim and his colleague contacted the informant who pointed out the respondent to them. They approached the respondent to check his particulars but the respondent was uncooperative. The respondent, who smelt strongly of alcohol, shouted while the victim checked his identity card and then used his index finger to push the victim`s colleague. When the victim warned the respondent to behave himself, the respondent became aggressive and picked up a red plastic chair from nearby and swung it directly at the victim. The chair hit the victim on the left side of his body, causing him to sustain injuries of the following nature: (i) a 2 cm area of superficial mild abrasion over the right shin; (ii) tenderness of the left hand medially; and (iii) tenderness over the left wrist distal radius. The respondent was then placed under arrest and brought back to the Geylang Police Station.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The respondent, who was represented by counsel at the trial below, admitted to the offence and pleaded guilty to it. In mitigation, it was pleaded, inter alia, that the injury caused to the victim was minor and that the offence had arisen out of the respondent`s heavy drinking. It was also mentioned that the respondent`s wife was a diabetic who was seeking medical treatment. In view of the respondent`s numerous antecedents, which were admitted, the DPP urged the court to pass a deterrent sentence, in particular, the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention.
In sentencing the respondent, the district judge noted that the normal tariff for the offence is three months` imprisonment. He sentenced the respondent to three times this normal tariff on account of his antecedents. He rejected the DPP`s request to impose preventive detention as he found it, notwithstanding the respondent`s antecedents, an inappropriate sentence. He was of the opinion that the respondent had pleaded guilty and was clearly remorseful. Furthermore, the injury caused to the victim was mild and the respondent had been drinking heavily at the time of the offence. Most significantly, the district judge highlighted the fact that the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence in question is only five years whereas the minimum term for preventive detention is seven years, adding that `the laws of this land must be enforced with some sanity and proportionality to the offence`.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The Public Prosecutor appealed against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate and contended that the district judge had erred in failing to adequately consider the respondent`s previous convictions for violent offences. The antecedents of the respondent, which were set out by the DPP, ran into a long list, thoroughly reflecting the respondent`s appalling propensity for crime and violence.
Another ground of appeal submitted by the DPP was that the district judge had erred in law and principle by drawing a comparison between the maximum term of imprisonment for the present offence with the minimum term of preventive detention. I was in whole-hearted agreement with the DPP`s submission and was of the opinion that this was, regrettably, an example of a district judge misreading the law and objective of preventive detention.
Section 12(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), which empowers a court to order the preventive detention of a person, reads as follows: 
 
Where a person who is not less than 30 years of age -
 
 
 
 
(a) is convicted before the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of 2 years or upwards, and has been convicted on at least 3 previous occasions since he attained the age of 16 years of offences punishable with such a sentence, and was on at least two of those occasions sentenced to imprisonment or corrective training; or 
 
(b) is convicted at one trial before the High Court or a District Court of 3 or more distinct offences punishable with imprisonment for a term of 2 years or upwards, and has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one month since he attained the age of 16 years of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of 2 years or upwards,
  
 
 
then, if the Court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that he should be detained in custody for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiration of his sentence, the Court, unless it has special reasons for not so doing, shall pass, 
 in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment, a sentence of preventive detention of such term of not less than 7 nor more than 20 years
 as the Court may determine. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
As I stated in 
Yusoff bin Hassan & Ors v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1032
 , the purpose of imposing preventive detention is in order to protect the public. If the offender in question proved by his history of criminal behaviour to be a menace to the society, he should and must be put away for the protection and safety of the community at large.
Bearing in mind the objective and rationale behind the imposition of preventive detention, it should be clear that this sentence is meant essentially for habitual offenders, who must be over the age of 30 years, whom the court considers to be beyond redemption and too recalcitrant for reformation. The minimum term stipulated in s 12(2) of `not less than 7 years` indicates that the normal limitations on sentencing do not apply when the court is considering a sentence of preventive detention. It would be a mistake to confuse a sentence of preventive detention with a term of imprisonment as the two are obviously distinct sentences. The wording of s 12(2) cannot be more unambiguous when it states that preventive detention is to be imposed `in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment`. In 
 Yusoff bin Hassan v PP 
 (supra) at p 1034, I had stated the law in this area in very clear terms when I said: 
 
... in ordinary cases, the district court only has the jurisdiction to sentence an offender to up to seven years` imprisonment on any one charge - s 11(3)(a) [Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)]. Where the offender`s previous convictions or antecedents justify it, a sentence of up to ten years` imprisonment may be imposed - proviso to s 11(3). In addition, the term of imprisonment which may be imposed is subject to the limits prescribed by the statute which creates the offence. 
 In imposing a sentence of corrective training or preventive detention, the judge is only subject to the limits in s 12 of the CPC
 [Emphasis added.] Thus, for a single offence punishable with imprisonment of a term of up to two years, the offender might well be sentenced to corrective training or preventive detention (for at least five and seven years respectively). If he had been sentenced to imprisonment instead, it would obviously have been for no more than two years.
 
 
 
Furthermore, corrective training and preventive detention are meant to supplant a sentence of imprisonment which would otherwise be ordered. These sentences are passed `in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment`. It would appear that the sentencing court should simply address its mind to the appropriate period of custody merited by the offences for which the offender has been convicted before it, and his criminal record.
 
 
 
In the present case, the respondent, despite his relative youth of only 35 years, had already accumulated a large number of criminal convictions behind him. He had been charged and convicted 16 times since 1980, sentenced to a total of 15 years of imprisonment for crimes involving violence and had received altogether 25 strokes of the cane. Yet all these had proven to be of little deterrent effect on the respondent, who committed this latest offence barely two months after he was last released from prison for his last conviction for vandalism and for voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon. The respondent had started his life in crime mildly when he committed an offence of outrage of modesty at the tender age of 17 years. He then progressed to use offensive weapons, commit rape, criminal intimidation, theft, causing grievous hurt, then more criminal intimidation, theft, armed robbery, more causing hurt, doing an act which endangers life or the personal safety of others, vandalism and other offences involving violence.
The respondent, who was not represented in the appeal, pleaded for leniency and claimed that he had turned over a new leaf. With a criminal history such as the respondent`s, which I found impossible to overlook, and the very fact that he had shown little or no change for the better even after 16 previous convictions, one would have had to be extremely naÃ¯ve to take the respondent`s words for the truth. From the way the facts appeared, the sentence of nine months` imprisonment passed by the district judge, had it been affirmed by me and meted out, would have been but a mere holiday for the respondent.
The DPP had urged the court to impose a sentence of either preventive detention or corrective training. Corrective training is another form of custody similarly directed towards habitual offenders and is also expressed to be for a substantial period of time, more specifically, for a period of five to 14 years. However, corrective training is only appropriate and suitable where the offender shows that he is capable of reform and can be corrected, so to speak, and prevented from committing further crime. This was plainly not the case with the respondent. His affinity to crime and aggression came close to an addiction and it would only be expedient for the protection of the public to take him out of circulation for the maximum possible period. A sentence of preventive detention in a case such as the present could not have been more appropriate.
 Pre-sentence report 
 
 
 
In imposing this sentence, I took note that s 12(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that before the court passes a sentence of preventive detention, it shall consider the physical and mental condition of the offender and his suitability for such a sentence. In 
Kua Hoon Chua v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
 , I had pointed out that pre-sentencing reports, such as preventive detention reports, are called for by judges essentially only as a matter of practice. There is nothing in the Criminal Procedure Code which makes it mandatory for the court to call for such a pre-sentencing report before passing sentence. In the present case, having studied the respondent`s records carefully and observed his appearance in court, I was fully satisfied that the respondent was both physically and mentally suited for a sentence of preventive detention. Seeing that there was no need to prolong the process any further by waiting for a preventive detention report, I dispensed with the usual procedure of calling for such a report.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In light of the foregoing reasons, the appeal was accordingly allowed. Having taken into consideration the nature and extent of the respondent`s previous offences and convictions and the apparent lack of repentance on his part, I imposed the maximum term of 20 years of preventive detention on the respondent.

I have read the statement of facts adduced in the court below and I think it speaks for itself. Here is a man who - apparently imagining some insult or injury done to his son by a little brown dog - took it into his head to seek his revenge on the animal. He had, so it would seem, the cunning to wait till the early hours of the morning, when the dog was chained up and defenceless, and its owner nowhere about. He had strength enough to beat the dog with a metal stand and leave it with serious injuries. And if his record of previous convictions is anything to go by, he must also be a man of consistent beliefs - in this case, namely, the belief that violence solves most ills and `might is right`.
I have considered the case carefully and am unable to find anything which might excuse the respondent`s behavior. I do not agree with the learned magistrate`s assertion that the respondent`s case merited a mere fine and not a custodial sentence because he showed only a `
 warped sense of justice 
` instead of a `
 perverted desire to torture 
`. I do not see how the former sentiment is any less appalling than the latter. We are not so inured in apathy that the savage beating of an animal may arouse our outrage only if it involved some form of torture. Our criminal law is dedicated, after all, not only to preventing cases of extreme depravity but also the more commonplace acts of cruelty committed by thugs like the respondent.
I have also considered the Australian and New Zealand case law which the learned magistrate had diligently traced and cited in an effort to show that custodial sentences had not been imposed by the courts in those jurisdictions for offences involving the cruel abuse of animals. These cases were 
 Christie v Bruce 
[1962] VR 654, a decision of the Supreme Court of the state of Victoria in Australia under the Police Offences Act 1958; 
 West v Harries 
 (1991) 58 A Crim R 86, a case in South Australia under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1985; 
 Hawker v Hammett 
 [1971] NZLR 830, a decision of the Supreme Court of Christchurch in New Zealand under the Animals Protection Act 1960; and 
 Summers v SPCA 
 [1991] 2 NZLR 469, another New Zealand case under the same Act. I do not find those cases relevant for two simple reasons. First, the legislation under consideration in those cases is not in pari materia with our Animals and Birds Act (Cap 7). Secondly, as the magistrate himself noted, a sentencing court has to consider the particular circumstances of each case. As far as I can see, there is little similarity between the facts of each of the cases cited by the magistrate and the facts of this particular case. Moreover, in at least one of the cases cited (
 Christie v Bruce 
), the facts given in the judgment were not entirely clear. The deputy public prosecutor has, in his submissions, analysed and distinguished the cases referred to in the court below; and I do not find it necessary to expand on his painstaking exposition.
Finally, I wish to make clear that I am taking into account the respondent`s two previous convictions for voluntarily causing hurt. I have said before that previous convictions will be considered if they share a common element; and in this case, as I indicated earlier, the respondent`s previous convictions under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 244) disclose the same propensity to violence he has shown in the present offence.
In short, I am of the view that the respondent`s case calls for a custodial sentence. The Public Prosecutor`s appeal is allowed and the respondent is hereby sentenced to one month`s imprisonment with effect from today. I also order that the maximum fine of $500 already paid by him should be paid over to the dog`s owner, Madam Lim Yeok Lan, by way of compensation under s 401(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68).

: This is an appeal against an assistant registrar`s assessment of damages in a claim against a firm of solicitors for negligence in the conduct of a suit.
In or about January 1992, the plaintiff instructed the predecessor of the defendant firm of solicitors to commence a suit against the plaintiff`s former employers, J Kimatrai & Sons Pte Ltd, for bonuses totalling some $2.277m. alleged to be due to the plaintiff for his many years of service with Kimatrai. The suit (No 288/92) was filed on 19 February 1992. In March 1993, the defendant firm (reconstituted from the predecessor firm) took over the conduct of the case. On various dates in the latter part of 1995, procedural orders were made (for filing list of documents, affidavit evidence, setting down and so on). These orders were not complied with. On 17 June 1996, on the application of Kimatrai, an assistant registrar ordered that the plaintiff`s action be dismissed for such failures. The defendants were instructed to file an appeal, but they did not do so in time. Their application for leave to file the appeal out of time was also dismissed.
In July 1997, the plaintiff took out the writ in this action claiming loss arising from the defendants` negligence in the conduct of the previous suit. On 15 December 1997, judgment was entered for damages to be assessed. The assessment was undertaken by assistant registrar Audrey Lim.
The learned assistant registrar correctly stated the principle applicable, as laid down in the leading case of 
Kitchen v Royal Air Force Association
 
[1958] 2 All ER 241
. The principle is that if the plaintiff can satisfy the court that he had some prospect of success in the initial claim, the court should evaluate the prospects. Unless the court is satisfied that the claim was bound to fail, something more than nominal damages should be awarded. The object of the assessment is to put a monetary value on the chance that was lost.
The learned assistant registrar approached the matter by considering the factors that would have been in favour of and those that would have been against the plaintiff in the original suit. She came to the view on balance that the plaintiff would probably have had a 20% chance of success in the original suit. She then applied that percentage to the total of the plaintiff`s claim, and awarded the plaintiff the sum of $455,505.78. She also awarded interest in the sum of $153,788.73, making a total of more than $600,000.
 The background facts 
 
 
 
The facts which emerged from the assessment proceedings and from evidence filed in the summary judgment application in the original suit, briefly, are as follows. Kimatrai was part of a group of companies owned largely by a Pakistani family of that name. The group had subsidiaries and associates in many countries, including countries in other parts of South-East Asia and Japan. One of Kimatrai`s main lines of business was in the import and export of textiles. The plaintiff started working for the company many years ago. It is not clear what year exactly that was. The plaintiff says it was 1971. Mr Ramchand Kimatrai says it was 1976. In any event, after some time, the plaintiff was put in charge of the export department as its manager. The plaintiff says it was one or two years after he joined. But he also says it was in 1977 or 1978. Mr Kimatrai says it was in 1978. Either then, or two or three years later (the evidence again differs), the plaintiff discussed with Ramchand Kimatrai (who was the chairman of the company) the question of bonus payments. According to the plaintiff, it was agreed that he would be paid an annual bonus on all sales in the department at the rate of 2% for the period 1 April 1983 to 31 March 1984, and 3.5% from 1 April 1984 onwards. But according to Mr Kimatrai, the agreement was that the plaintiff would get 19%, but it was to be based on the nett realised profits of the export department. A crucial issue in the original suit was which of these vitally different versions was correct.
The plaintiff supported his claim in the original suit by three documents whose authencity was vigorously challenged by Kimatrai. The first was a letter on Kimatrai`s letterhead dated 4 April 1991 bearing the signature of Mr Khemchand Anandani, a director of Kimatrai. The letter purported to set out a tabulation of the years from 1 April 1983 to 31 March 1989 for which the plaintiff`s bonuses had and had not been paid. It purported to ask the plaintiff to confirm that he had received the following payments, ie in respect of the financial year 1 April 1983 to 31 March 1984, he had received two sums, ie $30,000 in 1994 and $34,000 in 1995, in full settlement, and in respect of the financial year 1 April 1985 to 31 March 1986, he had received in 1991 the sum of $31,543 as part payment. The letter concluded by saying: 
 
We confirm that your commission for year 1986 onwards have not been settled as yet owing to slight liquidity flow congestion.
 
 
 
The second document was a telex allegedly sent on 29 August 1991 from the plaintiff to Mr Anandani in which the plaintiff purportedly demanded the payment of the balance of the bonus for the years from April 1984 to March 1992. The third document purported to be a reply telex from Mr Anandani dated 30 August 1991 confirming that apart from the payment of $31,543 in 1991, the commission from April 1985 onwards had not been settled.
Anandani in an affidavit filed in the original suit strenuously denied the authenticity of these documents. He said he saw them for the first time only when they were exhibited to the plaintiff`s affidavit in support of the plaintiff`s application for summary judgment; he had not seen any of the documents before. Among other things, Anandani said that the matter of commission payment was entirely between Mr Kimatrai and the plaintiff. There was no reason for Anandani to interfere by writing the letter. There was dispute about the purported signature of Anandani against the post-script at the bottom portion of the document. There were other hotly contested points about the alleged letter and telexes, which I do not need to go into.
The learned assistant registrar took into consideration the fact that there was a serious dispute about what was agreed in regard to the bonus payments, and the fact that the only documents in support of the plaintiff`s case were these highly contentious documents. She took into consideration the evidence that the margin of profit for the textile department was of the order of 3 to 4% (according to the witness Kailash) or 1-2%, with a maximum of 3% (according to Anandani), evidence suggesting that it would have been unlikely for the company to agree to the scale of commission alleged by the plaintiff.
On the other hand, the learned assistant registrar thought that there were some factors in favour of the plaintiff. There were the three documents which might have been found to be in his favour. On the basis that the plaintiff`s commission was based on the profit of the export department as alleged by Kimatrai, she said it had not been shown that the export department had not made any profit. There was also evidence suggesting that the company might have manipulated the invoices so that the profit was suppressed.
From the fact that she gave the case a 20% chance of success, it is clear that the learned assistant registrar found that the factors against the plaintiff far outweighed those in his favour. The plaintiff contends that she was too conservative; the defendants contend that she was too generous. Who is right?
On a review of the matter, I thought it might fairly be said that certain matters, to do with the credibility of the plaintiff`s case, should have been taken into consideration in addition to those referred to by the learned assistant registrar. This was a case of one man`s word against another. A trial court, in deciding where the truth lies, is bound to test the credibility of the evidence from both sides against the conduct of the parties at the time and the known facts and circumstances of the case. In this respect, it is pertinent to note that the claimed sum of $2.277m had accumulated over a period of nearly eight years, as follows:

On the plaintiff`s case, these commissions would have formed the overwhelming bulk of the plaintiff`s emoluments. As shown in the disputed letter mentioned earlier, the plaintiff apparently had been paid only three small sums. The failure to pay such substantial portions of an employee`s emoluments over such a long time would on any reasonable view have been a serious breach of the employment contract, and yet the plaintiff carried on working for the company. Not only did he carry on; he seems to have carried on without any complaint or protest. In the absence of a reasonable explanation, I think it can be assumed that this conduct of the plaintiff would have had an adverse effect on the credibility of his case.
The audited accounts of the company for none of the years in question made any provision for these substantial liabilities. The plaintiff on at least four occasions, 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1990, signed the accounts as secretary with Anandani as director. He would have known of the omissions. So, not only did he not protest, he seems to have positively affirmed the omissions. In the absence of a reasonable explanation, again, it can be assumed that this conduct of the plaintiff would also have thrown serious doubt on the credibility of his case.
Another factor to be taken into account is the company`s ability to satisfy any judgment which the plaintiff might have obtained. The brief facts are these. For the year ended 31 March 1991, the company`s accounts already showed a substantial loss of $1.6m. Shareholders had to inject capital of some $2m. There is evidence that in 1993 and 1994 banks withdrew credit lines. By 1994, the company`s business had come to a stand-still. There is evidence of an outstanding judgment against the company of some $4.5m. So, by the time the original suit would have been decided, say, in the middle of 1996, the ability of the company to meet any judgment obtained by the plaintiff would have been in serious doubt.
It seemed to me that if the learned assistant registrar had taken into account all these factors in addition to those she had taken into account, she might well have thought that the 20% chance, particularly as it was to be applied to the large base of $2.277m, would be excessive as a measure of the value of the prospect of success in the original suit.
In the circumstances, I thought it right to substantially reduce the damages awarded to the plaintiff. Giving the matter the best consideration I could, I thought an appropriate amount should not be more than $200,000 (inclusive of any interest) overall. I so decided.

 The appellant was convicted on the following count and sentenced to five and a half years` imprisonment: 
 
You, Abdul Rahim bin Ali, are charged that you, between October to December 1988 over a telephone conversation at or about 10am to 11am did conspire with one Ahmad bin Basir by engaging with him to commit theft as a servant of 168 metric tons of plastic resin amounting to $581,000 in the possession of Chang Fong Overseas Enterprise Pte Ltd, at No 31 Gul Circle, Singapore, and in pursuance of the said conspiracy and in order to the commission of theft, you, during the period between the month of December 1988 to February 1989, supplied motor-lorries and instructed the drivers to proceed to the said company`s premises whereupon the said Ahmad bin Basir loaded the plastic resin on to the motor lorries and the plastic resin was subsequently transported out of the said company`s premises under your instructions, and you have thereby abetted the commission of the offence of theft as a servant, which offence has been committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 109 read with s 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The owner of the plastic resin was Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd (`Nagase`). The plastic resin was stored in the warehouse of Chang Fong Overseas Enterprise Pte Ltd (`Chang Fong`). It was not disputed that Chang Fong had possession of the plastic resin. Ahmad bin Basir (`Ahmad`) worked as a storekeeper and forklift operator for Chang Fong at the relevant time.
 The prosecution`s evidence
The general manager
Shue Teng Lee, the general manager of Nagase testified that following a robbery of Nagase`s goods on 5 March 1989, a stocktake was carried out which revealed that the amount of plastic resin missing was much more than what the security guard reported was taken. On 10 March 1989, the police recovered the plastic resin stolen in the robbery. Approximately 40 tonnes were recovered. 168 tonnes, valued at $580,000, were still unaccounted for. During the previous stocktake on 30 November 1988, no plastic resin was missing.
 The lorry drivers
Three of the lorry drivers involved in transporting the plastic resin from the warehouse gave evidence for the prosecution. There was no suggestion that they were in any way involved in the theft apart from being mere innocent agents.
Selamat bin Keman (`Selamat`) testified that in 1989, the appellant asked for his assistance to take some goods from Ahmad at Gul Circle and deliver them to a place at Penjuru Road. The appellant told him that it was plastic. Selamat did not remember if the appellant said anything else. Ahmad loaded the plastic resin onto the lorry with a forklift and told him to go to Penjuru Road. On the way out, Selamat stopped at the guardhouse and handed to the security guard a delivery order which Ahmad had given him earlier. He could not remember if the security guard checked his lorry.
Selamat met a Chinese man at Penjuru Road. Selamat handed to the Chinese man some documents which Ahmad had given him. The goods were unloaded. He took back the documents, went to see the appellant and delivered the documents to him. The appellant gave him $200. When Selamat asked him what the money was for, the appellant said that it was for petrol and his services.
Some two or three days later, Selamat was approached by the appellant once more to deliver goods. Again, plastic resin was transported from Nagase at Gul Circle to Penjuru Road. He could not recall if he was met by the same Chinese man. This time, the appellant paid Selamat $100.
Abdul Khalid bin Abdul Rahman (`Abdul Khalid`) testified that the appellant had on one occasion, in late 1988, asked for his help in transporting some goods from Chang Fong to Southern Cross`s warehouse. The appellant told him to see Ahmad at Gul Circle. There, Ahmad loaded the goods onto the lorry. Ahmad also gave him two delivery orders, one of which was a copy. Abdul Khalid gave one to the security guard and the other to the appellant when he delivered the goods to Southern Cross. The appellant unloaded the goods with a forklift. There was nobody else there. The appellant gave him $100. The goods were plastic material.
Paradidason s/o Krishnasamy (`Paradidason`) testified that the appellant approached him around 1988 or 1989 and requested him to collect some goods from Nagase and deliver them to Penjuru Road. Paradidason said that he did not know Penjuru Road. The appellant sent someone called Ali with him. The appellant told him to see Ahmad. The appellant did not say what the goods were, but they were plastic resin.
Ahmad loaded the goods unto the lorry and gave him three documents. He was instructed to give one to the security guard, which he did. Paradidason could not remember how many bags were loaded. Ali directed Paradidason to Penjuru Road. There, Ali went into a store and came out with a Chinese man, who unloaded the goods with a forklift. When this was done, they went back to Southern Cross`s warehouse. The appellant then gave Paradidason $100, which he accepted after asking what it was for and was told `Never mind keep it, it`s just like coffee money.` This was the only occasion, and he never saw Ali again.
 Ahmad
Ahmad`s evidence was that he knew the appellant when they were both working at a company called Southern Chemicals (which was different from Southern Cross) at Jurong Port in 1984. In 1987, Ahmad left Jurong Port and went to Chang Fong. He did not remain in contact with the appellant until the appellant paged him towards the end of 1988. Ahmad returned the call. The appellant asked Ahmad how he was and asked him about his work. He then told Ahmad that there was some plastic materials which could be `brought out` from Chang Fong.
Ahmad said that he would think about it and would call the appellant. At about noon, Ahmad called the appellant and told him that the plastic resin could be `taken out` from Chan Fong that day or the following day. They agreed that the appellant would pay him $800 for every tonne of plastic resin. The next day, the appellant sent a lorry. It was understood that by `brought out` or `taken out`, Ahmad meant the theft of these items.
On the first occasion, the lorry driver was Ali. The appellant had given Ahmad the name of the driver and the registration number of the lorry. Ahmad loaded about 160 bags or 4 tonnes of plastic resin that time. Ahmad gave a copy of a delivery order to the driver and told him to hand it to the security guard. Ahmad then contacted the appellant. Subsequently, the appellant gave Ahmad the money at a bowling alley in Jurong. He received $3,200 that day
Ahmad could not remember on how many occasions plastic resin was removed from the warehouse. The first time was in late 1988. Ahmad resigned from Chang Fong in March 1989. He estimated that plastic resin was stolen from the warehouse about four times a month. Sometimes the appellant arranged for the lorries; at other times, Ahmad did. He did not know where the lorries went. He only loaded them.
Ahmad`s explanation of his modus operandi was that on the day of the theft, he obtained a copy of the delivery order for a genuine transaction from the security guard, sometimes under the pretext that there was an error. He handed that copy to the driver and told him to give it to the security guard on the way out. Ahmad knew that the security guard would not check it against the goods in the lorry because he had observed the guard. In order to keep the security guard from asking questions, he was `good` to him.
There were other drivers, including Selamat, Abdul Khalid, `Bala` (Paradidason) and John. He could not remember the rest. For Selamat, Abdul Khalid and Bala, it was Ahmad who arranged for them to collect the goods. He had discussed it with the appellant. On these occasions, he asked the driver to send the goods to the appellant at his workplace. He was certain that the appellant worked at Penjuru Road. He had also been to Penjuru Road where the appellant handed him money. There was no agreement between them as to what was to be done with the plastic resin after they were removed from the warehouse. He did not know where the appellant sold the plastic resin.
Ahmad testified that he did not remember how much he received from the appellant altogether. The money was paid to him at various places. Sometimes, it was through Ali and John. In the agreed statement of facts tendered upon his guilty plea for theft, it was stated that he received $88,200. However, he accepted that based on a calculation of how much was stolen, he had received $134,400. According to Ahmad, he spent half of it and gave the other half to his wife.
 The investigating officer
Robert Teo (`Teo`) was then the investigating officer. At that time, he was a police sergeant. He admitted that he had not followed up the lead on the Chinese man. Neither had he interviewed John or asked the security guard about the events leading to the loss of the plastic resin. His evidence was that at the time, he was more concerned with investigating a robbery, and not the theft. He had interviewed Selamat, Paradidason and Abdul Khalid. He had also interviewed one Mohd Sani, who was also known as Ali. Mohd Sani is deceased. A statement made by Mohd Sani (`P5`) to Teo was admitted after the defence`s objection was overruled. It suffices to say that P5 implicated the appellant.
 The defence
The appellant`s evidence was that it was Ahmad who contacted him by visiting him at his workplace at Southern Cross. On the first occasion, the appellant was unable to attend to him as he was busy with work. Ahmad visited the appellant a second time and told him that he had some scrap and damaged material for sale. Ahmad asked if the appellant knew of any rag and bones man who might buy the items. The appellant did not make any suggestion on that occasion.
Ahmad subsequently telephoned the appellant. The appellant told him that there was someone called Ali who would buy them. The appellant gave Ahmad Ali`s telephone number. After this, Ahmad called again on another day. He asked for a lorry and a driver. The appellant then requested one of the drivers to go with Ali. The appellant did not go with them. On that occasion, the lorry did not return, and neither did Ali. He did not know what Ali discussed with Ahmad. The appellant said that he had never sold anything, whether scrap material or otherwise, for Ahmad or Ali.
The appellant could not remember how many times he had asked lorries to go to Ahmad`s workplace. He could not remember how many times Ahmad asked for a lorry and driver. It was a long time ago. Ahmad would give the appellant `coffee money` whenever he asked the appellant to send for a lorry. The appellant testified that he could not remember how many times Ahmad had given him money and how much he had received.
On occasions, Ali would give the appellant a delivery order and an envelope and ask that he hand them to Ahmad. The appellant did not know what was in the envelope. The appellant denied giving sums of money to Ahmad. He denied knowing anything about Penjuru Road. However, he admitted giving money to the drivers. Ahmad gave him some money and he passed it to the drivers. Ahmad told him to hand the money to the drivers.
 The finding below
The district judge accepted the prosecution`s argument that P5 was admissible by virtue of s 32(c) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). He did not accept the argument that P5 was not admissible under s 379(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) without the leave of the court.
The district judge found it hard to accept the appellant`s evidence. There was no reason why Ahmad would keep asking the appellant for help in arranging transport when Ahmad was constantly in contact with lorry drivers himself. There was certainly no need to do this after the first few occasions. Furthermore, the appellant`s evidence was contradicted by those of the drivers. The fact that $100 to $200 was paid for each trip was also suspicious, and would have aroused the appellant`s suspicion if what he said was true.
The district judge was addressed on the inconsistencies in Ahmad`s evidence. However, he did not think that, looking at the matter in totality, there was any major discrepancy. In doing so, he took into consideration the fact that it had been a long time since the incidents, and that Ahmad was not well versed in English. The district judge, however, accepted that Ahmad had not been candid in telling the court how much he received or what he had done with the money. He did not think that this was important.
The district judge was mindful that Ahmad was an accomplice and his evidence should be treated with caution. However, he was satisfied that his evidence was corroborated by that of the lorry drivers. He did not think that Ahmad was fabricating evidence against the appellant. As for the deficiencies in the investigating officer`s investigations, the district judge did not think that it revealed any gap in the prosecution`s evidence.
 Issues on appeal
Admissibility of P5
It was not necessary for me to decide whether ss 378 and 379 of the CPC displaced s 32 of the Evidence Act. There was no doubt that P5 was a statement made to a police officer in the course of a police investigation. Hence, s 122 of the CPC applied. This states:
 
 
(1) Except as provided in this section, no statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation made under this Chapter shall be used in evidence other than a statement that is a written statement admissible under section 141. 
 
(3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to any statement made in the course of an identification parade or falling within section 27 or 32(a) of the Evidence Act.
  
 
 
Section 141 of the CPC and s 27 of the Evidence Act were not relevant. As P5 was sought to be admitted under s 32(c) of the Evidence Act, the exceptions stated in s 122(3) did not apply to P5. Section 122(3) makes a specific exception only for evidence admissible under s 32(a) of the Evidence Act. It was therefore beyond argument that the exception did not cover evidence admissible only under s 32(c). As no other exception was applicable, s 122(1) of the CPC applied and P5 should not have been admitted.
However, the admission of inadmissible evidence is an irregularity which can be cured if no miscarriage of justice has occurred. No miscarriage of justice would have occurred if the appellate court can be certain that the trial court would have come to the same conclusion if the wrongly admitted evidence had been excluded. I need refer only to

 The other evidence
Turning to the other evidence, I agreed with counsel that certain aspects of Ahmad`s evidence were not satisfactory. The district judge had already observed that he was less than candid as to what he did with the money. In addition, Ahmad`s evidence that it was the appellant who contacted him first was not wholly convincing. It seemed strange that the appellant would call Ahmad out of the blue after a period of over one year and ask him to participate in a theft of goods from his employers.
"">There were gaps in Ahmad`s description of how he ensured that the lorries could leave the warehouse with the goods undetected. His evidence that he gave a copy of the delivery order to the driver to hand over to the security guard clearly did not tell the whole story, for the drivers` testimonies showed that, in each case, they received more than one copy of the delivery order from Ahmad. Ahmad was also not altogether consistent about where he obtained the copy of the delivery note from. At times, he said it was from the security guard; at others, he mentioned the clerk.
Likewise, it appeared from the evidence that Mohd Sani played a not insignificant role in the whole matter. Paradidason`s evidence suggested that Mohd Sani was involved in more than merely arranging transport. His dealing with the unknown Chinese man indicated that he was not a mere driver.
Nevertheless, the following facts had been established. Firstly, there was no doubt that there had been a theft of 168 tonnes of Nagase`s plastic resin from the warehouse by Ahmad. This could only be done by using lorries. It was not disputed that the lorry drivers, apart from Mohd Sani and possibly John, were not involved in any conspiracy. It had been proven that there was an arrangement between Ahmad and the appellant under which lorries and drivers would be procured.
Selamat and Paradidason`s evidence was that it was the appellant who asked them to deliver the goods from Nagase to Penjuru Road. Had this been all, there would be some merit in counsel`s argument that the drivers` evidence was equivocal, in that it was also consistent with the appellant`s claim that he thought he was only helping Ahmad in selling scrap material.
However, Selamat`s evidence went further. After delivering the goods to Penjuru Road, he went back to the appellant, who paid him sums of $100 or $200. This was leaving aside his evidence that he handed a copy of the delivery order to the appellant. There was no dispute that $100 and $200 were not normal `coffee money` for making such a trip.
Furthermore, Abdul Khalid`s evidence was that, at the request of the appellant, he delivered his load of plastic resin to 
 the appellant 
, who unloaded them with a forklift. On this occasion, he was paid $100 by the appellant. The request by the appellant, together with the payment of $100, would remove any possibility that it was just another normal and legitimate delivery in the ordinary course of Abdul Khalid`s work that was mistaken for one of the unlawful ones. Abdul Khalid`s evidence directly implicated the appellant.
Thus, even excluding P5 and attaching much less weight to Ahmad`s evidence that there was an agreement between him and the appellant, the evidence showed: (1) theft of 168 tonnes of plastic resin from the warehouse; (2) an arrangement between Ahmad and the appellant to procure lorries and drivers to transport the plastic resin; (3) the appellant requested the drivers to transport the plastic resin; (4) the appellant paid the drivers $100 or $200 for each trip; (5) on at least one occasion, the plastic resin was delivered to the appellant who unloaded them himself and paid the driver.
In the circumstances, even assuming that Teo`s investigations were incomplete and that there were other possible members of the conspiracy, such as the unknown Chinese man, Mohd Sani and even John, the almost irresistible inference was that the appellant was part of the conspiracy to steal the plastic resin and that he played a part, pursuant to the conspiracy, in the transportation of the stolen plastic resin. Seen in the light of the established facts, the appellant`s defence that he merely arranged for the lorries and drivers because he was asked by Ahmad, that he had merely passed to the drivers what Ahmad gave him, that he merely introduced Mohd Sani to Ahmad, and that he took no part in the disposal of the plastic resin, could not be true.
In conclusion, even if P5 had been disregarded and little weight was given to Ahmad`s evidence, the court could still safely say that the district judge would nevertheless have come to the same conclusion. Ahmad`s evidence remained amply corroborated by independent testimony. There was no miscarriage of justice and I upheld the conviction for abetting theft by a servant. The appeal against sentence was abandoned and I need not deal with it. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.

Any person who

 shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000.
65
At the end of the trial below, the respondent was acquitted of the two similar charges without having her defence called.
65
The prosecution appealed against the acquittal. At the conclusion of the hearing on 13 March 1997, I allowed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 The facts
65
On 16 April 1996, the anti-vice officers from CID carried out a sting at a hotel in Rangoon Road. Two male anti-vice officers, Cpl Lim Seng Chuan (PW5) and Cpl Lim Eng Yong (PW6), checked into one of the rooms at the hotel and the latter dialled a number 7334267 provided by his supervisor to procure the services of two prostitutes.
65
Cpl Lim Eng Yong spoke to a female, one Anna, to book two prostitutes. After making the booking, he informed DSI Lim Yew Boon (PW8) who was back at CID office. DSI Lim screened the number 7334267 through the police radio division and was able to confirm that all calls to that number had been transferred to a handphone by the number 98183928.
65
When the prostitutes arrived, they said they were sent by Anna and were to receive $200 each. There was some negotiation over the price, and one of them requested permission to call Anna to tell her that she had arrived. At this point, a woman sergeant emerged from a cupboard in the room and detained the two prostitutes.
65
The two prostitutes were questioned by S/Sgt Johnny Cheah (PW10). They said they were sent to the hotel by a male Chinese in a car, identified as one Lim How Kim (Lim) who was also PW4. The officers then asked one of them to call Lim. They complied and were instructed by Lim to meet him at a car park at Kent Road. The prostitutes proceeded there with the officers following them. When Lim subsequently arrived in a car SBC 8968R, he was detained.
65
The two prostitutes and Lim were brought to CID for investigation while the other officers proceeded to 128 Loyang Rise. Only two maids and the respondent`s daughter were at the premises. The respondent and her husband, Tan Choo Peek, were arrested later when they returned home. A search was then conducted at the premises to find, inter alia, the handphone. But, it was unsuccessful and nothing incriminating was found.
 The decision below
65
At the end of the prosecution`s case, the trial judge was not satisfied that a case against the respondent had been made out with respect to the two charges.
65
In so far as relevant, he held as follows: 
The court accepted counsel`s submission that the evidence of PW2 and PW3 [the two prostitutes] clearly showed that no money earned by them was taken by both accused [one of whom was the respondent]. They worked for PW4 [Lim] and they did not know [the respondent] at all and PW4 was very clear in his evidence that he took their earnings because they had worked for him. He had also pleaded guilty to this charge. The court accordingly acquitted [the respondent] on DAC 7763/96 and 7764/96.
The prosecution`s evidence showed that PW5 and PW6 made some calls. The numbers were not known and even so a female voice answered. The negotiation was made by PW5 and PW6 at the hotel for negotiated price but there was also no evidence to show who answered the phone call. The call was made to 7334267 which is the phone number of Phoenix Escort Agency and although this was owned by [the respondent], it goes no further. Although on 16 April 1996 it was relayed to No 98183928, there was no evidence as to who spoke to PW5 far more so it being [the respondent]. Being a handphone access could be obtained by any person. There was no evidence regarding the voice who answered the phone to be [the respondent].
More importantly, PW4 stated that he did not know both the accused at all. He never gave the money to the first accused from the earnings of the prostitution. [The respondent] had never asked him to send girls to the hotel and finally there was no incriminating evidence in the statements.
 Issues in the appeal
65
To make out a case under s 146 of the Women`s Charter against the respondent, it was necessary to prove that she had done the following: 
(a) knowingly lived; 
(b) wholly or in part; 
(c) on the earnings of the prostitution of another person.
65
In this respect, there were two critical questions to be answered. First, whether it could reasonably be inferred that the Anna whom Cpl Lim Eng Yong booked the prostitutes from was the respondent; this would prove element (a). Second, whether the respondent had received a cut of the prostitutes` earnings through Lim; this would prove elements (b) and (c).
65
Thus, the issue was whether there was prima facie evidence to answer these two questions in the affirmative. If there was, then the trial judge had misdirected himself when he concluded that the respondent had no case to answer.
65
Hence, the exercise in this appeal was to consider what were the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the primary facts.
 The appeal
Prostitutes` evidence
65
The evidence of the two prostitutes, Ling Swee Ling (PW2) and Lee Phui Yoke (PW3), were similar as to how they operated. Whenever their services were required, Lim would contact and send them in his car to meet the customer in a hotel or apartment. Upon arriving at the meeting place, they were to make a telephone call to the number 7334267 where a female voice would answer and tell them the amount to collect for their services. After the assignment was completed, another call would be made to the same number to inform her that the work was done, and they would proceed downstairs to wait for Lim`s car.
65
The prostitutes testified that the whole sum of money paid by the customer was given to Lim solely, and they received $70 each time, irrespective of the negotiated price with the customer. This was the arrangement up to the time of their arrests. As far as the prostitutes knew, Lim kept the rest of the money. Neither of them had seen the person with the female voice, whom they addressed as `Auntie` or `Miss Tan`.
65
Therefore, from the prostitutes` evidence, all that could be ascertained was that the person with the female voice would undoubtedly know that they were prostitutes and that Lim worked with her.
Lim How Kim`s evidence
65
Lim had pleaded guilty earlier in DAC 7759/96 to one count of managing a place of assignation and two counts of knowingly living on the earnings of the prostitution of another. He admitted that the prostitutes worked for him. However, he testified that he decided on the amount to charge every time and denied knowing the respondent or her husband.
65
The prosecution therefore applied to cross-examine Lim under s 147 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). As far as relevant, Lim said the following in cross-examination by the prosecution: 
I have heard the name Anna. I have not seen her. I knew the names from the newspaper advertisement. This is in relation to - I do not know - permanent wave saloon. I have ever spoken to Anna. She has never called me but I have phoned her from the newspaper particulars. I am in this line. I call her if she has customers for my girls. If there were customers she would call back.
 
I did receive some calls but I do not know who the caller was. The caller wanted to tell me to send me to various places. He or she contacted me over the phone, my handphone. Its number is 8245913. This person who called is a female. I agreed to supply girls. I was informed of the price the customers were to pay and I would tell my girls to collect from customers. The number is 7334267.
 
On my part I send the girls to a certain place, tell her how much to collect and wait for her return downstairs. This number 7334267 - I do not know if the girls know. Sometimes I ask them to contact this number, sometimes my number. I told the girls to phone this number to inform the other side the girl had arrived.
65
With regard to the events on the day of his arrest, he said: 
On this day, caller of 7334267 asked me to send the girls there. I did so. The money would be handed to me by the girls - all money they receive. My cut ie if it is $150, I will get $110 and 
 the one who introduced the customers would get $40. It would be the caller at 7334267. I would receive a call from this number and would be asked to go to various places at City Plaza. There would be people waiting for me there. I will be given the registration number of a car. I go up to it and hand over the money to the driver. The car number is 8338.
 I cannot remember the prefix or suffix. It is a Mercedes. I do not know the size. It is white. [Emphasis added.]
65
The above testimony would have provided evidence to prove the complicity of the respondent and her husband who owns a white Mercedes with the same registration number. It connected the prostitutes with the Anna of the newspaper advertisement whose contact number was 7334267. It also showed that Anna received a commission for her work. Since this Anna introduced the customers and was paid a commission, she would be knowingly living on the earnings of prostitution of another person.
65
However, when cross-examined by defence counsel, Lim`s answers were in material contradiction to the answers he gave when the prosecution questioned him: 
Q: Whatever the girls were paid were given to them at end of the day. The rest is yours? 
A: Yes. 
Q: 
 You did not pay anybody any commission? 
 
A: No. 
[Emphasis added.]
65
The trial judge, however, concluded as follows: 
6 At the end of [Lim`s] evidence, the prosecution did not invite the court to impeach his credit notwithstanding the fact that he had cross-examined this witness. As there was nothing to contradict his evidence the court accepted the whole of his evidence. 
 
12 The court accepted counsel`s submission that the evidence of PW2 and PW3 [the two prostitutes] clearly showed that no money earned by them was taken by both accused [one of whom was the respondent]. They worked for PW4 [Lim] and they did not know [the respondent] at all and PW4 was very clear in his evidence that he took their earnings because they had worked for him. He had also pleaded guilty to this charge. The court accordingly acquitted [the respondent] on DAC 7763/96 and 7764/96.
65
Obviously, the trial judge was wrong when he said that there was nothing to contradict Lim`s evidence in court because his evidence regarding the commission issue was a material contradiction. Effectively, what Lim did was to give two accounts. On one account, he kept all the money; on the other, he gave a commission to his introducer.
65
However, the prosecution was not obliged to impeach Lim`s credit. If the prosecution chose not to impeach its own witness who had given unfavourable evidence during examination-in-chief, then it simply ran the risk that the court would later accept this unfavourable account at the end of the trial. But, the court could also decide later to reject the evidence-in-chief of the witness, and accept the answers he gave during cross-examination under s 147 of the Evidence Act.
65
The court did not have to make an election between the two versions at this stage since credit would not usually be an issue at the close of the prosecution case. It could simply assume that the version favourable to the prosecution was true and draw the reasonable inferences from it.
65
However, another view would be that if Lim`s evidence was so contradictory, then it must be manifestly unreliable and the court should disregard it completely: see 
 PP v IC Automation (S) Pte Ltd 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 249
 and [para ] 43 below. This view was persuasive because Lim, who was the prosecution witness, had given self-contradictory versions on the stand.
65
Therein lay the difficulty of the prosecution`s case. Apart from Lim`s answer during his cross-examination under s 147 of the Evidence Act that he would pay his introducer from the prostitutes` earnings, there was no other 
 direct 
 evidence that this Anna would have received any money or commission from their earnings. And, if it could not be proved that a commission was paid, then it could not be shown that this Anna was living on the earnings of prostitution of another person which was an essential ingredient for a s 146 Women`s Charter offence.
65
The only direct evidence regarding payment to the introducer was found in Lim`s testimony in court, and he had contradicted himself materially over it on the stand. Thus, it might be said that Lim`s evidence regarding the payment of a commission was so inherently weak that it was manifestly unreliable and hence to be disregarded.
65
My view, however, was that even if this court accepted such an argument and disregarded Lim`s evidence totally, the other evidence was already sufficient to give rise to the reasonable inference that the respondent had received payment, at least in part, from the earnings of the prostitutes. I shall explain.
Handphone
65
According to the respondent`s police statement recorded by S/Sgt Johnny Cheah on 17 April 1996, she said that she ran two companies called `Anna Unisex Beauty Salon` and `Phoenix Escort Agency`, both of which were registered at her home address. The number 7334267 was the number which customers would call whenever they needed an escort or a facial treatment, and she would despatch a beautician or escort to the customer.
65
However, the respondent said that this number 7334267 was no longer connected to her house. Instead, it would lead to her handphone of which she was the subscriber. She also conceded that she was the only one using this handphone and no one else had used it. But, she claimed that she had lost her handphone 
 a few days ago 
. Presumably, this meant a few days before her statement was recorded on 17 April 1996. She said it was left in a coffeeshop in Changi. She further added, in her police statement recorded on 18 April 1996, that she had informed her husband about the loss of her handphone a few days ago. However, she did not ask him to make a report and was not sure if he did.
65
This account was, however, contradicted by her husband who, in his police statement made on 17 April 1996, answered as follows: 
Q: Who is the subscriber of tel no 98183928? 
A: I do not know the subscriber of this handphone number. I am not sure if I had this tel no. 
Q: Where is this handphone no 98183928 now? 
A: I do not know where is it now. I think it is lost. 
Q: Have you made any report to TAS or the police? 
A: I called up TAS at 169 and informed that the handphone had lost. 
 It was about two or three months back 
. 
[Emphasis added.]
65
He also claimed, in a police statement recorded on 18 April 1996, that he was the one who lost the handphone and this was probably at Newton Hawker Centre about two or three months ago. He further claimed to have informed the respondent about the loss a few days after it was misplaced.
65
Shanti Tanjit Kaur (PW11), the senior customer service officer at Mobile Link, TAS, testified that her records showed that the handphone belonged to the respondent. From her records, it was apparent that calls were previously connected between Lim`s handphone and the respondent`s handphone as well as the number 7334267. Even on the day of Lim`s arrest itself, the records showed that such calls were similarly connected.
65
More significantly, Pushpa Varani (PW12) who is the customer service executive of Singapore Telecom, testified that according to a letter dated 6 May 1996 from Mobile Link to S/Sgt Johnny Cheah, there was no report of any loss and the handphone was in fact transferred from the respondent to her husband on 24 April 1996. The letter stated as follows: 
This is in reply to your questions posed to us with reference to the above handphone [98183928].
 
(i) No, there was no report made to the lost (sic) of this handphone. 
(ii) The procedure for lost (sic) of handphone is the subscriber has to inform Singapore Telecom and also to make a police report. 
(iii) The present subscriber of this handphone is Mr Tan Choo Peek [the respondent`s husband]. 
The previous subscriber was Mdm Liew Kim Choo [the respondent]. 
(iv) This handphone was transferred on 24 April 1996.
65
The testimony here was crucial because it refuted any claim that the handphone was lost as alleged by the respondent and her husband in their police statements made on 
 17 April 1996 
. In the light of this evidence, the reasonable inference to draw was that the handphone was 
 not 
 lost at all. Otherwise, its transfer to the respondent`s husband could not have taken place after the purported loss.
Advertisement in newspaper
65
I turned next to the evidence of Tay Guek Hoong (PW9) who used to work with Singapore Press Holdings as a telephone sales representative. She testified that the respondent had called to place an advertisement and its wording was confirmed with her. Based on a direct translation, the advertisement read: 
Facial cleansing for males only. 
 From here and abroad
. If interested, 
 call Miss Anna at 7334267
. [Emphasis added.]
This advertisement was placed in the 
 Sin Min Jit Poh 
 six times between 1 February 1996 and 16 April 1996. Its relevance to the prosecution`s case was to show that the respondent had used the advertisement to procure customers for the prostitutes.
65
The respondent did not dispute in her police statement that she was the person who placed the advertisement. When asked during her police interview as to the peculiar wording of the advertisement, the respondent replied that she had told the publisher: `facial service for men, customers can be local or foreign ` However, the publisher had translated it wrongly.
65
I thought it was unusual to indicate that the customers could be local or foreign in that this was only a facial service. In any event, when asked why she did not rectify it, she claimed that she did not notice it in the newspaper because she could not read Mandarin. However, Miss Tay testified that her company did request changes to be made to the advertisement and the respondent had been asked to delete the phrase.
The law
65
The treatment of circumstantial evidence at the close of prosecution`s case was dealt with in 
 Tan Siew Chay v PP 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
. LP Thean J stated, at p 38, the following: 
In considering whether the prosecution has made out a case against the accused, we have to adopt the approach as laid down by Lord Diplock [in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
; [1980-1981] SLR 73], which we have set out earlier. We assume (a) that the evidence on the primary facts is true, unless the evidence is inherently incredible, and (b) that there will be nothing to displace the inference as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of further explanation. 
 The application of limb (b) necessarily involves the court drawing inferences from primary facts, and, in drawing such inferences, the court looks at the totality of the evidence and considers what inference, if any, that can reasonably be drawn therefrom. But, in considering any inference to be drawn, the court at this stage does not apply the test whether the evidence looked at in its totality would inevitably and inexorably lead to only one inference or inferences for establishing the essential elements of the charge
. [Emphasis added.]
65
All that was required at this stage of the proceedings was a minimum evaluation of the evidence as a whole: see 
 Ng Theng Shuang v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 36
. In 
 PP v IC Automation (S) Pte Ltd 
 (supra), this court stated further, at p 255, as follows: 
The totality of the prosecution evidence must be considered. This requirement did not entail picking out all the plums and leaving the duff behind. If the evidence of the witness upon which the prosecution case depended on was self contradictory and out of all common sense or reason, the court is entitled to reach the conclusion that there is no evidence to support an essential ingredient in the charge; alternatively, the evidence may be said to be so inherently weak that it is inherently incredible or manifestly unreliable.
Reasonable inferences drawn from primary facts
65
From the evidence alluded to above, the primary facts of this case could be summed up as follows: 
(a) The female whom Cpl Lim Eng Yong spoke to for the booking of the prostitutes was one Miss Anna. The number he dialled was 7334267. 
(b) The number which the prostitutes had to contact on reaching their customer`s place was also 7334267. It was always the same female voice that answered their calls, although they said that they had never seen this person before. 
(c) Lim clearly worked with this female who communicated with his prostitutes as to the price to charge. 
(d) There was no dispute in the respondent`s police statement that the number 7334267 had been transferred to a handphone by the number 98183928. 
(e) There was no dispute in the respondent`s police statement that this handphone belonged to her and that she was the only person using it, although she claimed that she had lost it a few days before her arrest. 
(f) Records of Singapore Telecom, however, showed that the handphone had not been reported lost. Furthermore, the handphone subscriber was changed from the respondent to her husband even after its purported loss. 
(g) It was not disputed in the respondent`s police statement that she was the person who placed the advertisement in the newspaper. The person to contact as stated in the advertisement was Anna and the contact number was 7334267. 
(h) The advertisement contained a peculiar phrase, suggesting that the service was rendered by persons `from here and abroad`. 
(i) The respondent ran a company called `Anna Unisex Beauty Salon`.
What then were the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the primary facts of this case?
65
The first question here was, `Who was Miss Anna?` No doubt, the trial judge had said that access to the handphone could be obtained by anyone. But, the respondent had said that she was the only one who had use of it. Furthermore, despite her claim that she had lost her handphone a few days earlier, records of Singapore Telecom revealed otherwise. This therefore suggested that the female voice belonged to the respondent who communicated with the prostitutes and took their bookings.
65
The respondent also stated in her police statement that she owned a company called `Anna Unisex Beauty Salon`. Besides, she admitted that she was the person who placed the newspaper advertisement wherein it was stated that any interested party could contact Miss Anna at the number 7334267. Thus, it was reasonable to infer that the Miss Anna whom Cpl Lim contacted at 7334267 for the booking of the prostitutes was the respondent.
65
The question which followed, of course, was whether the respondent was living on the earnings of the two prostitutes. I considered this issue by ignoring Lim`s evidence, the result of which was that there would be no evidence to 
 directly 
 implicate the respondent with having received any commission from the earnings of the two prostitutes.
65
Notwithstanding this, I concluded that there was prima facie evidence to prove that the respondent was receiving some payment for all her efforts. The prostitutes themselves testified that they had to call the number 7334267 to inform the female receiver of their arrival and ask about the price to charge whenever they met their customers. And, since it was reasonable to infer that the respondent was the Miss Anna who made the necessary arrangements for Lim`s prostitutes, there was clearly some basis to think that she was not doing this gratuitously.
65
It might well be that it could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that part of the prostitutes` earnings found its way to the respondent eventually. But that was not the consideration at this stage. What was needed was merely to show that it was reasonable to infer that the respondent was receiving a cut of the prostitutes` earnings through Lim. It seemed to me logical and reasonable to arrive at such an inference. After all, she must be benefiting from her efforts which included the placing of advertisements - she could not have been doing all this work for free.
 Conclusion 
65
In my opinion, a prima facie case against the respondent had been shown for the following reasons: (1) there was evidence not inherently incredible to reasonably infer that the respondent was the person who made the arrangements for the prostitutes; and (2) there was evidence not inherently incredible to reasonably infer that she was receiving payment for this because her efforts were unlikely to be gratuitous.
65
Therefore, the respondent was knowingly living in whole or in part on the earnings of the prostitution of another person under s 146 Women`s Charter, and a prima facie case was made out.
65
Accordingly, I overturned the trial judge`s decision of no case to answer and remitted the case to the court below for the respondent`s defence to be called. The appeal was thus allowed.

: The defendants in this case constitute a well-known firm of certified public accountants.
The plaintiffs` purpose in this action was to recover from the defendants some $1,279,929.70 or $1,392,864.60 as damages.
The basis of the claim in essence was an assertion of breach of professional duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in the valuation of shares.
The central fact of the plaintiffs` case was that the defendants valued a block of shares in a company owned by the plaintiffs at $2.15 per share. A valuer engaged by them valued them between $3.17 and $3.26 each. The higher values were placed by a firm of accountants - KMPG Peat Marwick.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The company whose shares were the subject of valuation was called Chong Lee Seng Company Ltd (`the company`).
In 1989, the plaintiffs in this case (there were eight of them including a limited company) filed a petition to wind up the company on the ground of minority oppression. The petition was not proceeded with as there was an out of court settlement. The essence of the settlement was that the plaintiffs would sell their shares to the other shareholders at a price determined by the defendants on the basis of a fair value as at 31 July 1989. It was agreed that the valuation should not take into account the existence of any legal proceedings between the shareholders or any previous offers by any of the parties pertaining to the sale and purchase of the shares. By the terms of their engagement the defendants were not required to furnish any reasons for their valuation but to merely state what, in their opinion, was the fair value of each share. In short they wanted a non-speaking award.
The shares, in number 1,254,833, constituted 10.56% of the issued and paid up capital of the company. They represented an uninfluential minority. Needless to say, the shares were unquoted in the Stock Exchange.
The person in the defendants` firm who did the valuation was Ong Yew Huat (`Ong`). He said that after the commission he collated and reviewed information and material which would assist him in carrying out the valuation task. Then, one of his staff, by name Thomas Teo, prepared a Summary Memorandum (`the memo`). The memo was dated 2 April 1993. It is appropriate and necessary to set out the full text of the memo: 
 
 
1 General 
 
We have been engaged jointly by Mr Kuah Kok Kim (`KKK`) and Mr Lau Kiat Bin(`LKB`) to determine a fair value for the shares of certain minority shareholders representing 10.56% interest in CLLS as at 31 July 1989. In accordance to their instruction, dated 28 January 1993 (attached in Appendix 1A and 1B), our valuation should not take into account. 
 
(i) he existence of any legal proceedings between the shareholders and the directors/shareholders of the CLLS; or 
 
(ii) any previous offers by the parties or any of them pertaining to the sale and purchase of the said shares. 
 
2 Valuation 
 
We have considered the following valuation bases : 
 
Primary basis 
 
(i) discounting dividend flow or dividends basis; 
 
Secondary bases 
 
(ii) orderly reaslisation of assets or net tangible assets basis; and 
 
(iii) capitalisation of future earnings or price-earning basis. 
 
3 Dividend basis 
 
The investment value of uninfluential minority shareholdings may be best determined by the future stream of dividends they expect to receive and the expected or required rate of return applied to those dividends. The formula to be applied is : 
 
Share value [equals] Gross dividend per share rate of return 
 
CLLS has a good track record of dividend payout over the last five years. It has paid gross dividends of 5 cents in 1987, 10 cents from 1988 to 1990 and 12 cents in 1991. The future stream of gross dividends is expected to be maintainable at a constant rate of 12 cents per annum having regard to future prospect. Please refer to Appendix 2. 
 
The investors` required rate of return is normally bench-marked on a so-called risk-free long term (say 1 year) rate plus a premium determined by the riskiness of the investment and the lack of liquidity. Typical risk-free rates would be the gross redemption yield on long term Government Securities and interest rates on long term fixed deposits. As at 31 July 1989, these are as follows:
  
 
 
 
 
 
(i)
 
12 months
 
Fixed deposits interest rate
 
Banks
 
4.60%
 
 
 
(ii)
 
12 months
 
Fixed deposits interest rate
 
Finance Companies
 
5.04%
 
 
 
(iii)
 
5 years
 
Gross redemption
 
Government yield Securities
 
5.15%
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The above information has been extracted from the MAS monthly statistical bulletin December 1989 issue. Please refer to Appendix 3A & 3B for further details. 
 
If we take the average risk-free rate to be 5%, the value of minority shareholdings in an unlisted company would be S$2.40 per share. However, one would expect the investors to impute a risk premium and require a rate of return that is higher than the risk-free rate for their investment. On this view, the maximum value of the minority shareholdings should not exceed S$2.40 per share. 
 
On the assumption that the investors` required rate of return is 6.00% per annum and at an expected constant gross dividend of 12 cents, we are of the view that the value of the minority shares would be S$2.00 per share using the dividend basis of valuation. 
 
4 Net tangible assets (`NTA`) basis 
 
Uninfluential minority shareholdings should normally not be valued on an net tangible assets basis since the holder is not in a position to reach those assets. However, we have intended to use it as a secondary basis to cross-check the value derive from the primary dividend basis. The audited consolidated balance sheets from 1987 to 1991, summarised in Appendix 4, show that the net tangible assets per share as at 31 July 1989 is S$2.11. 
 
Without applying the lack of liquidity as a depreciatory factor, the NTA is say $2.10. 
 
5 Price-earning (`PE`) basis 
 
The price-earning basis is normally used to value controlling interests or majority shareholdings in which the shareholder may have such control as to distribute all the earnings by way of dividends should he so wish. Again, we have intended to use it only as a secondary basis to cross-check the value derive from the primary dividend basis. The PE formula is as follows : 
 
Share value [equals] Earnings per share x PE multiple 
 
(Earnings are define by net profits after tax & minority interests) 
 
The audited consolidated profit and loss statements from 1987 to 1991, summarised in Appendix 2, shows the average maintainable earnings of the Group to be approximately S$3.2m, or equivalent to 27 cents per share. 
 
In arriving at a average market PE ratio, we referred to the PEs of companies listed in the secondary board of the Singapore Stock Exchange. The average price earning ratio of these companies as at 31 July 1989 was 9.72. Extracts of the price earning ratios from the SES Journal August 1989 issue for SESDAQ companies have been included in Appendix 5. 
 
Before applying a discounting factor for reason of lack of liquidity, the capitalised earnings price is $2.62. 
 
Minority shareholders in an unlisted company suffer considerably from lack of marketability of their holding and for this reason, discount must be at their greatest for the 10.56% uninfluential shareholding. It may vary between 20% to over 50% for such holding. 
 
6 Other share transfers 
 
We noted from the share register of CLLS that some shares held by minority shareholders were sold to external parties in two separate share transfers in 1991 after CLLS became a public company in 1990. The purchase considerations in these two instances were S$2.30 and S$2.00 respectively. 
 
7 Conclusion 
 
Having regard to the value arrived at using the dividend basis and taking into consideration other matters set out above, we are of the opinion that the fair value of the minority shares as at 31 July 1989 is S$2.15 per share.
  
 
 
By way of gilding the lily Ong said this in his affidavit evidence: 
 
 
12 In carrying out the share valuation, we considered and applied the following valuation bases (as shown in pp 14-16 of the SRM): 
 
(i) Primary basis 
 
(a) Discounting Dividend Flow or Dividends Basis 
 
We chose the dividend basis because the investment value of uninfluential minority shareholdings may (in our view) be best determined by the future stream of dividends they expect to receive from the said shares in CLLS and the expected or required rate of return from other unquoted equity investments applied to those dividends. The investor`s required rate of return is normally bench-marked on a so-called risk-free long term (say 1 year) rate plus a premium determined by the riskiness of the investment and the lack of liquidity. Typical risk free rates would be the gross redemption yield on long-term Government Securities or interest rates on long-term fixed deposits. 
 
(ii) Secondary bases 
 
(b) Net Tangible Assets Basis 
 
Uninfluential minority shareholdings should not (in our view) normally be valued on a tangible assets basis since the holder is not in a position to influence the realisation of those assets. However, we used this basis as a secondary basis to cross-check the value derived from the primary dividend basis. 
 
(c) Price Earnings Basis 
 
The price-earning basis is (in our view) normally also used to value controlling interests or majority shareholdings in which the shareholder may have such control as to distribute all the earnings by way of dividends should he so wish. We used this basis only as a secondary basis to cross-check the value derived from the dividend basis. In arriving at an average market price-earning ratio, we referred to the price earnings of companies listed in the secondary board of the Singapore Stock Exchange. 
 
13 We also noted from the share register of CLLS that some shares held by minority shareholders were sold to external parties on two separate transfers in 1991 after CLLS became a public company in 1990. The purchase consideration in these two instances were S$2.30 and S$2.00 respectively. 
 
14 The valuation, in my judgement, did reflect the fair value of the shares as at 31 July 1989.
  
 
 
 
 
 
4.23
 
The use of dividend yield, which I consider the most appropriate method, indicates a valuation of shares in Chong Lee, as at 31 July 1989, of between S$1.61 and S$2.25 per share. The use of the PER, which I consider to be a useful cross-check, indicates a valuation of shares in Chong Lee, as at 31 July 1989, of between S$2.12 and S$2.96 per share.
 
 
 
4.24
 
Both these valuation ranges are reached using a discount of 30 to 50%. If the discounts of 40 to 63% are applied, as indicated by the studies in the United States (referred to at paragraph 3.27), the dividend yield range would be from S$1.19 to S$1.93 and the PER range would be from S$1.56 to S$2.52.
 
 
 
4.25
 
As I have mentioned earlier in this report, valuing shares in an unlisted company is an inexact science requiring much use of judgment. I have already expressed my preference for the use of the dividend yield resulting in a valuation of between S$1.61 and S$2.25. The cross-check from the use of the PER suggests a fair value at the higher end of the dividend yield range.
 
 
 
4.26
 
The E&Y valuation of S$2.15 is at the higher end of my range and so I consider it to be reasonable.
 
 
 
 
By way of over-egging the pudding, the defendants called an expert witness from England. He was John Magill, a member of Deloitte & Touche Board of Partners (UK) since 1954. His opinion was set out in the form of a report. He set out his conclusions in these words: 
 
Conclusion on valuation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The plaintiffs` case 
 
 
 
 
 
That being the case of the defendants, I now turn to the plaintiffs` case. They asserted that the defendants failed, refused or neglected to value the shares with reasonable skill and care. Alternatively, it was asserted that they failed to take care or exercise reasonable professional skill in carrying out their duties. They also relied on the doctrine of res ipso loquitur. If the doctrine applied at all, it meant that the value of $2.15 by itself proved that the defendants were in breach of their duty or negligent. That would in effect be begging the question and would mean that the plaintiffs` subjective assertion sufficed as sufficient proof. In his case it has no justification in law. The plaintiffs had to demystify their case in clear terms.
The plaintiffs then purported to give particulars of their assertions. In some respects, these particulars were as hazy as they could be. They lacked clarity. The particulars they gave were as follows : 
 
 
(a) failing to take all material factors into consideration when valuing the said shares; 
 
(b) failing to adopt the correct method of valuation, alternatively failing to apply the method of valuation correctly; 
 
(c) failing to observe the fact that the company was a going concern and to value the company`s shares properly on that basis; 
 
(d) further and/or alternatively as regards the price earnings basis failing to observe or to consider that by basing their calculations on a straight line average earnings basis that such a method of calculation would fail to result in a fair valuation of the said shares and would fall for short of a maintainable earnings basis necessary for a fair valuation of the said shares; 
 
(e) further or in the alternative, failing to observe or consider that it was inappropriate to base the earnings ratio valuation based on SESDAQ companies whose business are different from that of the company; 
 
(f) failing to observe or to consider that it was inappropriate to base their price earnings ratio valuation based on the average price earnings ratio of listed SESDAQ companies in preference to listed Mainboard companies; 
 
(g) further or in the alternative, failing to observe or to consider the fact that the company was at all material times a private company, alternatively not a company listed on the Stock Exchange and that in all the circumstances, it was inappropriate to base their price earnings ratio valuation based on the average price earnings ratio of already listed SESDAQ or other listed mainboard companies rather than on the price earnings ratios of companies at the flotation stage or pre-listing stage of their shares; 
 
(h) in the circumstances, failing to exercise reasonable care and professional skill in carrying out the valuation and making the report; 
 
(i) further or in the alternative, as regards their valuation on the dividends basis, failing to observe or to consider that in relation to the fact that investment in shares is fundamentally different from investment in fixed deposits and that a higher yield compensates for the absence of any gain on the underlying principal in the latter case whereas in the former, a lower yield is acceptable since it is compensated by a potential appreciation in the underlying principal; and 
 
(j) failing in all circumstances to apply a benchmark return rate which was based on yields that could reasonably have been achieved if the investment had been in shares of similar companies and thereby applying a like comparison of yields from a similar type of investment.
  
 
 
The defendants asked the plaintiffs to improve on the particulars but the plaintiffs could not do very much. In response to a request for further particulars, the plaintiffs gave this revealing answer : 
 
The proper method or methods for valuing the said shares would be based on either the earnings basis or dividend yield basis.
 
 
 
This plainly meant that either one of the methods can be used. One is not subordinate to the other.
The above two bases were expanded as follows : 
 
 
(i) Under the earnings basis, the maintainable level of post tax earnings of the company and its subsidiaries will be used. To this earnings, the appropriate factor (known as price earnings ratio) would be applied in arriving at the value of the shares in the company. On the basis of the maintainable post tax earnings of S$3.444m and net price earnings ratio of 10.92, the shares in the company are valued at approximately S$37.61m or S$3.17 per share. 
 
(ii) Under the dividend yield basis, this method involves looking at the dividends the shareholders who are investors in the company can look to receiving on a regular basis as a return on the investments. This basis determines the principal amount this is required to be invested such that the returns to the shareholders remain unchanged had they invested the proceeds from the sale in other types of similar investments. Considering the dividend payments paid by the company from 1987 to 1991, the maintainable level of dividends would be 10% gross per annum. With shares having a nominal value of S$1 per share, the gross dividend yield from investing in the company is therefore 10%. Comparing the gross dividend yield of the initial public offerings (IPOs) during the period from July 1989 to July 1990 which ranged from 1% to 4.1% giving an overall average of about 2.15%. As the company is an unlisted company, a discount factor of 30% would be applied to the average gross yield giving an adjusted gross yield of about 3.07%. Taking the gross market yield of 3.07% and the actual gross yield of 10% for investment in the company, the shares of the company would be valued at S$3.26 per share.
  
 
 
The plaintiffs were asked to state the material factors to be taken into consideration when valuing the shares. The material factors enumerated by them were as follows : 
 
 
(a) With regard to the earnings basis, 
 
(i) the maintainable level of post tax earnings of the company and it subsidiaries 
 
(ii) the audited earnings of the company and its subsidiaries for the financial years 1987 to 1990 
 
(iii) the price earnings ratio applicable to the company 
 
(iv) the price earnings ratio of Main Board companies achieved for their Initial Public Offerings during the period after 31st July 1989 and to 31st July 1990 which ranged from 11.2 to 61.9 
 
(v) notwithstanding the fact that the company is unlisted, the P/E ratios of IPOs in the Main Board provide a reasonable basis for determining the average P/E ratio with an appropriate discount. 
 
(b) With regard to the dividend yield basis, the factors are 
 
(i) the dividend payments of the company for the period 1987 to 1991 
 
(ii) the maintainable levels of dividends of 10% gross per annum 
 
(iii) the gross dividend yield from investing in the company 
 
(iv) the gross dividend yield of the IPOs during the period from July 1989 to July 1990 ranging from 1% to 4% giving an overall average of about 2.15% and adjusted by a discount factor to take into account the fact that the company is not listed.
  
 
 
The particulars set out in the statement of claim were based on a report and affidavit of Ng Boon Yew of KPMG Peat Marwick who was called as an expert witness to assist the plaintiffs. It is unnecessary to quote his report extensively. In his affidavit he said, among other things, `as far as I can determine from the working papers that I have been given it does not appear to me that the defendants have applied either the earnings basis or the dividend yield basis when in my view those would be the appropriate methods of valuation that should have been applied.` This assertion was the pith and substance of the plaintiffs` pleaded case.
The value of $3.17 arrived at by Ng Boon Yew on earnings basis gave $1.02 more than the fair value formed by the defendants, $2.15 that is. This was an increase of 47%. The value of $3.26 on dividend basis gave something more than that - namely $1.11 each share or 52%.
 The law 
 
 
 
My task in this case was to determine whether the plaintiffs` assertions bear the light of law. I shall therefore state the applicable law. It is settled law that the valuation whether it is a speaking or a non-speaking valuation, the valuer has to attain the requisite standard of care of an ordinary competent valuer. He must exercise reasonable care and skill. Hence the valuer can be sued in tort or contract if he fails to reach the standard demanded of him in valuing shares. 33 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 623 states the following propositions of law:
 
 
Proposition 1
 
-
 
A professional is required to meet the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have the special skill in question
 
 
 
Proposition 2
 
-
 
An error of judgment will not amount to negligence unless it is one that would not have been made by a reasonably competent professional with the standard and type of skill of the defendant, acting with ordinary care.
 
 
 
Proposition 3
 
-
 
Where there are differing and well established professional schools of thought on an issue, a professional will not be regarded as negligent in following one rather than another even if the outcome suggests that the wrong choice was made.
 
 
 
 
The following propositions supply gloss to the above :
 
 
Proposition 4
 
-
 
The test is the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have that special skill. A man need not possess the highest expert skill at the risk of being found negligent. It is well established law that it is sufficient if he exercises the ordinary skill of an ordinary competent man exercising that particular art: 
Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee
 
[1957] 1 WLR 582
 at 586 per McNair J.
 
 
 
Proposition 5
 
-
 
Where a plaintiff`s claim is based on an allegation that the fully considered decision of a a professional in the field of his special skill is negligent, it is not sufficient for the plaintiff to show that there is a body of competent opinion which considers that that decision is wrong if there also exists a body of professional opinion, equally competent, which supports the decision as being reasonable in the circumstances. It has to be recognised that differences of opinion and practice exist in any profession and that there is seldom any one answer exclusive of all others to problems of professional judgment and therefore although the court might prefer one body of opinion to the other that is not a basis for a conclusion that there has been negligence on the part of a defendant professional. See 
Maynard v West Midlands Regional Health Authority
 
[1985] 1 All ER 635
.
 
 
 
Proposition 6
 
-
 
Proposition 6 - In carrying out the duty the standard of skill and care reasonably to be expected of a valuer allows for differing views, or even a wrong view, without the valuer holding that view necessarily being held liable for breach of duty. Valuation is not an exact science and pre-eminently involves an exercise of opinion and judgment which by its very nature might be fallible. See 
Luxmoore-May v Messenger May Baverstock
 
[1990] 1 All ER 1067
.
 
 
 
Proposition 7
 
-
 
Valuation is not an exact science; it involves questions of judgment on which experts may differ without forfeiting their claim to professional competence. The fact that a judge may think one approach better than another is therefore irrelevant. , in the sense of being the figure which a judge after hearing the evidence would determine. . [Emphasis added.] See

.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The issue is not whether the expert`s valuation is right 
 
 
 
 It is whether he has acted in accordance with practices which are regarded as acceptable by a respectable body of opinion in his profession 
 
I shall now set out the accepted principles on fair value as seen by the accounting profession. CG Glover, who is considered an authority on valuation of shares, says in 
 Valuation of Unquoted Companies 
 (2nd Ed) p 29 : 
 
The fair value concept is frequently encountered in the share transfer provisions of private companies` articles of association. These often provide that in specified instances shares shall be transferred at the fair value determined by the company`s auditors. Sometimes shareholders enter into side agreements governing the disposal of shares and these, too, may contain pre-emption rights stipulating a fair value to be determined by a nominated expert valuer. The fair values thus determined are generally expressed to be binding on the parties. It is not surprising, therefore, that dissatisfied vendors and purchasers have on occasion resorted to litigation in order to overturn the fair value award. Despite, this, there seems to be very little guidance from the legal cases as to what constitutes fair value, the court`s main concern being to define the rights of the parties and the liability of the independent valuer. In these circumstances the valuer himself must judge what is fair, and provided his judgment is arrived at honestly and not negligently, it should stand.
 
 
 
For the reader who is seeking guidance on this point the author can therefore do no more than give his own personal view, based on experience, as to what constitutes fair value. First, fair value is distinct from market value. Were it not, the articles of association or other legal agreement would stipulate market value as this is the more generally recognised value concept. Second, the essence of the fair value concept is the desire to be equitable to both parties. It recognises that the transaction is not in the open market. Buyer and seller have been brought together by the operation of a legally binding agreement in a way which excludes other potential buyers and sellers. Thus, the buyer has not been able to shop around for the lowest price nor has the seller been able to hold out for the highest price. In these circumstances, the fair value must take into account as a minimum requirement what the seller gives up in value and what the buyer acquires in value through the transaction. The valuer must therefore assess the owner value of the shares to both vendor and purchaser.
 
 
 
At p 34 he adds: 
 
Generalisations are dangerous and particularly so in the art of valuation. 
 There are no rules determining fair value
. The concept imposes considerable demands on the valuer. Not only is he required to exercise his valuation skills, he is also to employ them in a way which ensures justice between buyer and seller. One valuer`s concept of fairness may differ from another. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The short lesson to cull from the above is that the formative process of valuation involves two principal elements : Application of the normatives which is an objective process. Then comes forming an opinion or placing a dollar value which is a subjective process. A court of law entrusted with the tasking of determining whether a professional is negligent or in breach of duty to exercise due skill and care should never be trapped into a nit-picking exercise.
 Discussion 
 
 
 
By their pleaded case, the plaintiffs conceded that the dividend yield method was an accepted and appropriate method to determine the fair value of the plaintiffs` shares - that is, 10.56% of the total shares. The other permitted method was earnings method. It was not their pleaded case that one method was subordinate to the other. The defendants used the permitted dividend yield method. They used two other methods for counter-checking.
At the trial, however, the plaintiffs attempted to shift their position. Their counsel said: `using the dividend basis in this particular exercise is wrong. The P/E basis should be the correct basis.` In view of the concession in the pleading this was an untenable new stand. However, it was not pressed on at the trial. `There is no dispute about the correctness of the criteria. The question is whether the criteria was applied correctly`, said counsel for the plaintiffs. I therefore reject that part of the plaintiffs` case that a wrong method was used. In the result the plaintiffs were confined to contend that the right method was applied wrongly in the sense that accepted routes were not followed as stated in Proposition 7 set out in [para ] 18 above.
Apart from the above, I hold that the earning basis is inappropriate to determine the fair value of the 10.56% minority shares in question. In this regard I accept the evidence of the defendants` witnesses, Ong Yew Huat and John Magill, that the earnings basis is the appropriate method when shares which represent a controlling interest are being valued. This view is confirmed by CG Glover at p 215 : 
 
 
 The earning basis is required for valuing controlling interests
. The reason for this is quite simple. ... The nature of a share changes fundamentally, as far as valuation is concerned, when the shareholding becomes big enough to confer control. Before the point is reached, the doctrine that a shareholder is not a part owner the company`s business undertaking accords with - indeed determines the commercial reality. Such shareholder must be content with what dividends the directors see fit to declare. Once control is obtained, however, the shareholder may distribute all the profits by way of dividend, should he so wish.
 
 
 
The defendants were not valuing a controlling interest.
I shall note here that the plaintiffs in their submissions stated that the dividend flow basis used by the defendants `is generally used to value small parcel of shares that did not give control to the purchaser`. In support they cited 
Holt v Inland Revenue Commissioners
 
[1953] 2 All ER 1499
. There is however no law which says that this method cannot be used for ascertaining fair market value before placing a fair value. In this case the block of shares that was being sold was a small minority parcel and the indication at the relevant time was that all the other shareholders taken together were the buyers. They already had a huge majority holding of 89.44%.
The plaintiffs at the trial attempted to advance another unpleaded case - that the valuation done by the defendants was an open market value. This, they said, was discernible from the working papers. I could find no such evidence. On the other hand all the evidence adduced before me affirmed that that the dividend yield method was used to determine the fair value. All the evidence adduced before me showed clearly that the valuer appreciated the fact that he was placing a `fair value` of a 10.56% minority interest and not the shares of the company in the abstract. Furthermore, the evidence clearly established clearly that the valuer proceeded on the basis that the company was a going concern. He, of course, had to determine the value of the shares first and then proceed to determine the fair value.
In the cross-examination, counsel for the plaintiffs, put to Ong that what he did was a desk top valuation. This was denied flatly by Ong and rightly so. There was abundant evidence to show that the correct method was used as conceded by the plaintiffs.
This brings me to the plaintiffs` point that the method was applied wrongly. The high-water mark of their case on this point was the evidence of their expert - Ng Boon Yew. He did his valuation in his own way and arrived at the value of S$3.26. It was somewhat bizarre that the plaintiffs placed great importance on Ng Boon Yew`s valuation because they rightly said in their submission that `the valuation that is to be determined by the court is not that done by KPMG Peat Marwick (plaintiffs` experts) or Mr Magill, (the defendants` expert witness) but the valuation done by the defendants`. To sustain their case the plaintiffs had to show that the defendants did something which no competent valuer or specialist valuer would have done. The plaintiffs did not even attempt to do this. Instead they attempted to dogmatize Ng Lye Huat`s route as the correct route as though he had the last word on it. The defendants` valuation was supported by authorities and their expert witness who proved to be more competent and knowledgeable than the plaintiffs` expert witness. Ng Boon Yew lacked the qualities of credibility and competence. Their case in effect was that the valuation by KPMG Peat Marwick was the right valuation. This approach was against Proposition 7 stated above and I was compelled to reject it.
I hold that the plaintiffs` approach was erroneous and unsupported by the law. It was conceded that the correct method or formula was used by the defendants. Then there was the question of applying the formula by introducing variables and estimates. The plaintiffs` expert and the defendants used different variables. As to one factor, namely, selection of an appropriate rate of return, the defendants used the risk free rates of return. This was advocated by CG Glover. Next there was the discount factor. The plaintiffs applied a flat 30% whereas common practice allowed a range going up to 50%. Inevitably, therefore, the three valuers came up with three different valuations. This established that the formative process of valuation involving, several variables, alternatives and estimates would never result in a single common fair value. This conclusion equally applied to the dividend basis as well as the earnings basis.
 Flaws in plaintiffs` case 
 
 
 
I shall now set out some egregious flaws in the plaintiffs` case. These were all due to their expert witness, Ng Boon Yew. 
(i) In extracting the numbers in connection with the calculation of the dividend basis Ng Boon Yew made an extraction error. The error resulted in a loss of 44 cents per share to his clients, the plaintiffs ($3.26 - $2.82). In absolute terms this was $552,126.52 which is some 40% of the plaintiffs` claim based on the dividend basis. This was not an attractive proposition for the plaintiffs to adhere to. 
(ii) Ng Boon Yew`s initial position was that both the earning basis and the dividend basis were equally applicable to his valuation and that the defendants had not used either. Later he shifted his ground and said that the earnings basis should be the primary basis. The accepted opinion in the profession was radically different. It was succinctly and accurately stated by the defendants` expert witness as follows: `Minority should be valued on a dividends basis; majority on a price earnings basis. So for a start, usually in a private company, valuation on a dividend basis because the minority only gets dividends; can`t get hold of earnings. ... It cannot be right to use P/E basis to value a minority holding at fair value. What I do agree is that in my mind, I would look at the fair market value of 10% holding in an unlisted company like this at the lower end and possibly even the lowest end of my range of $1.61 to $2.25. The reason why I think that $2.15 of Ernst & Young is reasonable is because it has been pulled up to take into account the buyer.` This made very good sense and I accepted it without reservation. Quite shockingly Ng Boon Yew had not appreciated this elementary principle. 
(iii) It was not difficult to perceive a hidden agenda for Ng Boon Yew`s line of thought. He had been engaged by the plaintiffs and he knew that his report would be used to launch an attack on the defendants. Unlike the defendants who had to balance the interests of both parties Ng Boon Yew owed a duty to only one party. After the discovery of the extraction error, the dividend basis of the claim was reduced from $3.26 to $2.82. That was 44 cents each share or $555,126 in total. This meant that, if the court accepts the dividend basis the increase would be 67 cents per share ($2.82 - $2.15 [equals] 67 cents) or an increase by 31%. This was not an attractive proposition. Hence the shift in stand to make the earnings basis the primary basis. 
(iv) In Ng Boon Yew`s view the sale of the 10.56% shares was a sale from a one minority group to another minority interest with the result that the latter would be converted into a majority interest. At the time the valuation was undertaken there was no indication as to who would buy how many. On the other hand the indication was that all the remaining interests, that is the 89.44% shareholders, would be the buyers. To quote John Magill again, `All the authorities refer to valuing minorities and majorities on a different basis. I cannot see how a 2% shareholding with no influence can be valued on the same basis as one might a 95% shareholding. The discounts may be different. You do fair market values and then try to reach fair value from that. But I believe you would have much more weight on the dividend basis because these are minority shareholders and all they get is dividends`. This was the main point which made me infer that Ng Boon Yew took a partisan position in favour of his clients. It is possible he might have taken that position unconsciously. 
(v) Then there was the discount factor. John Magill said in evidence : `Then you have discounts because these shares aren`t marketable and in my opinion, I would probably give a larger discount for the minority than I would give for the majority`. The witness added that in the UK there was a range of 30% to 50%. That there was a range to choose from is well established. Ng Boon Yew was aware of this and in fact in one case he had applied 50%. For the purpose of this case he applied a flat 30%. He became dogmatic in this case and applied the lower level of the range. This was yet another instance of a partisan propensity in a matter where one is considering fair value which involves balancing the interests of both parties.
On the whole the plaintiffs` case was long on pedantic fault-finding but short on essential points. This was due to their reliance on Ng Boon Yew who failed to act in accordance with established principles and practice.
I therefore concluded that when all the evidence and the principles of law and the methods of valuation were considered, the plaintiffs` case proved to be thinner than the spider`s line. They failed to prove negligence or breach of duty on the part of the defendants because they could not establish errors of principle on the part of the defendants. The weight of evidence adduced by the defendants showed that they acted within accepted principles and parameters. Accordingly, their claim was dismissed.

Factories Act (Cap 104, 1998 Rev Ed)
 
: This is an action for damages for losses suffered on account of a fire which broke out on 15 October 1997 at about 5.14pm at an industrial building (single storeyed) known as No 68 Sungai Kadut Street 1 (`No 68`). The two plaintiffs (hereinafter called `Virco` and `GJ`) were the tenants of two units in the building. The first defendant was the owner/landlord of the building and the second and third defendants were two other tenants in the same building. I shall hereinafter refer to the three defendants as `Carltech`, `Kee` and `Ah Cheong` respectively.
 Background 
 
 
 
The land on which No 68 stood was leased by Carltech from the Jurong Town Corporation in 1989. The building was of a rectangular shape, somewhat longish. It was a large building. Carltech sub-divided the building into some 70 different units and subletted them to various entities. Earlier, in 1990, a fire occurred at one end of the building and destroyed that part of it. After that fire, Carltech reconstructed that part and also added a mezzanine floor to that portion.
The two plaintiffs occupied two units on the ground floor. GJ`s unit was directly below the mezzanine floor but Virco`s unit was not. It was adjacent and separated by one other unit. Kee occupied one part of the mezzanine floor and Ah Cheong the other.
Kee was carrying on a business of manufacturing and supplying plastic or fibreglass vehicle bumpers and moulds and of doing coating and spray painting works. Kee would store fibreglass or plastic bumpers, moulds, paints and resins at his premises. Ah Cheong was carrying on a business of supplying disposable polyethylene bags, plastics and receptables, paper food wrappers, plastic cutlery, straws, chopsticks and papers and had utilized the unit for the storage of the same.
The earlier 1990 fire was suspected to have been caused by arson. Fortunately for Carltech, its losses from that fire was covered by insurance. Carltech was as a result advised by the insurers to take certain fire preventive/detection measures, eg to install smoke detectors, to clear wood waste from the premises and to advise sub-tenants against storing hazardous items such as benzene or kerosene of more than four gallons.
In 1993 Carltech changed its insurers. Apparently, the new insurers were less stringent in terms of fire-safety requirements. Carltech claimed that it had in 1991 installed two new fire hose-reels on the mezzanine floor. But no one has testified that he/she saw any hose-reel on that floor.
Carltech was aware of the activities carried out by Kee and Ah Cheong and of the things that were stored in their respective units. So were the two plaintiffs. Carltech was also aware of the business activities of Virco and GJ, and in a general sort of a way, so were Kee and Ah Cheong.
On 15 October 1997, at about 5.14pm, the two employees of Kee had finished their work for the day and were preparing to return home. One of them (Dawood) went to the toilet, located at another part of the building, and the other (Aziz) was changing clothes within the premises. Then suddenly when Aziz turned his head round he noticed a small fire near the entrance to the premises. He shouted that there was a fire. A commotion followed. Dawood heard the commotion and dashed back to his unit. Both of them tried to put out the fire but failed. There was no fire-fighting equipment within the premises. Others sought to use the two fire hose-reels situated nearby on the ground floor, just below the mezzanine floor. However, the hose-reels could not function as each of the controlling tap-head was placed in a metal casing which was locked. It took a while for someone to get the keys from Carltech`s office nearby to unlock each casing in order to turn on the water supply. Alas, when the tap heads were turned on, only a trickle of water came out of the hose-reels, due to inadequate water supply or pressure or both. There was no other fire-fighting equipment which could be used to put out the fire. As a result, within about ten minutes, the fire engulfed Kee`s unit and spread to the neighbouring premises of Ah Cheong. The heat of the fire was so intense that it caused part of the steel beams supporting the roof, above Kee`s unit, to collapse. By the time the fire brigade arrived and put out the fire, the machines, equipment and materials which were in the premises of Virco and GJ were damaged, caused by heat convection.
 Cause of the out-break of fire 
 
 
 
It is not in dispute that the origin of the fire occurred at the premises occupied by Kee. However, the employee of Kee, Aziz, who was there, did not see how the fire was ignited. His back was against it. The only evidence before me which touches on this critical question on the source of the fire is that of Capt Lee Fook Seng (PW2), who is from the Singapore Civil Defence Force. He testified as an expert. There is no contrary evidence to that of Capt Lee.
In his report, Capt Lee determined that the fire originated near the entrance to the premises of Kee, where a double-point power switch was located (shown in photo No 14 on 1PB196). Placed near to the switch was a workbench which was used for spray-painting. Having examined the burnt patterns and the severe damage to that power switch fitting, he was of the opinion that a spark or sparks generated by the power switch could have ignited the paint residue which had accumulated at the location for several years. I should explain that Kee had only occupied the premises for about a year before the occurrence of the fire. Before him, the previous tenant had also been using the premises for carrying on the same kind of business.
So the question is whether can blame be placed upon either Carltech or Kee or both. Carltech says that the power switch was installed by the previous tenant. Accepting that, upon the termination of the previous tenancy, any installation done by the previous tenant, unless required to be removed by Carltech, would become a fixture of Carltech. There is no evidence that Kee knew the power switch was installed by the previous tenant and not by Carltech. The terms of the tenancy agreements which Carltech entered into with the various tenants of the building were similar. Clause 2(e) provided that the tenant was required to `keep ... the landlord`s fixture therein, including ... electric wiring and installations and fittings for light and power in clean condition and to replace or repair any part of ... the landlord`s fixture and fitting therein which shall be broken or damaged due to malicious negligence or careless acts or omissions of the tenant.` There was no breach by Kee of this provision when he continued to use the power switch. Kee had not done anything to cause the switch to be defective or damaged. It was undoubtedly an inherently defective switch. If no spark had escaped from the switch socket there would probably not have been any fire. A good switch, or a properly installed switch, would have contained the sparks, if any, within the socket itself.
Accordingly, I find there was a breach of duty on the part of Carltech in providing a defective power switch. However, in my view, there was also a breach of duty on the part of Kee in not appreciating the danger posed by the accumulation of paint-residue. The spark(s) would not have ignited but for the accumulated paint residue.
Even if I had imposed too high a standard of care on the part of Carltech and Kee in the preceding two paragraphs, the state of affairs which existed, to which both of them had contributed, constituted a nuisance, as actual knowledge is not an essential ingredient for this tort.
 Cause for spread of fire 
 
 
 
On the evidence there is no doubt that there was no adequate fire-fighting equipment either within the premises of Kee or within reasonable proximity of that premises. Having regard to the nature of the business that was being carried out by Kee, and the materials which he stored there (though not highly inflammable), he ought to have provided at least a portable fire extinguisher within the premises for his own use if the need should arise. If there were such a fire extinguisher that day which his employees could have used to combat the fire, it could well have made a difference. To this extent, Kee was in breach of his duty of care.
As mentioned before, there were two fire hose-reels on the ground level, just outside the building wall, which were within close proximity to Kee`s premises. Apart from the delay due to the locking of each of the tap head in a metal casing, both the hose-reels turned out to be entirely ineffective as there was hardly any water from the hoses to fight the fire even after the taps had been turned on. In my view, Carltech was at fault in locking up the tap heads in metal casings. The whole point of having a fire fighting equipment is that it should be readily accessible for use when the need arises. I have no doubt that had the two fire hose-reels, particularly the one on the ground floor by the side of the staircase leading directly to Kee`s premises, been in operational condition and no time had been lost to look for the keys to open the metal casings and turn on the taps, the fire which broke out in Kee`s premises would have been contained and put out. It would not have spread.
In cross examination, Carltech`s director, Tan Chin Bee, said that the fire hose-reels were checked in May 1997. In para 7 of the statement of claim the plaintiffs specifically raised the question of the inadequate supply of water or water pressure. Yet, no record was produced by Carltech of any alleged checking done on the fire hose-reels in May 1997 by the Civil Defence Force. Nor were the latter called by Carltech to testify. The only conclusion I can come to is that no checking was done at all. As for the locking of the tap head in the casing, Tan Chin Bee said it was not locked, only secured by a wire to prevent knocking into by forklifts. I do not see the need for the wire if the tap was already inside the metal casing. I accept the evidence for the plaintiffs that the casing was locked.
The condition of the two fire hose-reels clearly shows that they had not been serviced or maintained for sometime. To have a hose-reel that does not function is worse than not providing any hose-reel at all as it gives the tenants a false impression that the fire-fighting equipment provided is adequate for the tenants` use. I find that, in this regard, Carltech has failed in its duty of care in two respects: 
(i) failing to have the hose-reels and the water-supply to the hose-reels regularly checked and tested to ensure that they were operationally effective to fight any fire that might occur; 
(ii) causing delay in the effort to combat the fire by locking each tap head in a metal casing. Whatever may be the reasons why Carltech did that (eg to prevent pilfering or wasting of water), I do not think those reasons could justify rendering the hose-reels inaccessible when the occasion requires it. Other steps should have been adopted which could prevent the mischief without hindering the use of a hose-reel whenever the need arises. Purely as an example, and nothing more, the key could have been placed in a glass panel which upon being broken would also trigger an alarm.
I must, however, hasten to add that in the circumstances of this case, even if each tap head had not been locked in the metal casing, the two hose-reels would not have been of any use either, as the water pressure was low. As I have said before, I have no doubt that had the fire hose-reels been in order, they would have prevented the fire from spreading within the premises of Kee and onto the premises of Ah Cheong. From a small flame which could have been controlled and extinguished, the fire developed into a raging flame, spreading onto the premises of Ah Cheong.
 Unlicenced factory 
 
 
 
One of the points raised by the defendants is that the plaintiffs were using their premises as factories without a licence from the Chief Inspector of Factories of the Ministry of Manpower. Virco`s response is that it was in the process of obtaining such a licence.
It seems to me clear that Virco was operating a factory at the premises without first obtaining a factory licence. But, in my view, nothing in that breach of Virco can give Carltech a cause of action or a defence. In 
 Clerk & Lindsell on Torts 
, the learned authors (17th Ed) state in para 11-01 that: 
 
It is now beyond doubt that such liability will arise only when the plaintiff can establish that Parliament intended breach of the relevant statutory duty to be actionable by an individual harmed by that breach.
 
 
 
In 
Nimmo v Alexander Cowan & Sons Ltd
 
[1968] AC 107
 Lord Upjohn stated that (at p 125): 
 
... it is not in doubt that the whole object of the Factories Act is to reinforce the common law obligation of the employer to take care for the safety of his workmen ...
 
 
 
This statement of Lord Upjohn was fully endorsed by our Court of Appeal in 
Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co Ltd
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 677
 .
The Factories Act is for the protection of workmen. The loss which is the subject of the present action has nothing to do with the object of the Factories Act. It is really no different from that of a situation where Virco had merely used the premises to store the machines. It cannot be contended that in that situation the loss cannot be recovered from the defendants. It is pertinent to note that the notice from the Chief Inspector of Factories merely asked Virco to stop operating as a factory. It might perhaps be different if there is a claim for personal injury by an employee working at the `factory`. Accordingly, I hold that there is no merit in this contention.
 Question of the liability of the third defendant 
 
 
 
It is clear that the fire did not start at the premises of Ah Cheong. It spread over from Kee`s premises. The basis upon which the plaintiffs seek to pin liability on Ah Cheong is that the contents of Ah Cheong`s premises had aggravated and increased the combustion, enhanced the heat and spread the fire.
It cannot be denied that the materials stored in the premises of Ah Cheong were combustible. While the heat from the fire from the premises of Kee, and perhaps also of Ah Cheong, was so intense that it caused the steel beams which supported that portion of the roof structure above Kee`s premises to weaken and collapse, that cannot by itself impose liability on Ah Cheong. The building was a warehouse. There was no evidence to suggest that those things were hazardous or highly inflammable, though they could be burnt. I do not think the mere fact that the goods stored by Ah Cheong in the premises were combustible was sufficient by itself to imply negligence or that she had created a dangerous condition. Under the terms of the tenancy agreement, what Ah Cheong was not allowed to do was to store goods which were `specially combustible, flammable or dangerous.` There is no evidence that the goods stored by Ah Cheong were of that nature. This same term was also in the Tenancy Agreements of the two plaintiffs.
According to Capt Lee what he observed was that there was surface burning of the contents of the materials stored in the premises of Ah Cheong. At the time of the fire, the proprietor of Ah Cheong had locked up the premises and left for the day. Ah Cheong, however, did keep a fire-extinguisher within the premises. Having regard to all the foregoing, I do not think Ah Cheong was in any way in breach of the duty of care. The plaintiffs` action against the third defendant is, therefore, dismissed.
 Apportionment of liability 
 
 
 
Liability for the fire lies with Carltech and Kee. On the aspect as to the cause of the fire, the blame lies with both of them - on Carltech, in failing to provide a safe power switch and on Kee, in failing to appreciate the danger caused by the accumulation of paint residue. Kee knew that the previous tenant was carrying on a similar business there and Kee continued with that business. In the alternative, they are both liable in nuisance.
Of greater significance was the absence of a good and effective fire fighting equipment. The flame which was ignited would have been put out if the fire hose-reels were in operational condition. This was the real cause of the damage suffered by the plaintiffs. I have also mentioned that Kee should have provided for some form of a fire extinguisher. I cannot say for certain whether a portable fire fighting equipment could have extinguished the fire and prevented it from spreading. Aziz said that the fire could have been extinguished but he had nothing to extinguish it with. But a tenant is entitled to assume that the fire-fighting equipment provided by the landlord would be maintained and be in good operational condition. As an illustration of Carltech`s neglect for fire safety, I ought to mention that it installed a smoke detector system in 1991 for the building as required by the previous insurer. It was last serviced in 1993. On the day of the fire no alarm sounded.
Having carefully weighed the causes and the blameworthiness of the parties and bearing in mind, in particular, the experience gained by Carltech out of the 1990 fire, my conclusion on how liability should be apportioned is as follows:
 
 
 
Carltech
 
Kee
 
 
 
Initial cause of fire
 
10%

(20%)
 
 
 
 
 
Spread of fire
 
70%
 
70%
 
 
 
(80%)
 
 
 
 
 
 
80%
 
20%
 
 
 
 
I have placed a much greater share of the responsibility for the spread of the fire on Carltech because Carltech should have known better of the need to have a good and effective fire prevention and fire-fighting system, and yet did very little, if at all, about it. The intolerable state of the fire hose-reels speaks volumes. What we see is absolute neglect.
 Exemption under cl 4(c) 
 
 
 
In its closing written submission, Carltech seeks to avoid liability by relying on cl 4(c) of the tenancy agreement which reads as follows: 
 
The landlord shall not be in any way responsible for any loss, damage of any stock or other property of the lessee left or stored in the premises except where such loss or damage has been wilfully caused by personnel directly or indirectly employed by the landlord.
 
 
 
I must first observe that this is not a defence raised in the pleadings. That should suffice to dispose of the point. In any case, I do not think this provision is available to Carltech. In the light of my views above on the state of the fire hose-reels, I find that there was reckless disregard for safety when Carltech failed to maintain them. Having experienced a fire in 1990, the risk of an out-break of fire again was certainly an event within the contemplation of Carltech. Its conduct in failing to maintain the fire hose-reels amounted to recklessness or wilfulness.
 Damages: First plaintiff`s losses 
 
 
 
Virco was engaged in the business of stamping and shaping metal sheets and the assembling of metal products. At all material times there were power press machines and other equipment and tools in the premises. In the course of its business Virco had also received moulds (called `toolings`) and metal and plastic components from its customers to be processed into finished or semi-finished products. Two such customers were Hunter Manufacturing Pte Ltd and Sin Ma Tai Engineering Pte Ltd.
Virco claims for three main heads of losses: (i) $127,082 for the damage to its machineries, equipment, fixtures and furnishings, (ii) $98,728 for the damage to the materials and/or components of its customers, Hunter Manufacturing and Sin Ma Tai Engineering, and (iii) $125,397 being loss of income from 15 October 1997 up to December 1998, such loss having arisen from the disruption to its business caused by the fire.
I must observe that under the amount of $127,082 what Virco is claiming is based upon the original purchase prices it paid for the machines, etc, without making any deduction whatsoever for depreciation. With respect, it is absurd for Virco (and to be seen later, GJ too) to claim based on the original prices. Four of those items are not even pleaded in the statement of claim. Before me, Virco had also abandoned their claim for $8,853 for fixtures and furnishings. The values of those five items come up to $20,011. In its closing written submission, Virco asked for leave to amend the statement of claim so as to include the four omitted items. I do not think it would be fair to the defendants for me to grant leave in this manner and at this late stage. As regards depreciation I note that the machines or articles had generally been in use for between two and four years. If I were to award damages based on those figures, there would be over compensation. However, there is no independent assessment of what the values of those machines or articles were as of the date of the fire. I see that in Virco`s audited statement of accounts it had depreciated machines, etc over a three-year period. Virco explained that that was for tax purposes. But there is no other evidence before me as to the correct formula for depreciation. If Virco says that the machines are worth more than the values as reflected in the accounts, it should adduce evidence to that effect. That, it has failed to do. Of the remaining items which have a total value of $107,071, the most expensive item there is a power press machine which was purchased less than two years before the fire at $67,500. Bearing this in mind and the fact that in the accounts, machines were depreciated over a three-year period, and taking all the machines as a whole, I think a deduction of 60% for depreciation would be fair, giving a net value of $42,828.
The next head of claim relates to those tooling moulds/materials which were left with Virco by its customers, Hunter Manufacturing and Sin Ma Tai, and for which Virco was allegedly responsible. Hunter Manufacturing`s claim amounted to $97,889 and Sin Mai Tai`s only $839 (as amended before me), making a total of $98,728. Other than the bills submitted by these two customers to Virco (1PB57-60), the customers were not called upon by Virco to substantiate their claims in court. Neither is there evidence of any independent adjuster or surveyor. Both Hunter Manufacturing and Sin Ma Tai have not taken action against Virco. The defendants have challenged the extent to which such tooling moulds and materials had been damaged. Initially, I was inclined to adopting a broad brush and reduce the sum claimed by a certain percentage. Although I can see from the photographs that some of the things were damaged, there is no basis for me to adopt any figure as the appropriate deduction, as there is simply no evidence to enable me to do that. The problem is one of proof, not one of absence of loss. In the circumstances, I would only make a nominal award and would fix it at $3,000.
The last head of claim relates to loss of profit for the period up to December 1998 which Virco has quantified at $125,397.00, made up of $75,397 for 1997 and $50,000 for 1998. The evidence which Virco has submitted to substantiate this claim is unsatisfactory. What is submitted to me is a hand-written statement (exh P2) purportedly to be the estimated losses for 1997 and 1998. I am skeptical as to the weight I can reasonably give to such a statement. Let me briefly amplify.
The 1996 annual report of Virco, exhibited at 1PB63-93, shows that for that year Virco suffered a loss of $83,617. The accumulated loss carried forward from 1995 was $107,075. Bad debts of $38,572 were written off and $56,342 was provided for depreciation, $25,550 for fines, and $13,337 for directors` fee. Even restoring the $25,000 and $13,337 into the accounts, Virco would still suffer a loss for 1996.
The 1995 audited accounts show a loss of $54,127. For that year it paid directors` fees of $6,750 and director`s remuneration of $45,600 and provided for depreciation of $56,342. Similarly, if one were to plough back the two sums, $6,750 and $45,600, into the company, Virco would still have made a loss.
As for 1997 (when Virco`s business operated only up to 15 October 1997, the date of the fire) the audited accounts show a loss of $74,608. Virco declared directors` fees of $23,011. The accounts stated that the assets written off due to the fire were of a value of $41,968. Even if these two sums of $23,011 and $41,968 were restored into the accounts, 1997 would still have ended in the negative territory. A very significant feature of the business for 1997 is that for a period of more than nine months before the fire, the sales done were only to the tune of $98,524, whereas for the full year of 1996 the sales were $252,833. So it can be seen that for 1997, there was a drastic drop in business.
The amount of profit which Virco estimated it lost in 1998 is $50,000. How this figure is arrived at is set out in exh P2. It is a pure conjecture. While I do recognize that for 1998, if there had not been any fire, and the company was still operating, and, following from the provisions for depreciation for 1995, 1996 and 1997, there would have been no deduction for depreciation for 1998, it still would not follow that 1998 would have been profitable for Virco. In this regard, I have borne in mind that in 1997 Virco`s business had slowed down, and in 1998, Singapore, and this region, were going through a financial and economic crisis.
In any event, what better proof can there be than this to show that Virco was not profitable: it had decided to cease business. It would probably have obtained alternative premises to carry on the business if it were profitable.
Accordingly, I hold that Virco has not proven that it has suffered a loss of $75,397 for 1997 and $50,000 for 1998. Thus, the losses of Virco which I hold have been proven to my satisfaction are the following:
 
 
(i)
 
damage of machinery and equipment
 
:
 
$
 
 
42,828
 
 
 
(ii)
 
toolings and materials of customers (nominal damages)

 Second plaintiff`s losses 
 
 
 
 
 
GJ was in the business of cutting and shaping metal and plastic materials and assembling them into semi-finished products. It had machines at the premises and some other equipment and tools. Like Virco, it also received and stored raw materials and/or goods of customers for processing. A main customer of GJ was Chartered Ammunition Industries Pte Ltd. GJ claims for the following heads of losses: 
(i) $40,507, being the damage caused to GJ`s machinery, equipment, fixtures and materials; 
(ii) $10,977.20, being the value of the materials and finished products of Chartered Ammunition damaged by the fire for which GJ is liable to indemnify; 
(iii) $111,794.46, being the loss of income for the period 15 October 1997 to May 1998; 
(iv) $1,000 being the expenses incurred for relocation.
In addition GJ also claims for a refund of the tenancy deposit of $2,700.
Under the first head there are two components. First is for a sum of $16,920, being the loss of its fixtures and furnishings. From the invoices produced, except for a fan which was purchased in May 1997 for $120, the other items were all bought in June 1996, more than a year before the fire. Deduction must be made for depreciation. There is no evidence before me as to their current value or the correct rate of depreciation. Adopting the same yardstick as I have adopted for the claims of Virco, and approaching this item broadly, I would reduce it by Ã‰ for depreciation. Thus, the sum claimed should be reduced to $11,280/-.
The second component is for $23,587, being the cost of five machines/equipment damaged by the fire. The most expensive machine under this head was a milling machine bought in August 1996 for $15,000. A more recent acquisition on 3 July 1997 was a projector for $6,500. Again, taking the same three-year period for depreciation, I would depreciate this head of claim by Ã‰, making it $15,725.
As for the claim for $10,977.20, being damage to the materials and finished products of GJ`s client, Chartered Ammunition Industries, that again suffers from the same inadequacy in terms of proof as Virco`s claim. I would only grant nominal damage of $1,000.
As for the claim for loss of income, 2PB194 shows that from June to December 1998, the partnership earned, including partners` wages and profits, a total of $47,648. Therefore, the average monthly earning of GJ from June to December 1996 was $6,800 per month ($47,648 divided by 7).
GJ asserts that from January 1997 to 15 October 1997 its net profit was about $168,653, averaging $17,752 per month. These figures are taken out of 2PB199 to 205 and are at variance with those shown on 2PB197, where the following are set out:

I would further add that the accounts which are produced at 2PB194-222 are (with the exception of 2PB194/5) all unsigned. The witness for GJ, Lim Eng Koon (PW4), could not be certain if all these documents were submitted to the tax authorities.
More importantly, there is evidence of the tax return which was submitted to the tax authorities in respect of GJ`s earnings for 1997. The 1998 assessment for GJ (exh P10) shows that the firm earned a total of $63,917 in 1997. Taking $63,917 as being the earnings for nine months, it roughly works out to be $6,700 per month. I would, in passing, observe that the evidence of Lim Eng Koon on the question of loss of income leaves much to be desired. He was saying the firm reported less to the tax authorities. He must live with it.
By November 1997, GJ had acquired alternative premises to continue its business. Lim Eng Koon for GJ said that its income from January 1998 to November 1998 dropped significantly due mainly to the fact that it could only replace one of the two main machines due to lack of funds. But he recognized that Singapore was hit by recession from early 1998. Again, taking a broad view and bearing in mind that losses due to a party`s impecuniosity are too remote (see Liesbosch Dredger v Edison 
[1933] AC 449
), I would award only a sum of $30,150 as loss of income. In computing this figure I have adopted a monthly loss of $6,700 as the basic figure and applied a multiplier of 4Ã§. In other words, I reckon that the losses suffered by GJ until February 1998 could reasonably be attributable to the fire. A period of three months, after acquiring the new premises should be adequate for GJ to obtain replacement machines (if not for GJ`s own impecuniosity).
In the course of the trial the parties have, by their counsel, agreed that for GJ`s loss of a host of other equipment (including tooling moulds), that would be quantified at $5,000.
Thus, the total claim of GJ which I would allow is as follows:
 
 
(i)
 
Fixtures and furnishings
 
$
 
11,280
 
 
 
(ii)
 
Machines

 Miscellaneous points 
 
 
 
 
 
In the pleadings the plaintiffs have raised a number of other contentions to substantiate their claims, eg absence of a sprinkler system, absence of warning or `no-smoking` signs. But in the light of my findings as to the cause of the fire and on why it spread, these points have become wholly irrelevant.
The defendants have also alleged that the plaintiffs were negligent because they had installed unauthorized electrical fittings, appliances and machines at their premises, failed to engage licenced electricians to do the same, and generally failed to have regard to fire safety. Again, these allegations have become, in the light of the cause of the fire as I have found, wholly irrelevant. Some of these allegations were, in any case, withdrawn by Carltech at the trial.
 Judgment 
 
 
 
Accordingly, there shall be judgment for the first and second plaintiffs in the sums of $45,028 and $66,855 respectively, and these sums shall bear interest at 6% from the date of the writ. The first and second defendants shall bear the same in the ratio of 80:20 respectively. The costs of the plaintiffs shall also be borne by the first and second defendants in the same ratio.
The plaintiffs` claim against the third defendant is dismissed with costs which shall be borne equally by the first and second plaintiffs. I do not think this is a case where I ought to make a `Bullock` or `Sanderson` order. The facts do not warrant the bringing in of Ah Cheong as a party, and, especially, for continuing with the action against Ah Cheong after the plaintiffs were in possession of the report of Capt Lee. Neither Carltech nor Kee sought in their pleadings to shift any part of the liability for the damages suffered by Virco and GJ onto Ah Cheong.
 Counterclaim of the first defendant 
 
 
 
Carltech has counterclaimed against Virco for failing to pay rent for its premises for the period 15 September 1997 to 14 October 1997. The sum stated was $8,862,92. In his evidence in cross-examination, Carltech`s witness Tan Chin Bee admitted that the rent was only $3,500 per month and that Virco was holding a deposit of $6,300. It would appear from 1PB102 (a note which this witness gave to Virco) that there was some sort of a running account being maintained by Carltech showing what was owed by Virco in terms of rental and utility and the payments made from time to time by Virco. That document shows that the amount owed by Virco as of the date of the fire was $8,862 and after offsetting the deposit against that sum, there is a balance of $2,562.92. I would give judgment to Carltech on its counterclaim in the sum of $2,562.92, which shall bear interest at 6% from the date of the counterclaim.
Virco contended that the counterclaim is not pleaded in the defence as a balance due on a running account. But it can be seen from 1PB102 that the balance sum of $2,562.92 was by and large outstanding rental. Virco could not have failed to appreciate what was set out in 1PB102. As the point is wholly technical, I think the ends of justice would be better served by allowing the counterclaim on the balanced amount with no costs rather than the alternative approach of granting leave to Carltech to commence a fresh action to claim the balance due.

: The appellant was tried and convicted in the court below of the following amended charge under s 26(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (`the PCA`): 
 
You, Foo Siang Wah Frederick, M/41 yrs, are charged that you, on 15 October 1998 between 3pm and 4pm, at the Tanglin Police Station located at No 17 Napier Road, Singapore, did knowingly hinder the investigations by officers of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau into criminal allegations against one Teo Eng Teck, to wit, by alerting Teo Eng Teck of an investigation against him by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and suggesting that he destroy incriminating evidence so as to frustrate the investigations, and that you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 26(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
He was sentenced to six weeks` imprisonment. The appellant appealed against both his conviction and the sentenced imposed. At the end of the hearing, I dismissed the appeal against conviction but allowed the appeal against sentence. I now give my reasons.
 The background facts 
 
 
 
The appellant was an Inspector of Police at the Tanglin Police Division. He served as the officer-in-charge of the violent crime squad. The squad was made up of seven investigators. The appellant was the Senior Investigation Officer in the squad.
On 15 October 1998, Inspector Elangovan (`PW2`), the designated Chief Investigation Officer (`CIO(IV)`) of the Tanglin Police Division was on leave. The appellant was tasked with covering his duties pursuant to the normal course of things. The CIO(IV) has an estimated 20 to 25 officers under him, which officers come from the general investigation team, and the shoplifting squad.
One Teo Eng Teck (PW7) (`David Teo`) was at that time a sergeant with the Tanglin Police Division. He was attached to the shoplifting squad.
Earlier on, in April 1998, one Josephine Yap Kah Peng (PW4) (`Jo`) and one Angie Ang Kok Ping (`Angie`) were arrested for shoplifting items totalling more than $400. The investigation officer assigned to investigate their case was David Teo.
In May 1998, David Teo began soliciting for sex from Jo and Angie, in return for promises to get them off completely or alternatively for letting them off with a warning in respect of their shoplifting cases. He also fraternised with them.
Between 3 and 4pm on 15 October 1998, Jo and Angie went to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (`CPIB`) to lodge a complaint against David Teo. They were accompanied by one Mohamad Shairi (PW5) (`Shairi`) and two others.
While at the CPIB, Jo received a page from David Teo at or around 6.45pm. She returned the page and allowed the CPIB officers to tape the ensuing conversation, the transcript of which was admitted into evidence. David Teo revealed during the course of the conversation that he was under investigation by the CPIB. He said that he had received the news at around 4pm that same day from one of his CIOs, who had further asked him to rush back home and `
 clear all the stuff in [his] house, [including] whatever police thing 
` that he had brought home. It was further recorded in the transcript that David Teo had heard from his CIO that `they` were going to raid his house. When Jo asked if he had already gone home, David Teo replied that he had `
 done all the thing, burn all the thing `ready 
`.
At around 7.30pm on the same day, Senior Special Investigator Wong Pong Yen (PW3) (`SSI Wong`) of the CPIB went down to the Tanglin Police Division to meet the Commander to request for his help in picking up David Teo. The Commander thereafter instructed the appellant to call David Teo back to the station. When David Teo arrived, SSI Wong searched his desk, drawers, cabinet and car to gather evidence against him for corruption. The next morning, SSI Wong conducted a search at David Teo`s house.
David Teo was eventually charged with six counts of corruption by the CPIB after six months of investigation. He pleaded guilty to three charges and consented to the remaining three being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. All the charges related to obtaining sexual gratification. He was sentenced to a total of 20 months` imprisonment.
The appellant meanwhile was taken in for questioning at the CPIB at about 9.30 or 10am on 16 October 1998. He remained there for about 16 hours, after which time a statement was recorded from him at 1.50am on the morning of 17 October 1998 (`the CPIB statement`). He was eventually charged in court on 30 June 1999, and interdicted on 1 August 1999.
 The prosecution`s case 
 
 
 
The prosecution led evidence from a total of eight witnesses. The crux of their case however rested on the evidence of David Teo and one Mohd Jahabar bin Mohd Selleh (PW6) (`Jahabar`).
 Jahabar`s evidence 
 
 
 
Jahabar testified that he was a former senior investigation officer in the violent crime squad of the Tanglin Police Division. He tendered his resignation on 1 October 1998. Sometime in August 1998, Shairi introduced him to Jo and Angie. Between late August and September 1998, Jo and Angie informed Jahabar that David Teo was a lecher who was soliciting sex from them. The girls also claimed that David Teo had asked them for gifts and had brought them to watch obscene movies. Upon hearing this, Jahabar advised the women to lodge a report with the CPIB. The girls were hesitant and replied that they were not ready to do so. They were also afraid of repercussions as their shoplifting cases were still outstanding at that time.
On 15 October 1998, at some time before 3pm, Jahabar made one of his usual calls to the appellant. He had been calling the appellant regularly to inquire about the status of his resignation as well as certain disciplinary proceedings instituted against him by the Force. During this conversation, Jahabar also sought the appellant`s help to pay on his behalf an outstanding amount of $20 to the shopkeeper. During the course of the conversation, Jahabar was informed by the appellant that the latter was covering the post of CIO(IV) as Insp Elangovan was on leave. Upon hearing this, Jahabar recalled what Jo and Angie had told him previously, that David Teo was waiting for Insp Elangovan to go on leave or be transferred out before taking the opportunity to manipulate the investigation papers involving the two girls and present them to the covering CIO(IV). As such, Jahabar informed the appellant to be wary of any investigation papers presented to him by David Teo. Upon further probing by the DPP, Jahabar revealed: 
 
 
A ... I informed accused that I knew two girls, namely, Jo and Angie and that those two girls had informed me that they would be investigated by David Teo. David Teo had solicited for sexual favours. I also informed the accused about obscene VCDs as I recalled the girls had informed me they had watched obscene VCDs with David Teo. I felt that David Teo`s immediate superior on that day, the accused, should know and he should not be misled by David Teo. I also told accused that there are investigators watching obscene videos in the station.
  
 
 
In cross-examination, Jahabar added that he had informed the appellant that Jo and Angie were contemplating reporting the matter to the CPIB. He agreed however that the appellant had told him that he was very busy that day and that there were a lot of investigators queuing up for him with their investigation papers. The appellant also did not appear to be very responsive to what Jahabar was saying. In fact, when Jahabar started to talk about the matter concerning David Teo, the appellant merely interjected with the cursory `ah`, `okay`, `hmm`, `yeah` and Jahabar himself got the impression that the appellant was not taking the matter seriously. He also agreed that the office of the violent crime squad was normally very noisy and could not be sure if the appellant had heard everything he said.
After getting off the phone with the appellant, Jahabar contacted Insp Elangovan and related to him the same things which he had just told the appellant concerning David Teo. Jahabar testified that he felt the need to inform Insp Elangovan of this matter as he was of the view that the appellant had not taken him seriously. Before ending the conversation, Insp Elangovan uttered the words `serious ah` and asserted that he would pass the information on to the Commander.
 David Teo`s evidence 
 
 
 
David Teo gave evidence that on 15 October 1998, he received a call from the appellant at around 3pm in the afternoon whilst he was in the office. The appellant asked David Teo to meet him in the staff canteen on the third floor. David Teo went immediately. Upon arriving at the canteen, David Teo called for a drink. The appellant then came from the back and ordered his own drink before both men sat down. David Teo began the conversation by asking `Sir, what is going on? What happened?`, at which point the appellant told him that he heard that David Teo was under investigation by `Uncle Sam`, a term which David Teo understood to mean the CPIB. David Teo then asked the appellant who lodged the complaint against him to which the latter replied that he did not know and that he had just heard about it. Thereafter, the appellant told David Teo that, if they could not get him for the main complaint, they would go against him for all the smaller things, such as failing to update his police pocket book. The appellant further advised David Teo to get rid of anything which he should not have. When asked if the appellant went into the details of what he should get rid of, David Teo cited uncensored video compact discs (`VCDs`), police files or investigation papers which he had brought home, and basically anything else which might lead to a departmental action being taken against him.
Upon hearing all this, David Teo was seized with fear and guilt. He maintained however that he did not show his fear or guilt as he believed that the appellant did not know what he (ie David Teo) had done wrong. Thereafter, David Teo excused himself from the conversation and returned to his office. Back in the office, David Teo rummaged through his drawer and threw away some police bail bond forms. He then told the officer-in-charge of his squad, Staff Sgt Gary Wong (PW8) (`SSgt Wong`) that he had just heard that he was under investigation by the CPIB. In response, SSgt Wong told him to cool down as his face was very pale. At around 4pm, David Teo went home. At his flat, he gathered a few pieces of uncensored VCDs which he had brought from Malaysia and some old First Information Reports (FIRs), put them in a bag, and drove off to a track in Punggol where he burnt the items. He was unsure if the items in the bag included crime screenings, a computer software developed by the police which was capable of generating a suspect`s personal information.
When referred to the transcript of the taped conversation between Jo and himself on 15 October 1998, David Teo clarified that what the appellant had said was that if David Teo had brought any of his work or police notes home, then he should get rid of them. He could not recall however if the appellant had said that the CPIB was going to raid his house. As for the assertion that he had already burnt all the things, David Teo explained that, at the time when he was talking to Jo, he was seized with fear and guilt and was in a state of panic. He clarified that what he had meant by asserting that he had burnt all the things was that he had burnt them a few months back. When pressed on whether the appellant had told him that the CPIB was going to raid his house, David Teo`s response was that the appellant did say that the CPIB might check his office or house.
David Teo further testified that he was mentally preparing himself for the eventuality that the CPIB would indeed come to look for him. He admitted however that he did not really know what to do at that point in time and was basically adopting a wait-and-see approach. Moreover, he also knew in the first place that he had done some wrong things. Nevertheless, he felt that his mental preparation improved because of the `forewarning` from the appellant.
Finally, David Teo also emphasised that the items which he destroyed on 15 October 1998 were not linked to any of the corruption offences which he had committed. As such, his possession of bail bonds, uncensored VCDs, old FIRs and possibly crime screenings would not have helped the CPIB to investigate any seizable offence against him. When asked if those items would incriminate him in non-seizable offences, David Teo said that, at most, they would lead to a departmental action being instituted. He also denied the DPP`s suggestion that he had, as a result of the forewarning by the appellant, successfully destroyed evidence which might have assisted the CPIB in investigating corruption and other seizable offences against him.
In cross-examination, David Teo admitted that prior to 15 October 1998, he had never socialised with the appellant. In fact, as on that date, the appellant did not even know him, save for the fact that he was an investigator at the Tanglin Police Station. David Teo further gave evidence that 15 October 1998 was his day off. He had returned to the station at around 1pm because he had some work to clear. In particular, one Sani Supaat from the shoplifting squad had paged for him asking him to return to the office to attend to a bail matter. Thereafter, at around 2 to 3pm, David Teo brought a suspect to the appellant for the purpose of administering a warning. Soon after, the appellant called and asked to meet him in the staff canteen.
When asked to explain why he had destroyed evidence some months before 15 October 1998, David Teo averred that he was afraid that his wrongdoings would be exposed. He also agreed that his mental agony started some months before 15 October 1998 as he knew he had done some wrong things. Moreover, he was also in a constant state of anxiety and had trouble concentrating on his work as he did not know when the situation would blow up.
Moving on to what transpired at the meeting between the appellant and David Teo in the canteen, the latter denied that the appellant had started the conversation by saying that he heard that David Teo was watching VCDs in the office. He admitted however that he and a few other officers did watch VCDs in the office occasionally in order to pass time. David Teo also agreed with counsel`s suggestion that the appellant could have said words to the effect that, if he was doing any nonsense outside, he should stop them immediately. Thereafter, the following exchange transpired between David Teo and defence counsel: 
 
 
Q Put: Accused subsequently to emphasise the point that you should immediately stop the nonsense outside told you words to the effect that if `Uncle Sam` investigated you and even if they could not find anything for the offence they investigated you, they would still take action if they found VCDs at your work station and home? 
 
A If I can recall he said normally if `Uncle Sam` cannot get you for the main offence they would whack you for the smaller things. 
 
... 
 
Q Put: Accused told you again that if you have all these things to go home and to your work station to clear it - words to that effect. 
 
A Accused used the words that I do not want to know if you have done anything wrong but if you have things which are not supposed to be there like VCDs whether in the office or in the house you should get rid of them.
  
 
 
When asked if he was sure that the appellant had said that he did not want to know if David Teo had done anything wrong, the latter agreed that it could have been his impression. In his view, what the appellant was saying was not out of the blue as most police officers knew that if they were under investigation and the police could not get them for anything, they would get them for the `small things`. He agreed however that he had difficulty recalling the exact words used by the appellant. The impression that he had was that the appellant had come to tell him that he was under investigation and that he was in a way advising him that if CPIB could not get him for the main case, they would go for the smaller things, that is, conduct for which he could be prosecuted under the Police Force Act. He agreed that the appellant seemed to be more focussed on the disciplinary aspects of his case. Nevertheless, he was insistent that he did hear and understand the appellant to be telling him that he was under investigation and denied that he could have been mistaken.
 The defence 
 
 
 
The appellant elected to give evidence. He testified that he had been in the police force for some 24 years. He was posted to the Tanglin Police Station on 11 August 1997 and became the officer-in-charge of the violent crime squad. On 15 October 1998, he was covering the post of CIO(IV) as Insp Elangovan was on leave. As such, his workload on that day was extremely heavy.
Over lunch on 15 October 1998, the appellant heard Sani Supaat and SSgt Gary Wong discussing about a bailor who had been kept waiting in the office. He asked them what the matter was about to which Sani replied that it was David Teo`s bailor who had been kept waiting. They had paged for David Teo several times but the latter had not responded. Following from this, the appellant told himself that David Teo had a bad attitude and was lacking in responsibility. He also recalled that there was a rumour going around that David Teo had been watching VCDs in the office. As such, the appellant decided that he would give David Teo a pep talk about pulling up his socks if the opportunity arose for him to do so.
Later that same day, David Teo brought a suspect to the appellant for the purpose of administering a warning. Before they left, the appellant asked David Teo if he had settled his bail matter to which the latter replied that he had. The appellant did not comment on his lackadaisical attitude as he did not want to embarrass him in front of the suspect. After David Teo left, the appellant carried on with his work. There were other investigating officers waiting to see him and he also had to go through investigation papers which were submitted to him for perusal and direction. Whilst attending to the investigation papers, the appellant received a call from Jahabar asking about the status of the latter`s resignation, something which he had been calling the appellant about for some time now. He told Jahabar that the status was probably the same as when they last spoke. The appellant wanted to end the conversation as work was waiting for him. He told Jahabar that he was the covering CIO(IV) for the day and as such was very busy and could not talk to him. He recalled that sometime during the conversation, he heard Jahabar say something about David Teo watching VCDs, but asserted that this was nothing new to him as it was a common rumour going around. Jahabar then continued talking but the appellant was not paying attention as he was focussing on the investigating officers and investigation papers in front of him. When he finally wanted to end the conversation, the appellant became a bit abrupt and told Jahabar that he was busy and had to go. The appellant maintained that he did not hear Jahabar say anything about David Teo being investigated by the CPIB.
At around 3pm, the appellant went to the canteen to get a drink. On his way there, he decided to call David Teo for a pep talk. Hence, he obtained David Teo`s extension from the enquiry counter and asked the latter to meet him in the canteen. After the two men sat down, the appellant began the conversation by asking David Teo if he had been watching VCDs in the office. David Teo replied in the negative. The appellant then decided to impress upon him that he was serious about talking to him and about wanting him to pull up his socks. As such, the appellant cited a hypothetical scenario to him, something which he felt David could understand. The appellant said that, if `Uncle Sam` were to investigate him and could not find any evidence concerning the principal offence, they would take action against him for anything else which they discovered along the way. David Teo then repeated that he did not have any VCDs and wanted to excuse himself at which point the appellant told him that, whether it was VCDs or any other `nonsense outside`, he should get his act together. He explained that what he meant by `nonsense outside` was the frequenting of nightspots within the jurisdiction, which was something that police officers were not allowed to do. At this point, David Teo attempted to excuse himself again. The appellant then remembered that it was David`s off-day as a result of which he told David that, if he had any VCDs, he should not waste time, but should go home and get rid of them. The appellant asserted that his intention was really to tell David not to waste any more time and that he should pull up his socks and improve his attitude. He maintained that the session was intended only as a pep-talk and he was not out to find fault with David. His only reason in asking to speak to David was because he had heard about the latter`s bad attitude over lunch and as such, was concerned that David might get into trouble someday. The appellant insisted that he did not tell David that he was under investigation by `Uncle Sam` and denied that he had mentioned pocket diaries, police files, notes, crime screenings, FIRs or bail bonds. He also maintained that he did not know that there were, or were going to be, CPIB investigations into David, and that if he had known, he would not have spoken to him in the first place.
Under cross-examination, the appellant agreed that if he received information through an informal channel that an officer in the Tanglin Police Station was going to be investigated by the CPIB, informing the officer concerned of the same would be a gross violation of the Police General Order D45. When questioned about the phone call from Jahabar, the appellant denied that he heard Jahabar talking about repaying $20 to the storeman. He also maintained that he was trying to end the conversation as soon as possible and was not focused on what Jahabar was saying as he was very busy that day. Moreover, it was not the first time that Jahabar was pestering him about the same issues. As such, the appellant did not pay him much attention. He did however, hear Jahabar mention something about David Teo watching VCDs. When asked if Jahabar stated the nature of the VCDs in question, the appellant replied that Jahabar did not specify. In any case, the appellant felt that the nature of the VCDs in question was irrelevant as the bottom line was that no one was allowed to watch VCDs in the office in the first place, be they uncensored or perfectly innocent ones. The appellant reiterated the point that his only purpose in speaking to David Teo that afternoon was to give him a pep-talk over his work responsibility and there was never an intention to find fault with him. While he admitted that one of his reasons for wanting to speak to David was the fact that the latter had kept a bailor waiting that morning, he explained that he did not have the opportunity to bring this matter up as David had asked to excuse himself. When asked what he would have done if David Teo had admitted to watching VCDs in the office, the appellant replied that he would have gone to his desk to seize the VCDs and report the matter to management. While he conceded that the Board of Film Censors and the police would be involved where the VCDs were concerned, he denied that the CPIB would be involved as possession of uncensored VCDs or watching VCDs in the office did not entail any element of corruption. The appellant further explained that he had cited `Uncle Sam` in the course of the conversation only as an example to emphasise the seriousness of the VCD problem. As they were all police officers, he felt that the impact would not be as great if he had merely used the police force or its disciplinary board as an example to create an impression. As such, he cited the CPIB instead, something which he alleged was often done in similar contexts. He denied that his use of the CPIB as an illustration was illogical, despite the fact that he could not be sure if the VCDs in question, whether at home or in the office, were uncensored or legal ones. After all, there had been many instances of police officers being found with uncensored VCDs at home and in the office. As David`s superior for the day, the appellant was concerned that David did not end up in the same spot.
At this juncture, the prosecution applied to have the appellant`s CPIB statement of 17 October 1998 admitted into evidence. The application was allowed. The DPP referred the appellant to various paragraphs in the statement in which he had stated that he had confronted David Teo specifically with regard to obscene or uncensored VCDs. Thereafter, much issue was taken by the DPP with respect to the failure by the appellant to mention, in court, the precise nature of the VCDs in question. At this point, the appellant admitted that he could have been mistaken when he gave testimony to the effect that Jahabar had not mentioned the nature of the VCDs. Upon looking at his earlier statement, the appellant confirmed that this was the correct version. He denied however that his testimony in court was flawed and asserted that he had testified according to the best of his recollection.
Finally, the appellant agreed with the DPP that it was not good practice to forewarn a suspect who is under investigation, as doing so might lead to the destruction of evidence. He also agreed that to give a suspect clear notice of investigations would jeopardise the investigations. Moreover, it was also common sense that evidence relating to both the main complaint as well as to other offences disclosed during investigations was relevant and would be gathered by the investigating authority.
 The decision below 
 
 
 
The trial judge held that the prosecution had to prove three things in order to bring home a charge under s 26(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act: 
 
 
(i) that there was a hindrance of a CPIB officer; 
 
(ii) that the hindrance was to the execution of any duty imposed or power conferred under the Act; and 
 
(iii) that the person hindering did so with the requisite 
 mens rea 
.
  
 
 
Although no mens rea is specified in the section, the trial judge held and the prosecution conceded that mens rea is a necessary ingredient of the offence in question.
On the evidence, the trial judge found that Jahabar was a truthful witness and believed his evidence in its entirety. She found that Jahabar had indeed spoken to the appellant over the phone at around 3pm on 15 October 1998, and had told him about David Teo`s involvement with Jo and Angie and the fact that the ladies were contemplating reporting him to the CPIB. From the appellant`s own testimony, the trial judge noted that the appellant was aware that Jahabar was saying quite a lot of things to him. She disbelieved his explanation that he did not hear the entire conversation. There was no reason why he should only have heard the allegation about David Teo watching VCDs when this was the least serious of the other complaints against him which complaints she described as `shocking`. She found that the appellant had denied hearing the other `outrageous` matters as he would have been hard put to explain why he did not report this to his immediate superior SSgt Gary Wong but chose instead to speak to David directly. That the appellant had made regular interjections like `ah`, `hmm`, `okay` revealed that he must have been listening to everything that Jahabar was saying as there was no reason for him to put on a pretence.
With regard to the conversation in the canteen between the appellant and David Teo, the trial judge believed David`s version of it and disbelieved the appellant`s. In her opinion, it was incredible that the appellant had chosen to give David a pep talk directly so soon after the phone call from Jahabar. In addition, she also found it unbelievable that the appellant would allow David to leave in the middle of a pep talk for no good reason, particularly when the former had not even brought up the bail matter with him yet. The trial judge arrived at the view that the only reason why the appellant had called David that afternoon must have been because of the shocking complaints which he had heard from Jahabar. She did not believe his explanation about having cited the CPIB only as an illustration as there was no reason for him to suspect, at that point, that David would get into trouble with the CPIB. She felt it made no sense for him to cite the CPIB when all that he had heard, on his own evidence, was that David watched uncensored VCDs and had kept a bailor waiting on one solitary occasion. In the premises, she had no difficulty arriving at the conclusion that the appellant had indeed told David Teo that the CPIB was investigating him and had further advised the latter to get rid of his illicit VCDs and other police papers.
The trial judge then proceeded to consider the legal position with respect to s 26(b) of the PCA. She held that it was not necessary to show that the officer in question was at the time of the obstruction, engaged in the performance of a specific duty. In this case, Jo had made the complaint to the CPIB at around 3.15pm on 15 October 1998. From then on, SSI Wong of the CPIB must have embarked on his duty of investigating into David Teo`s alleged wrongdoing. In so doing, he had the powers of search and seizure with respect to any seizable offence disclosed in the course of his investigations. On SSgt Gary Wong`s evidence, David Teo had told him around 4pm that he had heard that he was under investigation. From this, the trial judge found that SSI Wong would have commenced his investigations at the time that the appellant spoke to David Teo, which must have been somewhere between 3.15 and 4pm. With regard to the element of hindrance, the trial judge found that the fact that David Teo was eventually successfully prosecuted for corruption was not a defence to the charge against the appellant. In her view, the act of the appellant in informing David Teo was done with the object that David be made aware of the danger that the CPIB may detect his offences and take evidence of them. As secrecy of the probe was essential to prevent destruction of evidence, forewarning David Teo presented a hindrance to CPIB`s investigations as it caused him to be mentally prepared and also led him to destroy VCDs in anticipation of a search. Finally, with respect to the mens rea required for the section, the trial judge held that knowledge was sufficient. As the appellant himself had admitted that forewarning a suspect had the effect of jeopardising investigations, in that it gave him time to tamper with witnesses and invent a defence, the trial judge was of the view that the appellant must have realised, when he spoke to David in the canteen, that the probable consequences of his actions would be to hinder investigations by the CPIB.
 The appeal against conviction 
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant did not challenge the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The main thrust of his argument before me was that the facts as found by the trial judge did not satisfy the essential ingredients of the charge proffered against his client. In particular, it was argued that the facts did not support the element of the charge that the appellant`s actions had `frustrated the investigations` of the CPIB into `criminal allegations` against David Teo. Counsel brought to my attention the fact that David Teo had himself testified that the items which he destroyed on 15 October 1998 were not in any way connected with or related to his corrupt activities. As such, it was contended that there was no evidence to suggest that the appellant`s act had hindered CPIB investigations or had made them substantially more difficult to perform. Moreover, it was further pointed out to me that s 17 of the PCA permitted a special investigator of the CPIB to investigate only seizable offences which were disclosed during the course of an investigation under the PCA. As the possession of illicit VCDs under the Films Act (Cap 107) was a non-seizable offence, it was contended that the CPIB did not have jurisdiction to investigate into possession offences by David Teo, as a result of which no hindrance to their investigations could be said to have been caused by the appellant`s actions. I gave these arguments careful consideration, but was satisfied at the end of the hearing that there was absolutely no merit in them.
 The law 
 
 
 
Insofar as is relevant, s 26 of the PCA states: 
 
 
26 Any person who - 
 
(a) refuses the Director or any officer authorised to enter or search, access to any place; 
 
(b) assaults, obstructs, hinders or delays him in effecting any entrance which he is entitled to effect under this Act, or in the execution of any duty imposed or power conferred by this Act; 
 
... 
 
shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.
  
 
 
The marginal note to s 26 reads `Obstruction of search`. At first glance, therefore, it appears that the section is targeted primarily towards situations in which CPIB officers are physically impeded or prevented from carrying out lawful and valid searches in the course of their investigations into corrupt activities. In fact, a great deal of the cases from other jurisdictions interpreting similar, albeit not identical, statutory provisions commonly feature the following typical factual scenario: Z, a police officer, arrives at certain premises with a valid search warrant and asks that he be allowed entry in order to conduct a search. At this point, the occupants of the house either quickly disappear through the backdoor or destroy whatever incriminating evidence is in the premises before letting Z in. In these cases, the courts have had no difficulty finding the offence of hindrance made out on the facts. At first instance therefore, it appears that s 26 of our PCA was also intended by its drafters to be directed principally towards instances of physical obstruction or hindrance to the execution of specific duties by CPIB officers. Nevertheless, the case law which has evolved in other jurisdictions has expanded the scope of situations to which similar provisions have been held to be applicable, particularly in the area of non-physical obstructions or hindrances. As there have been no reported local decisions dealing with the application of s 26, it is helpful in my view to refer to English and other Commonwealth authorities for guidance where necessary.
 Actus reus 
 
 
 
A plain reading of s 26 makes it clear that the actus reus requirements of the offence of hindrance are twofold: first, the prosecution has to show that the Director of the CPIB or one of his officers was executing a duty or power conferred by the PCA at the material time; and second, that the accused did an act which in fact hindered the execution of that duty.
I move on to consider the first element of the actus reus. In this respect, the Canadian case of 
R v Westlie
 
[1971] 2 CCC (2d) 315
 is instructive. That was a case which dealt with the application of s 110(a) of the Canadian Criminal Code concerning the offence of obstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty. It was held by McFarlane JA that it is not necessary, in order to support a conviction under s 110(a), for the police officer to be engaged in the performance of any specific duty at the time of alleged obstruction. In my view, this statement of the law must be correct. In fact, I would add to that statement the further exposition that it is also not necessary, in order to sustain a conviction under s 26 of the PCA, for the appellant`s actions to be directed towards any specific officer. It would be unduly restrictive to reduce within specific limits the general terms in which the duties of CPIB officers have been expressed, since the range of duties potentially exercisable by them is fluid and constantly expanding and, as such, cannot possibly be laid down in any exhaustive list. In my view, it is more convenient and appropriate to consider each case as it arises, and to determine whether on the facts, it can be said that the officer or officers in question were indeed acting in execution of their duties.
Turning to the facts of the present case, I had no doubt that SSI Wong, and even the officers of the CPIB in general, were acting in the execution of their duties at the time when the appellant spoke to David Teo. The CPIB is tasked with enforcing the provisions of the PCA, which statute is in turn intended to stamp out the grave social evils of bribery and corruption. As such, it may be said that the general scope of the duties of every CPIB officer encompasses the duty to prevent as well as to detect corruption offences and to bring all corrupt offenders to justice. This is a general duty which does not arise only in specific situations such as when a complaint is lodged, but is instead a duty which all CPIB officers are constantly acting to uphold. As such, I had no hesitation in holding that the officers of the CPIB were acting in execution of their duty within the meaning of s 26 at the time when the appellant spoke to David Teo. Even if one was to take a more restrictive reading of the section and require that a specific officer had to be acting in execution of a specific duty at the material time, I would also have had no difficulty arriving at the same conclusion. The main events in this case all occurred nearly simultaneously, and perhaps even coincidentally. Nevertheless, I think it was clear from the trial judge`s finding, which was not challenged by the appellant, that both Jo and Angie had arrived at the CPIB and had started to give their statements to SSI Wong before the appellant spoke to David Teo in the canteen. In my view, SSI Wong`s duty to investigate the women`s complaints commenced the very moment that a statement began to be recorded from them. Surely the instant a complainant walks into the station to make a report, investigations in its broadest sense would have begun from that point onward because, even at the receiving of the first information report, the officer in question would be under a duty to verify facts with or to pose relevant questions to the giver of the report. The word `investigation`, as used in the charge here and which might be expected to be used by the prosecution in future cases, should thus be given a broad meaning so as not to undermine the carrying out of investigative duties by both the police and the CPIB alike. An officer acts in the execution of his duty from the moment he embarks upon a lawful task connected with his functions as an officer, and continues to act in the execution of that duty for as long as he is engaged in pursuing that task. Part of the complaint in this case was of alleged acts of corruption by David Teo. Section 17(a) of the PCA renders any offence under the PCA a seizable offence, and confers upon any special investigator the power to investigate into such offences without a warrant. As such, upon disclosure of these allegations by Jo and Angie to SSI Wong, the latter, being a special investigator of the CPIB, not only had the power to investigate into those allegations, but was also required by law to do so.
Section 26 of the PCA should not be construed in any narrow or restricted sense, but should be given a broad operation in order to protect the performance of all CPIB duties, not just some. The words used in the section are general: `in the execution of any duty`. The natural inference to be drawn from this is that the section ought to apply whenever the officer in question is doing something which can fairly and reasonably be regarded, given the circumstances, as a carrying out of his duty. The generality of the section is further fortified by the consideration that it attempts to cover a very wide range of possible interferences with the work of the CPIB: assault, obstruction and delay. In the result, I had no doubt that the first element of the actus reus of the offence under s 26(b) was more than amply satisfied on the facts of this case.
Moving on to the second actus reus element, what needed to be proved was that the appellant did an act which in fact hindered the CPIB in general or SSI Wong in particular, in the execution of their investigative duties. Several judicial pronouncements in Australia have expounded on the meaning of the word `hinder` and the correct interpretation to be given to it in the context of the offence in question. I shall consider these authorities in turn. The first case was a decision by the Supreme Court of South Australia. In 
Plunkett v Kroemer
 
[1934] SASR 124
, it was held that for an offence of hindering a police constable in the execution of his duty under s 20 of the Australian Police Act 1916-1929, an actual hindrance has to be proved. The word `hindrance` was further defined as causing some appreciable obstruction to, or interference with, the performance by the officer of his duty. It was acknowledged by the court however that `hinder` by itself was not a word of art that was capable of precise definition. Instead, it is always a question of fact and degree whether in the circumstances of each case the obstruction or interference was appreciable. If the officer is frustrated in his attempt to perform his duty, or retarded in the execution thereof, then clearly he has been hindered. Alternatively, a valid case of hindrance is made out where the act in question renders the officer`s duty substantially more difficult of performance.
The next case was 
Patch v Ebbage
 
[1952] QSR 32
. That was a case concerning s 36 of the Australian Traffic Act of 1949 which sets out the offence of obstructing or hindering a member of the police force in the exercise of his powers or duties under the Act. The Full Court of Queensland held that the existence or non-existence of an act of obstruction by a person to a member of the police force in the exercise of his duties is not to be determined by the success of the act done for the purpose of obstructing the member of the police force. Although that was a case concerning the `obstruction` limb of the provision, I have no doubt that the same principle applies with full force to the offence of `hindrance`. As a matter of language, there is hardly a clear line of distinction between the meaning of the two words, `obstruct` being frequently defined in the dictionaries as `hinder` and `hinder` being often defined as `obstruct`. It would appear therefore that the same factual matrix could potentially give rise to a charge under either limb of s 26. In the result, I am of the view that a person can be found guilty of the offence of hindrance regardless of whether or not his conduct was successful in its purpose. A hindrance which is or may be surmounted is no less a hindrance.
Applying the above principles, the question to be asked in the present case was whether or not the act of the appellant in speaking to David Teo at the material time had the effect of hindering the CPIB or one of its officers in the execution of their investigative duties. In my view, clearly it did. In respect of the corruption offences, David Teo himself testified that he had become better prepared mentally after hearing the appellant`s warning. To my mind, this was sufficient to show that the CPIB`s duties of investigation into David Teo`s affairs became substantially more difficult of performance as a result of the forewarning from the appellant. That David Teo might not have destroyed any items relating to his corruption offences after the appellant`s warning was irrelevant. Mental preparation on the part of a suspect who has been tipped off is sufficient to satisfy the element of hindrance in the charge. In fact, this was eventually conceded, and in my view rightly so, by counsel. Certainly when a suspect has been forewarned of impending investigations against him, his mind automatically becomes alive to the real possibility of his being detected and apprehended, as a result of which the opportunity arises for him to invent or craft a false defence in his favour or perhaps even escape to evade apprehension completely. Whether or not he is able to do so successfully is really a matter of sheer chance and presumably even wit, but whatever the case, liability of the person giving the warning should not be made dependent on such uncontrollable factors. In my opinion, the fact of the forewarning itself, being more than capable of equipping a suspect with the opportunity of avoiding detection or arrest, constitutes sufficient hindrance for the purposes of the offence under s 26(b). Whether or not or in what way the suspect eventually chooses to exploit that opportunity cannot be held to be decisive of the question whether or not the offence of hindrance is made out vis-Ã -vis the person giving the warning. To do so would be to make liability hinge on the fortuitous circumstance of how the person warned happened to react to the warning. In my view, there is no room for such a measure of uncertainty in the criminal law. On the facts as found by the trial judge, I did not think it was unreasonable or far-fetched to infer that the fact that David Teo had become better- prepared mentally for the investigation into his affairs rendered the CPIB`s tasks more onerous and substantially more difficult in this case. Of course, it would have been better if the prosecution had called someone from the CPIB to testify that their investigations were in fact impeded or made more tedious in David Teo`s case. Nevertheless, the failure to call such a witness was not fatal to the charge. At most, it was only a question of the evidence before the court. I think that, in most cases, it would not be difficult for the court to draw the inference that a suspect`s mental preparation did in fact have the effect of making the police or the CPIB`s duties substantially more difficult to accomplish. To my mind, such a conclusion was only natural and one which could ineluctably be drawn in the circumstances.
In any case, I was amply fortified in the view that the CPIB`s duties were in fact hindered by the appellant`s actions by the fact that David Teo destroyed his illicit VCDs pursuant to the warning from the appellant. I found counsel`s argument that there was no hindrance caused because the CPIB had no power under s 17 of the PCA to investigate into non-seizable offences (of which the possession of illicit VCDs under the Films Act is one) to be extremely tenuous and wholly without merit. In my view, counsel`s submission took a rather narrow and microscopic view of the range of duties of a CPIB investigator under the PCA. There is no doubt that the duty prescribed by s 17 of the PCA relates only to seizable offences which are disclosed in the course of an investigation under the PCA. However, s 19 of the PCA specifically empowers a special investigator of the CPIB, with the fiat of the Public Prosecutor, to investigate into 
 any 
 offence under 
 any 
 written law, which must include non-seizable offences. The section reads: 
 
 
19 The Public Prosecutor may by order authorise the Director or a special investigator to exercise, in the case of any offence under any written law, all or any of the powers in relation to police investigations given by the Criminal Procedure Code.
  
 
 
In my view, this latter section not only confers the power, but also imposes the duty, on the CPIB to investigate into all offences which are disclosed in the course of their investigations into corruption offences under the PCA. Counsel urged before me that, without the prior sanction of the Public Prosecutor, a special investigator of the CPIB cannot investigate into non-seizable offences. Hence, as no authority of the Public Prosecutor had been obtained by SSI Wong in this case, he could not be said to have been acting in the execution of a valid duty which was capable of being hindered at the time when the appellant spoke to David Teo. I rejected this contention entirely. In my view, the destruction of the VCDs by the appellant did in fact hinder the CPIB in its duties under the PCA. While the main duty imposed by the PCA on special investigators of the CPIB is the detection and investigation of corruption activities, there is also the more general duty of reporting or investigating other offences which may incidentally be disclosed during the course of investigations into acts of corruption. Accepting that the CPIB cannot legitimately pursue or continue an investigation into non-seizable offences without the authority of the Public Prosecutor, I had no doubt nevertheless that where such offences are in fact disclosed, the special investigator in question is cloaked with the duty to seek the requisite authority from the Public Prosecutor. Such authority would not and cannot in the first place be sought if evidence of the non-seizable offence is destroyed or disposed of even before they are revealed during the course of investigations. Hence, the destruction of the VCDs by David Teo made it impossible for the CPIB to discover possible offences of possession by him, as a result of which, they were unable to carry out their duty under the PCA of obtaining the order of the Public Prosecutor to investigate further into such offences. It should also be noted that under s 116 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`), non-seizable offences can and should ordinarily be investigated into immediately upon receipt of information of their commission. The order of the Public Prosecutor is only necessary when it is the special powers of investigation conferred by ss 120, 121, 125 and 126 of the CPC relating to the attendance and examination of witnesses and the taking of statements, which are sought to be exercised. It appears therefore that the authority of the Public Prosecutor is essential only where it is the special powers of investigation which seek to be effected. Such authority is not required at the preliminary stage of the investigations, which special investigators are no doubt empowered and tasked to undertake with the same fortitude as they would when investigating seizable offences. In this case, the preliminary stage was hardly even arrived at due to the destruction of the VCDs by David Teo. In the result, I had no hesitation in holding that the appellant`s act of warning David Teo in fact hindered the CPIB in the execution of its investigative duties into criminal allegations against David Teo, be they of solicitation for sexual gratification or of being in possession of pornographic VCDs.
 Mens rea 
 
 
 
Moving on to consider the level of mens rea required for the offence of hindrance under s 26(b), it is clear that the section is silent with respect to mens rea. The defence contended and the prosecution conceded that the offence under s 26(b) is not one of strict liability. As such, the burden is on the prosecution to prove that the accused possessed the relevant degree of mens rea beyond reasonable doubt. In this case, the level of mens rea used in the charge was that of `knowledge`. Neither party made any quarrel about this. Nevertheless, it is useful to consider various foreign authorities to see if we are able to determine the proper scope of mens rea for the section.
Leonard v Morris
 
[1975] 10 SASR 528
 was a case concerning s 6 of the Australian Police Offences Act 1953-1972. That section reads: 
 
 
(2) Any person who hinders or resists any member of the police force in the execution of his duty shall be guilty of an offence.
  
 
 
In that case, it was held, in response to the question what was the mental element required for the section, that the defendant must 
 intend 
 substantially to impede a particular individual in the execution of his duty. In this respect, it is immaterial that the defendant did not know that the individual was a police officer, or that the individual was at that time, engaged in the performance of his duty. Alternatively, it is sufficient to show that the defendant was aware that his act was likely to impede or obstruct certain acts being done. The relevant mens rea therefore was held to be the intention to impede or the knowledge that he is likely to impede an individual from doing a certain thing. There is no requirement that the accused must know that the individual was a police officer or that he was acting in the execution of his duty at the relevant time.
In my view, the above interpretation of the mens rea requirement for the offence of hindrance is unduly strict. Take for example the case of a plainclothes policeman P who is chasing after a suspect in a street. A, a passer-by, not knowing that P is a policeman acting in the course of duty, deliberately sticks out his foot and trips P. On the test of mens rea espoused in 
 Leonard v Morris 
, A would be found guilty of the offence of hindering a police officer despite his lack of knowledge about P`s status as this is irrelevant to liability. While A should no doubt be charged with say the use of criminal force under the Penal Code, it is difficult to see why he should be charged with the more serious offence of hindering a police officer, which carries a higher penalty, when he did not know that the person whom he was hindering was a police officer executing his duty, which could well have been an incidence of mere fortuity. Enabling the prosecution to proceed on a more serious charge when the mens rea is the same, simply because in one case the person `hindered` happened to be a policeman in the execution of his duty also accords unnecessarily favourable protection to police officers who may consequently abuse the authority reposed in them. In any event, the extra-deterrent effect intended from the enhanced punishment set out for hindrances of police officers becomes superfluous if the offender did not and could not possibly have known that the person hindered was a police officer in the execution of his duty. At the same time however, the law must prevent accused persons from presenting the argument that lay persons could not possibly have known the full scope of police duties, as a result of which they did not have the knowledge that P was acting in the execution thereof. In my view, a reasonable half-way house would be to require the prosecution to prove that the accused either knew or had reason to believe that the person hindered or obstructed was a police or CPIB officer, whom he also either knew, or had reason to believe, was acting in the execution of his duty. I shall revert to this point again later in my judgment.
The next case is 
 Patch v Ebbage 
 (supra), which dealt with the following section from the Australian Traffic Act 1949: 
 
 
36 A person shall not 
 
(a) obstruct or hinder any member of the police force in the exercise of his powers or duties under this Act.
  
 
 
With respect to the question of mens rea, it was said in that case that the gist of the offence of obstruction lies in the intention with which the act is done. The court opined that there is a great difference between giving a warning with a view to preventing the continuance of a possibly unlawful act and to procure observance of the law or for some other lawful purpose, and giving a warning so that the possibly unlawful act should be suspended or desisted from merely while there was a danger of the police detecting it and testing its legality. Only if the act was done with the latter intent would the person giving the warning be guilty of the offence of obstruction.
Moving on to s 53 of the UK Police Act 1964 and s 129(a) of the Canadian Criminal Code 1993, these provisions are materially dissimilar from our s 26(b) in that the mens rea of `wilfully` is explicitly spelt out in these foreign provisions. At first brush therefore, it appears that all the cases interpreting these provisions may be distinguished, on the ground that the species of mens rea is expressly spelt out in the statutes concerned while s 26(b) on the other hand is silent in this respect. Before dismissing these authorities as irrelevant however, regard should first be had to s 186 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), which sets out a similar, corresponding provision for the offence of `obstruction of a public servant in the discharge of his public functions`. In that section, the term `voluntarily` is explicitly set out to be the requisite mens rea, which term is in turn defined in s 39 of the Penal Code as being either intention, knowledge of likelihood or reason to believe. The learned authors of 
 Ratanlal & Dhirajlal`s Law of Crimes 
 (1997 Ed) opine at p 142 that the Penal Code`s definition of the term `voluntarily` bears resemblance to the definition of `wilfully` under English law. When viewed in this context, the English and Canadian authorities interpreting the meaning of the word `wilfully` become relevant, at least to the extent of determining the appropriate scope of the word `voluntarily` as found in s 186 of the Penal Code.
A review of the conclusions reached by the various English and Canadian courts about the meaning of `wilfully` in offences of obstruction presents the following definition: A person is said to wilfully obstruct an officer in the execution of his duty if he deliberately does an act which, though not necessarily `aimed at` or `hostile to` the police, in fact prevented an officer from carrying out his duty or made it more difficult for him to do so, and if he 
 knew 
 and 
 intended 
 that this conduct would have that effect: see eg 
Rice v Connolly
 
[1966] 2 QB 414
; 
Lewis v Cox
 
[1985] 1 QB 509
 and 
R v Gunn
 
[1997] 113 CCC (3d) 174
.
What then should be the appropriate level of mens rea required under s 26(b) of the PCA? Having considered the various statements of principle espoused above, I came to the conclusion that the starting point for determining the relevant mens rea should be s 186 of the Penal Code which deals with the corresponding offence of obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his duties. The question which then needs to be asked is whether or not some difference in the degree of mens rea required for the two sections should nevertheless be maintained in view of the fact that the punishment under s 26(b) of the PCA (one year`s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000) is significantly higher than that under s 186 (three months` imprisonment and a fine of $500) of the Penal Code. Some might argue that the fact that mens rea is specifically laid down by the legislature in respect of one offence but not the other suggests that some distinction must have been intended. On my part, I could not agree with that argument. There does not appear to be any good reason why the mens rea for two substantively similar offences should be different. In my view, the difference in punishment is meant only to emphasise the added severity with which Parliament viewed the obstruction or hindrance of CPIB officers, whose overriding duty to eradicate bribery and corruption must have been regarded as more important and thus deserving of greater protection than the duties of ordinary public servants. In the premises, the relevant mens rea for s 26(b) is either intention, knowledge or reason to believe. Hence, for a charge under s 26(b) to be proved, the prosecution has to prove one of the following: 
(i) that the accused intended by his actions to hinder a police officer in the execution of his duty; or 
(ii) that the accused knew that he was by his actions likely to hinder a police officer whom he knew was in the execution of his duty; or 
(iii) that the accused had reason to believe that he was by his actions likely to hinder a police officer whom he had reason to believe was in the execution of his duty.
This view would also accord with the interpretation given to the word `wilfully` by the English and Canadian authorities. At this juncture, it is also pertinent to emphasise the point made in these authorities that whether or not an accused may be said to have acted `wilfully` is often judged more from the point of the likelihood of the effects caused than from the doing of the act itself.
Returning now to the facts of the present case. The prosecution proceeded on the mens rea of knowledge. It was not defence counsel`s argument that the appellant did not have the requisite level of knowledge as specified in the charge. In my view, there was no question that the appellant in this case knew that in informing David Teo of impending CPIB investigations against him and in advising him to get rid of his VCDs and other police papers, he would thereby be hindering the CPIB in its investigations. A person is said to have acted with `knowledge` where he is aware that something exists, or is almost certain that it exists or will exist or occur. Jahabar informed the appellant on 15 October 1998 that both Jo and Angie were contemplating reporting David Teo to the CPIB. From this telephone conversation, it must have been apparent to the appellant that CPIB investigations into David Teo`s affairs were either afoot or imminent. In fact, it might be said that the commencement of CPIB investigations into David Teo`s misconduct was at this point a real, as opposed to being merely a fanciful, possibility and the appellant was no doubt acutely aware of it. In subsequently informing David Teo of the same, the only purpose he could have intended or knew was likely to achieve must have been to make it more difficult for the CPIB to carry out its tasks. To my mind, there was no other way in which the appellant could explain the advice to destroy VCDs and other police papers. On a realistic plane, it will be seen that it is not possible to define the offence of hindrance without alluding to questions of motive or purpose. It is plain that the appellant himself was a senior police inspector. Having been in the Force for some 24 years, I had no doubt that he, more than anyone else, would have been familiar with the workings of the police and the CPIB, and would clearly have understood the importance of secrecy to an investigation or probe. After all, he admitted that he knew that a failure to pass on information of the kind received to his superiors or to the CPIB was a gross violation of the Police General Order D45. While it is not every breach of an internal disciplinary directive which opens a person to criminal prosecution, certainly this must be the case here when what was involved was a flagrant disregard of an important disciplinary guideline. I did not think there was any room for the argument that the appellant did not know that the CPIB would as a result of his action be hindered in their investigations into David Teo. As mentioned, what is important is the state of mind of the appellant vis-Ã -vis the effect or consequence of his actions, and not so much his state of mind with respect to the doing of the act of tipping-off itself. In this case, the appellant failed to show any motive or reason for his action other than to assist David Teo in evading arrest and detection by the CPIB and consequently to impede or frustrate the investigative process. It will be recalled that the appellant was merely the covering CIO(IV) for the day. As such, he was not David Teo`s direct or immediate superior and, under normal circumstances, both men would hardly have had even scarce contact with each other. When the warning given was viewed in this context, it became clear that the appellant`s purpose could not merely have been the innocuous one of encouraging David Teo to stop the continuance of some possibly unlawful act or to procure observance of the law, but was rather to aid in the concealment of the evidence of a crime and to seek the suspension of its commission only for as long as there was a danger of the police detecting it. Certainly where the act is done with the latter view in mind, that is more than ample evidence of the requisite knowledge needed for the offence of hindrance.
In the light of the foregoing reasons, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven all the elements of the charge against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. I accordingly dismissed the appeal against conviction.
 The appeal against sentence 
 
 
 
In mitigation, counsel submitted that his client had co-operated with the CPIB throughout, and did not at any time deny that he did in fact have the conversation with David Teo in the canteen. For my part, I was conscious of the fact that the appellant did not derive any benefit or gratification whatsoever from his act and that no physical or otherwise quantifiable loss was in the end caused to the authorities, David Teo having been eventually prosecuted for corruption successfully. At the same time, no physical injury of any kind was caused to any CPIB officer nor was it likely that the conduct here would be repeated. I further took account of the fact that the appellant was a first offender who had hitherto had a perfect, unblemished record in all his 24 years as a police officer which was amply backed by numerous highly-impressive written testimonials of his exemplary conduct. It was also significant that the prosecution of the appellant had already led to his interdiction and that the dismissal of his appeal against conviction would almost certainly lead to his being sacked from the Force. It was strongly urged before me that this was sufficient punishment for him, given that he is already 41 years old, and was most probably due to retire and receive his pension in just four years` time, all of which he would now lose in the light of his conviction. Moreover, I was also asked to take into consideration the fact that he had a wife and young daughter to support, and would have great difficulty starting life from scratch in a different occupation after this case was over.
Conscious as I was of the strong mitigating factors in this case, I came to the view that a custodial sentence was nevertheless warranted on the facts. Firstly, this was the kind of offence which by its nature was very difficult to detect. In fact, the CPIB in this case only became aware of the appellant`s involvement after listening to the chance conversation between David Teo and Jo. If not for this conversation, there would be no telling if the appellant would ever have been caught. Likewise, if only Jo and Angie had chosen to go to the CPIB just one day late, then perhaps even David Teo would have succeeded in completely covering his tracks and getting away altogether. The serious and obvious repercussions of this do not need repeating here. Secondly, I also had to take into account the fact that the appellant was not just a normal civilian, but a senior police inspector, and as such, a public servant who should be held to higher standards in the discharge of his duties than the ordinary man in the street. At the same time, the court must also be concerned to mete out a punishment that will deter similar-minded individuals from acting in disregard of the authority of important regulatory and law-enforcement agencies such as the CPIB or the police in general. Any attempt to interfere with the duties of these agencies gravely disturbs the impartial workings of our criminal justice system and has the effect of undermining the fundamental efficacy of our public service as a whole. To my mind, this is conduct which should not be lightly condoned but should instead be strongly discouraged and the punishment given in cases like this should accurately reflect these considerations. In my opinion, police officers like the appellant, by virtue of their office, are placed in an extremely vulnerable position, in which they are extra-susceptible to becoming recipients of monetary inducements in return for the disclosure of critical information relating to the status of criminal investigations or the timing of impending raids. In such situations, the imposition of a fine would hardly have any deterrent or punitive effect on the offender at all, since the monetary gratification received beforehand would more than adequately compensate him for his loss. As such, I had no doubt that a custodial sentence was more appropriate in cases such as the present which involved a relatively senior member of the police force.
Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I found that the sentence of six weeks was still excessive. In the result, I reduced the sentence to one of three weeks` imprisonment instead. This, in my view, would adequately reflect both the mitigating and aggravating factors highlighted above.

: The plaintiffs were the tenants of a warehouse space at CWT Warehouse Distripark at Jalan Buroh. On 18 April 1993 a quantity of paper stored by the plaintiffs at the said warehouse was damaged by water which escaped from an elbow joint in some piping at the said warehouse. The plaintiffs obtained compensation for the loss suffered from their insurers, namely, American Home Assurance Co, who then, under their right of subrogation brought the present claim against the two defendants.
The owners of the warehouse had, in early April 1993, entered into a contract with BS Engineering Co Pte Ltd (the second defendants), a company that provided fire protection equipment and services to, inter alia, supply 11 additional fire hosereels and install them to the existing pipe system at the said warehouse. The second defendants sub-contracted the installation of the fire hosereels to Tan Huan How (the first defendant).
The first defendant commenced work at the warehouse on 15 April 1993. The elbow joint from which the leak occurred was an elbow joint a short distance along the pipe on which the first defendant, in pursuance of his sub-contract, had installed a T-joint for the purpose of connection to an additional fire hosereel. The plaintiffs claimed that in doing work on the piping system the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs and were in breach of that duty in that they (a) failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the water pipes on which work was carried out would not burst, (b) failed to adequately and/or properly fasten the joints of the water pipes, and (c) caused and/or permitted water to escape from the water pipes. The plaintiffs also relied on the doctrine of 
 res ipsa loquitur 
.
The first defendant denied any negligence on his part and alleged that in any event the leak was from an area on which he had not carried out any work. He alleged that the leak was due to some previous contractor using an inadequate form of joining to secure the elbow joint. The second defendants also denied any negligence. In addition, the second defendants denied that they were under a duty of care to the plaintiffs but if they were they had complied with that duty by engaging the first defendant as competent independent contractor skilled in the area of such works.
The plaintiffs called three witnesses in support of their claim. The first witness was a warehouse supervisor employed by the plaintiffs. His evidence related to the fact that the water that leaked had caused damage to the plaintiffs` goods stored at the premises and that the plaintiffs had recovered a sum of $114,509.21 for the loss caused from their insurers leaving an excess of $24,300 under the policy which the plaintiffs had to bear themselves. He had no personal knowledge of how or why the leakage occurred.
The second witness was an insurance adjuster who visited the scene on 25 April 1993, seven days after the incident. The leak had by then been repaired (by the first defendant as it happened). In his report dated 10 May 1993 he ascribed the cause of the leak to a water pipe that had burst at the elbow joint near a fire hosereel at Bay 6 of Module 2 of the warehouse. In cross-examination, the witness readily admitted that he had no personal knowledge of where the leak occurred or why it occurred. He admitted that all that was stated in his report was a repeat of what he had gathered from the plaintiffs` employees when he visited the site for his inspection.
The third witness called by the plaintiffs gave evidence relating to the terms of the policy of insurance taken out by the plaintiffs. He had nothing material to say about the water leakage.
The only direct evidence before the court of where the leak occurred and why it occurred was the evidence of the first defendant. The first defendant testified that, as a sub-contractor of the second defendants, he had installed additional fire hosereels at the CWT warehouse. On 18 April 1993 - a few days after he had made the installation - he was told by the second defendants that a pipe at the warehouse had burst. He immediately went to the site and saw that a (vertical) fire riser pipe at Bay 6 had given way at the elbow joint.
The first defendant testified that the point where the elbow joint had given way was unconnected with the work he had earlier done to the piping. The work he had done in that vicinity involved only the horizontal pipe at that elbow joint. He testified that his worker, under his supervision, had installed a T-joint to that horizontal pipe to connect it to an additional fire hosereel. The first defendant testified that his worker did not do any work in connection with the vertical pipe and the elbow joint. He stated that he was with his worker when the T-joint was being installed and nothing that his worker did would have affected the connection between the vertical pipe and the elbow joint.
The first defendant further testified that on close inspection of the dislodged pipe he noticed that the ring used to affix that pipe with the elbow joint was made of copper. He testified that a copper ring should only be used with copper pipes. In this case, as the pipe and elbow joint were of stainless steel, a copper ring was not suitable and a ring of a harder material, such as brass, should have been used. In his view, the joint had given way because of the use of the unsuitable copper ring.
The first defendant also testified that he had noticed when he initially closed the main valve before commencing work on the pipes that the main valve was not fully opened. When the works were completed the main valve was opened to the full. The first defendant opined that the vertical pipe had not dislodged itself from the elbow joint at an earlier stage because the main valve was not fully opened but that when the valve was fully opened the pressure generated had become too high for that joint (with its copper ring) to withstand.
The first defendant told the court that he was, that morning, requested to repair the dislodged pipe. He obliged. He took out the copper ring and replaced it with a brass one and then re-set the vertical pipe into the elbow joint. Thereafter when he turned on the water supply there was no further problem.
The first defendant was questioned at length on his competence to do piping work. This line of questioning was directed towards showing that the first defendant lacked competence in this field and towards establishing that the second defendants, in employing an incompetent person to do the installation work, had failed in their duty of care towards the plaintiffs.
The first defendant`s evidence was that he commenced doing plumbing work in 1981 and has since (except for the period he spent in National Service) been in the same line of business. He told the court that the installation of T-joints along the pipe was a very simple and routine sort of work and was an undertaking that was well within his competence.
Tan Leh Theng (DW2), the Managing Director of the second defendants, also testified that the installation of the fire hosereels was a simple job for a plumber. Tan testified that prior to engaging the first defendant he had made enquiries about the first defendant`s competence in plumbing and he had received very favourable comments. He denied that the second defendants were in breach of their duty of care in having sub-contracted the installation to the first defendant.
The issue whether the defendants, in carrying out their work, owed a duty of care towards the occupants of the warehouse was not seriously challenged by the defendants. What was challenged was whether they were in breach of that duty of care.
Counsel for the plaintiffs, in his closing submissions, conceded that the witnesses called by the first defendant had no direct knowledge of the cause of the dislodgment of the vertical pipe with the elbow joint and told the court that the plaintiffs were relying essentially on the maxim of res ipsa loquitur.
The general rule in cases such as this is that it is for the plaintiffs to prove their allegations of negligence and breach of duty. The courts, however, have recognised that strict adherence to this rule can in certain cases cause hardship to a plaintiff and have developed the principle of res ipsa loquitur. 
Scott v London and St Katherine Docks Co
 
[1861-73] All ER 246
, has for long stood as the leading authority on this principle. In that case Sir William Erle CJ observed as follows: 
 
There must be reasonable evidence of negligence, but, where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant, or his servants, and the accident is such as, in the ordinary course of things, does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from want of care.
 
 
 
Our courts have adopted this approach (see 
Teng Ah Kow & Anor v Ho Sek Chiu & Ors
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 769
 ).
The defendants in this case were not carrying out general repairs to the piping system at the warehouse. They were merely installing T-joints at specific points of the pipeline in order to connect the piping system to the additional fire hoses. The dislodgment that caused the leak did not happen in that section of the pipes on which such work was carried out and, in any event, happened three days after the first defendant had completed the works. That being the case, the plaintiffs would have difficulty bringing themselves within even the first condition required for the principle of res ipsa loquitur to apply, namely, that `the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant, or his servants`. But even if this was not so and it could be said that the leakage occurred at a point within the management of the defendants, the plaintiffs would have to cross a second hurdle: they would have to show that `the accident was such as, in the ordinary course of things, does not happen if those who have the management use proper care`. These words do not appear apposite in this case. The leakage at the elbow joint could have happened for any number of reasons unconnected with the defendants and unconnected with the management of the pipes by the defendants.
In the case of 
 Scott 
, a bag of sugar, for some unknown reason, fell on the plaintiff whilst the plaintiff was standing near the door of the defendants` warehouse. As the warehouse was at the time under the management of the defendants, the court ruled that in the absence of explanation by the defendants, those facts constituted reasonable evidence that the accident arose from a want of care by the defendants. In the present case, neither the plaintiffs` premises nor the piping system were under the management of the defendants when the leakage occurred. The fact that the leakage occurred three days after the first defendant installed the T-joint may well be pure coincidence; the leak could be due to the negligence of a third party and there may well have been a leak even if no work whatsoever had been carried out on the piping system. For the maxim res ipsa loquitur to apply the facts must speak for themselves: to adapt the words of Sir William Erle CJ, the fact situation must be one where it would be reasonable to conclude, in the absence of an explanation by the defendants, that the leak occurred because of the defendants` breach of his duty of care. Such a conclusion did not appear reasonable in this case.
Res ipsa loquitur is, as Chao Hick Tin J in 
 Teng Ah Kow & Anor v Ho Sek Chiu & Ors 
 reiterated, `no more than a rule of evidence of which the essence is ... that an event which in the ordinary course of things is more likely than not to have been caused by negligence is by itself evidence of negligence`. In the present case, I was not satisfied that the fact that three days after a T-joint had been affixed to an adjoining horizontal pipe, the vertical pipe was displaced from the elbow joint, could be said to be an event which, in the ordinary course of things, was more likely than not to have been caused by the negligence of the defendants in the installation of the T-joint. To establish breach of the duty of care it was, in my view, incumbent on the plaintiffs to have adduced evidence at least to the effect that in affixing the T-joint the defendants would have interfered with that section of the pipe where the leak occurred and that it was this interference that caused the leakage.
In the absence of such evidence the plaintiffs` case, in my view, had no foundation and a plea at the close of the plaintiffs` case of no case to answer may well have succeeded. The defendants, however, made no such plea. Instead, they adduced evidence of how the work was carried out. In particular, the first defendant testified that in installing the T-joint his worker did not (and would have had no need to) interfere with that end of the elbow joint to which the horizontal pipe was connected.
I had no reason to reject the first defendant`s evidence. His evidence was credible and there was nothing before me to lend support to the speculation by the plaintiffs that in installing the T-joint, the first defendant`s worker may have loosened the connection between the elbow joint and vertical pipe. I also had no reason to reject the first defendant`s testimony that the use of a copper ring at the connection between the vertical pipe and the elbow joint was the cause of the leakage. The first defendant was a plumber with many years of experience and in the absence of evidence to the contrary from another expert, I was not prepared to reject the first defendant`s testimony on this point.
In the circumstances, even if the fact that the first defendant had installed a T-joint at the horizontal pipe close to where the leak occurred was a reasonable basis on which the principle of res ipsa loquitur could be invoked, the first defendant, in my view, had given a sufficient explanation and shown that the leakage did not occur from any want of care on his part.
For the above reasons, I dismissed the plaintiffs` claim against the defendants. I will add, in respect of the claim against the second defendants, that I was satisfied that the first defendant was more than competent to handle the installation of the fire hosereels and the second defendants in engaging the first defendant as an independent contractor to install the fire hosereels were not in breach of their duty of care.

: This is an appeal by the defendants against the decision of the learned assistant registrar assessing damages payable to the plaintiffs as follows: 
(1) shift of gross sales of common advertisers from plaintiffs to first defendant - $654,320; and 
(2) loss of goodwill of potential advertisers not captured in shift of gross sales from common advertisers to the first defendant - $30,000.
The learned assistant registrar also awarded interest at 6% per annum on the above amounts from the date of assessment and costs fixed at $5,000 to the plaintiffs.
I reduced the damages under the first head to $50,000, dismissed the appeal against the award under the second head and made no order as to costs for the appeal.
The plaintiffs are appealing against the said reduction in damages. [The appeal was withdrawn - Ed.]
 The background 
 
 
 
The plaintiffs sued the defendants for malicious falsehood and succeeded in their action before Lai Siu Chiu J who granted an injunction and ordered that interlocutory judgment be entered with damages to be assessed by the Registrar. The following facts appear in the judgment of the learned trial judge.
The plaintiffs are the publishers of the 
 Singapore Yellow Pages Commercial and Industrial Guide 
 (`The Yellow Pages`). The first defendant is a company whose business is to compile, publish and market directories of telephone numbers and business addresses in a Compact Disc format (`The CD Rom`). The second defendant is a director of the first defendant while the third defendant is its managing director. Both are also shareholders of the first defendant incorporated on 10 November 1995.
The second and third defendants used to work for the plaintiffs in sales and marketing but left the plaintiffs` employ in 1991 and 1992 respectively. The plaintiffs` direct marketing manager (Giselle Chia) also left the plaintiffs in 1996 to join the first defendant.
On 27 May 1996, the plaintiffs received a copy of a fax dated 23 May 1996 sent by the first defendant`s Thomas Lim to Michael De Krester Consultants PR and Management. That document described the CD Rom and guaranteed its circulation `at a minimum of 200,000 copies for local distribution alone (as many as the Commercial Yellow Pages if not more), with additional copies for circulation in the Asean region. In addition to this, we would also have own web site on the Internet to ensure international readership`.
In December 1996, the plaintiffs received a letter of complaint dated 17 December 1996 apparently from one of their advertisers but without the author`s name or address. That letter enclosed a leaflet entitled `Reasons why you should advertise with CD-Biz` in which the following statement appeared: 
 
 
1 Higher Circulation 
 
(Reach all potential customers) 
 
Highest circulation ever for a directory publication both locally and in the ASEAN region. (Local circulation of 200,000 copies - more than the commercial Yellow Pages).
  
 
 
In January 1997, the plaintiffs received another letter of complaint from one of their advertisers, Yew Aik Hung Pte Ltd, which was in the following terms: 
 
We have been informed by your company that the circulation for the Commercial Yellow Pages is 350,000 copies. However, CD-Biz Directories Pte Ltd had claimed that their local circulation is `200,000 copies - more than the commercial Yellow Pages` which show a great discrepancy in the figure claimed. Please refer 2nd copy forwarded. Whose claim is correct?
 
 
 
If CD-Biz Directories` Pte Ltd`s claim is true, we, as your advertiser will be very disappointed as this may account for one of the reason why we have not been receiving good response from your Yellow Pages` advertisement beside an error committed by your staff.
 
 
 
We feel that the Commercial Yellow Pages, having been established for years, should do better than what CD-Biz Directories Pte Ltd had claimed.
 
 
 
Advertising in your Commercial Yellow Pages is not cheap.
 
 
 
We seek a clarification for the great difference in the claim and appreciate an early reply as several of our business associates are aware of this discrepancy too.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs also received from another of their advertisers a set of the first defendant`s promotional materials comprising the leaflet mentioned earlier together with a comparison chart which stated that the CD Rom`s circulation was 200,000 while that for the Yellow Pages was 180,000 and that while the first defendant charged $6,000 for first page full colour screen and $500 for each subsequent page, the plaintiffs charged $45,000 for full page size and $6,000 for name card size advertisements.
The plaintiffs claimed that the statements made by the first defendant in the fax dated 23 May 1996 and in the leaflet were false and/or were published maliciously. They claimed that the circulation of the Yellow Pages in 1996 was 390,000 and not 180,000 or 200,000. The falsehood was said to be malicious because the plaintiffs and the first defendant were competitors. Further, ex-employees of the plaintiffs worked for the first defendant and would know the estimated advertising rates and circulation tables and the first defendant therefore made the said statements knowing they were false or recklessly not caring whether they were true or false in order to induce members of the trade or the public to believe that advertising in the CD Rom was more attractive than in the Yellow Pages. The second and third defendants were said to be liable as joint tort feasors. Accordingly, the plaintiffs claimed injunctive relief as well as damages.
The first defendant contended that the yearly circulation of 180,000 for the Yellow Pages was computed or published without the authority of any of the defendants. The first defendant admitted, however, that it procured, ordered or approved the statement contained in the leaflet. The first defendant further averred that the circulation for the Yellow Pages was based on reasonable and/or honest inference and information from various sources, including the former employees of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs` own projected circulation based on their rate sheets for 1996 and the first defendant`s own estimate based on the number of business telephone lines as listed in the Singapore Phone Book Business Listing of July 1996 (with a 30% to 40% discount for non-collection). The first defendant also denied that the words complained of were made maliciously or recklessly.
The second and third defendants denied that they had directorial control of the first defendant. They alleged that they were only employees and were responsible for the circulation figure of 200,000 for the Yellow Pages but denied that the words impugned were false or made maliciously or recklessly. For the same reasons canvassed by the first defendant, they believed that the figure of 200,000 was correct.
The learned trial judge disbelieved the defendants` witnesses who said that they were not aware of the circulation figures of the Yellow Pages or that they had arrived at the figure of 200,000 by analysis or logical deduction. Her Honour found that the circulation of the Yellow Pages for 1996 was above 300,000. She also decided that circulation meant the actual number of copies of the Yellow Pages collected or distributed. Her Honour found that in their zest to compete for advertisers, the defendants made the statement that the circulation of the Yellow Pages was 180,000 or 200,000 well knowing that it was not true or recklessly. She was prepared even to hold that the statement was actuated by improper motive on the part of the second defendant, the third defendant and Giselle to boost the circulation of the fledgling CD Rom at the expense of the more established Yellow Pages for pecuniary reasons.
On the law, the learned trial judge held that although the plaintiffs did not need to prove special damage under s 6(1) of the Defamation Act (on which they relied), it appeared from the evidence adduced that they had suffered some loss of reputation if not revenue as a result of the malicious falsehood. This was evidenced, she opined, by the two letters of complaint, one of which was anonymous. The said s 6(1) reads: 
 
In any action for slander of title, slander of goods or other malicious falsehood, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage -
 
 
 
 
(a) if the words upon which the action is founded are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff and are published in writing or other permanent form; or 
 
(b) if the said words are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in respect of any office, profession or calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the time of the publication.
  
 
 
 
 
 The assessment before the assistant registrar 
 
 
 
 
 
Before the learned assistant registrar, the parties agreed that they would proceed on the basis of the affidavits filed for the assessment of damages as well as those filed for the trial proper, with no need for cross-examination of the deponents.
After hearing the parties` submissions, the learned assistant registrar awarded damages under the two heads mentioned earlier. For the shift of sales from the common advertisers to the first defendant, she adopted the plaintiffs` computation of the decline in their revenue of $1,308,640 and discounted 50% thereof.
 The evidence and arguments 
 
 
 
The first defendant started canvassing for advertisements in their CD Rom from May to November 1996. When the inaugural CD Rom was produced in early 1997, there were a total of 596 advertisers. 484 of these were also advertisers in the plaintiffs` 1996 Yellow Pages issued around July 1996.
According to Go Choon Huat, the plaintiffs` Marketing Support Executive, of the 484 `common advertisers`: 
(1) 56 cancelled their advertisements for the 1997 Yellow Pages; 
(2) 185 decreased their advertisements for the 1997 Yellow Pages; 
(3) 245 increased their advertisements for the 1997 Yellow Pages; and 
(4) 2 remained unchanged.
Twenty-six advertised for the first time in both the 1997 Yellow Pages as well as the CD Rom. The loss in annual gross revenue to the plaintiffs from the above cancellation and decrease amounted to $1,308,640.
Leong Fook Luen, a director of the plaintiffs, said in his affidavit that the advertising sales from the Yellow Pages came largely from renewals each year from existing advertisers. Each year, there would also be increases, decreases and cancellations from such advertisers. In addition, new advertisers might come on board.
According to Leong, apart from the said shift of gross sales of about $1.3m to the first defendant, the plaintiffs also suffered a sudden surge in the decrease and cancellation (`D and C`) rates for the 1997 Yellow Pages compared to the preceding three years. In percentage terms, the different D and C rates were as follows:

It was said that there was therefore a significant increase in the D and C rates for the 1997 Yellow Pages when compared to those for the preceding three years and particularly for the preceding two years.
Using the difference between the D and C rates for the 1996 and the 1997 Yellow Pages, there was an upsurge in D and C rates of 5.49%. In monetary terms, 5.49% of the 1996 quarterly sales of almost $15m translated into about $3.28m decrease and cancellation of annual sales.
Leong proposed an alternative method of computing the loss suffered by the plaintiffs by comparing the D and C rates for the 1997 Yellow Pages with the average of the D and C rates for the years 1994 to 1996. That would result in an increase in D and C rates for 1997 of 4.23%. This would amount to about $2.53m loss in annual sales through decrease and cancellation.
Three alternative methods of computation of damages were therefore placed before the court as follows: 
(1) Shift of sales from the common advertisers to the first defendant - $1.3m. 
(2) Increase in D and C for 1997 compared with 1996 - $3.28m. 
(3) Increase in D and C for 1997 compared with the average of 1994, 1995 and 1996 - $2.53m.
The defendants` case was that in each year, there were always advertisers who either cancelled or decreased their advertisements with the plaintiffs from the previous year (as could be seen from the plaintiffs` own figures quoted earlier). This was so even before the first defendant entered the market in 1996 to publish their CD Rom in 1997. There was a whole spectrum of reasons why advertisers would cancel or decrease advertisements with the plaintiffs besides the actions of the defendants.
One possibility in respect of the common advertisers was that the defendants` CD Rom could offer more comprehensive coverage because the advertisements therein were not only in CD Rom format but were also available on the Internet so that they could be assessed by anyone anywhere in the world. Further, the CD Rom could offer comprehensive coverage because the advertisements could be represented under unlimited categories unlike the print medium (like the Yellow Pages) where a handphone vendor might have to list his advertisement under various categories (such as handphones, telephone equipment, telecommunications equipment) in order to ensure comprehensive coverage. The more categories he listed his product in, the more he would have to pay. The first defendants` directory could also be viewed in 256 colours and could be printed out as a brochure. Further, there was a powerful built-in search engine which allowed searches by products/services, by brands or by advertisers` names. The search engine could also link the search to other related products/services.
Returning to the computation of the plaintiffs` D and C rates, the defendants showed that the D and C rate for the common advertisers in 1997 as contrasted with that for 1996 was 19.15%. This was 0.97% lower than the average D and C rates for the preceding three years (1994 to 1996) which was 20.12%. It was also much lower than the D and C rate for 1997 in respect of all of the plaintiffs` advertisers (24.35%). As the total advertising revenue from the common advertisers represented more than 10% of the plaintiffs` total revenue for 1996 and 1997, the above computations were statistically significant.
The defendants also asserted that 1997 saw the beginning of the Asian economic crisis with businesses shrinking or folding up altogether. There were also other competitors producing directories for commercial and industrial products such as The Green Book and the CIDB Directory.
Taken together, all these factors could account for the upsurge in the D and C rates from an average of 20.12% for 1994 to 1996 to 24.35% for 1997. Accordingly, the defendants averred, there was no loss or damage suffered by the plaintiffs.
 The decision of the court 
 
 
 
 
 
 McGregor on Damages 
 
 (1997 Ed) states the following propositions at para 1943 under the heading `Injurious Falsehoods other than Passing Off`: 
 
The damages will vary according to what interest of the plaintiff the defendant`s false statement attacks. ... Finally, the false statement may be in relation to the plaintiff`s business more generally: he will here be entitled to recover for any consequential loss of business. Thus in 
 Riding v Smith
, where the defendant falsely stated that the plaintiff`s wife, who assisted him in his business, had committed adultery with the parish incumbent, the plaintiff recovered for the falling off in his business which followed. And in 
 Ratcliffe v Evans
, where the defendant published in a newspaper the false statement that the plaintiff had closed down his business, damages were awarded for the general falling off of the plaintiff`s custom. Similarly, in 
 Worsley v Cooper
 it was held that damages could be given for the falling off of the plaintiff`s business by reason of the defendant`s distribution of circulars to the plaintiff`s customers falsely implying that the plaintiff had parted with his business and that the defendant had succeeded to it. In such circumstances it would seem that the plaintiff could recover not only loss of profits but any proven loss of business reputation or goodwill.`
 
 
 
At para 1944, the learned author states, with reference to s 3 of the English Defamation Act 1952 (the equivalent of our s 6 Defamation Act): 
 
The present position is therefore this. With statements falling within s 3 the plaintiff need not allege and prove specific pecuniary loss as the court will infer the existence of pecuniary loss and the damages will be at large in a similar sense to that in inducement of breach of contract. With statements falling outside s 3 the plaintiff must still allege and prove specific pecuniary loss, although the court will be satisfied with general evidence of such loss where this is all that the circumstances of the case will allow.
 
 
 
Where non-pecuniary loss is concerned, paras 1945 and 1946 of 
 McGregor 
 are illuminating: 
 
There remains the question of non-pecuniary loss. Although s 3 of the Defamation Act 1952 continues to reflect the association of injurious falsehood with defamation because the statements singled out as not requiring allegation and proof of special damage are very similar to those defamatory statements which are actionable per se, there is still an interesting difference between such injurious falsehoods and such defamatory statements in relation to non-pecuniary loss. Whereas with defamatory statements actionable 
 per se
 the principal head of damage is the injury to reputation which is non-pecuniary loss, with those similar injurious falsehoods which fall within s 3 of the Defamation Act 1952 the principal, and perhaps the only, head of damage is the pecuniary loss that the plaintiff has suffered. Section 3, by dispensing in these cases with the requirement of allegation and proof of specific pecuniary loss for success in the action, thus impliedly confirms the view that for all injurious falsehoods only pecuniary loss will ground the action, a view negatively supported by the absence of decisions awarding non-pecuniary loss, occasionally expressly hinted at in the cases, and generally prevalent in this area of tort.
 
 
 
Whether, where pecuniary loss is satisfactorily shown, damages for non-pecuniary loss may be given in addition has long been uncharted, in relation both to those injurious falsehoods now falling within the provisions of s 3 of the Defamation Act 1952 and to those still controlled by the common law. Apart from Lord Denning MR in 
 Fielding v Variety
 Incorporated expressing his view that damages can only be recovered for `probable money loss and not for ... injured feelings`, the authorities have been silent, but now the Court of Appeal in 
 Joyce v Sengupta
 has addressed, without there deciding, the question. The plaintiff, a lady`s maid to the Princess Royal, was suing the defendant, a newspaper`s crime correspondent, for falsely stating in a published article that she had stolen the Princess`s intimate letters. The defendant argued that as a matter of law damages were irrecoverable for the plaintiff`s anxiety, distress and injury to her feelings. The court did not find it necessary to decide the point but Sir Donald Nicholls VC in a valuable judgment gave cogent reasons for allowing a measure of recovery. `Take the example,` he said, `of a person who maliciously spreads rumours that his competitor`s business has closed down ... The owner of the business suffers severe financial loss. Further, because of the effect the rumours are having on his business he is worried beyond measure about his livelihood and his family`s future. He suffers acute anxiety and distress. Can it be right that the law is unable to give him any recompense for this suffering against the person whose malice caused it? Although injury to feelings alone will not found a cause of action in malicious falsehood, ought not the law to take such injury into account when it is connected with financial damage inflicted by the falsehood?`
 
 
 
To limit damages for injurious falsehood to pecuniary loss would, he added, mark out a clear boundary but `it would suffer from the drawback of failing to do justice in the type of case I have mentioned. I instinctively recoil from the notion that in no circumstances can an injured plaintiff obtain recompense from a defendant for understandable distress caused by a false statement made maliciously.`
 
 
 
The Vice-Chancellor was, however, concerned that, if non-pecuniary loss were once allowed, it would be difficult to set coherent limits to potential recovery, both to the circumstances for recovery of non-pecuniary loss and to the types of non-pecuniary loss recoverable. He need not have been so concerned; the courts are perfectly capable of, and accustomed to, deciding when and how far to give damages for the omnibus injury to feelings. The matter is one of policy and it is thought that here policy should endorse recovery in general for injured feelings. What the Vice-Chancellor was particularly and rightly concerned to exclude, and indeed stated that it would be excluded as inappropriate in an injurious falsehood action, was the other and very different head of non-pecuniary loss, namely, injury to reputation. This is in line with the Court of Appeal`s decision very soon afterwards for its exclusion from the tort of conspiracy.`
 
 
 
It was submitted by the defendants that loss of goodwill for businesses was equivalent to loss of reputation for individuals, that such non-pecuniary loss had never been awarded in an action for malicious falsehood and that the appropriate cause of action in which to seek damages for loss of reputation was defamation.
The plaintiffs contended that loss of goodwill was for the general loss of custom in respect of those who did not advertise in the Yellow Pages but who could have been affected by the falsehood perpetrated by the defendants. The plaintiffs submitted that they could recover not only loss of profits but also any proven loss of business reputation or goodwill, relying on 
E Worsley & Co v Cooper
 
[1939] 1 All ER 290
, a case concerning passing off and not malicious falsehood.
In real terms, the loss of goodwill or business reputation pertains to the loss of profits resulting from a pool of potential advertisers who could have been dissuaded from signing up with the Yellow Pages after reading the false statements disseminated to them in the defendants` promotional materials. This head of damages is nothing more than a corollary of the other one dealing with advertisers who have already signed up with the Yellow Pages. In principle, I do not see why such loss should not be allowed. It is of course impossible to quantify as neither party would know how large the pool of potential advertisers so affected was. It is, however, reasonable to say, on a balance of probabilities, that some potential advertisers could have been affected thus. It is no different from the situation where one passes falsehood that a certain stall-holder`s prices are generally 10% above market prices or that his customers are not as numerous as he has claimed. Conceivably, some consumers who have never patronised that stall but have heard the falsehood could decide not to purchase anything from him at all. Where loss can be shown but cannot be quantified, it is justifiable to award nominal damages. The plaintiffs asked for $$50,000, the learned assistant registrar awarded $30,000. I do not find her award outrageously high or low and therefore confirmed her decision on this.
I now deal with the outstanding and more financially significant issue of loss of profits from the shift of business. Firstly, any award of loss of profits should not be on the basis of gross but of net profits, however small the expenses needed to generate those profits may be. Secondly, the mathematical formulae proposed by the plaintiffs appear attractive but the factual premises on which they depend have not been established. Out of two written complaints, only one bothered to identify itself. Obviously, we are not able to know what the reaction of that anonymous advertiser was - whether he decreased, cancelled, increased or maintained his advertisement with the Yellow Pages. As for the known advertiser (Yew Aik Hung Pte Ltd) who was peeved enough to write the strongly worded letter of complaint to the plaintiffs and whose reaction was apparently relied on as epitomising the general reaction of other advertisers in the Yellow Pages, it is highly significant to note that the same advertiser not only did not cancel or decrease its advertisement in the 1997 Yellow Pages, it in fact increased it. This can be seen in the documents exhibited in Go Choon Huat`s affidavit. This shows that this advertiser, who was the only known documented displeased customer, has somehow been reassured by the plaintiffs and that its misgivings have been assuaged to the extent that it was willing to renew and increase its commitment to the Yellow Pages. This is on top of the fact that Yew Aik Hung Pte Ltd also decided to advertise in the defendants` CD Rom. As for the alleged oral complaints made to the plaintiffs, for the same reason as that for the anonymous letter writer, we are not able to gauge what their response was.
What all this shows is that it is not a straightforward case of comparing yearly revenues to show how much business has been lost as a result of the falsehood. As Yew Aik Hung Pte Ltd`s case demonstrates, there might be no causal link at all in certain cases. If this is so for a disgruntled customer concerned enough to write a letter to the plaintiffs, it could surely apply with at least equal force to those who have kept silent or have resorted only to oral enquiries/complaints or anonymous letters. After all, the ubiquity of the plaintiffs` Yellow Pages in Singapore is obvious to all.
The sales figures of the plaintiffs for the various years do not show a consistent trend for the different components. While acknowledging that circulation is of crucial importance to advertisers, we should not underestimate the novelty value of the defendants` CD Rom. It is not in print form and is certainly less bulky than the Yellow Pages although it is not a stand-alone directory in that it requires computers to run it. It has the electronic wizardry to enable quick and comprehensive searches and, on the Internet, knows no geographical boundaries. 1996 and 1997 were within the era of the exponential growth of the Internet, which was and still is the focal point of forward-looking enterprises. It would be churlish to brush this novelty value aside and attribute the shift in business primarily to the false claims that the circulation of the Yellow Pages was only about 200,000.
One other factor proffered as a possible cause for the upsurge in the plaintiffs` D and C rates was the economic downturn in 1997. While general economic conditions could have affected businesses and consequently their advertising budgets, they were probably not significant in 1996 and in the first six months of 1997, during which time the plaintiffs would be canvassing for advertisements for their July 1997 Yellow Pages. It has been generally accepted that the Asian economic meltdown was precipitated by events that occurred in and after July 1997 and therefore after the publication of the 1997 Yellow Pages. However, the fact that the defendants` CD Rom made its debut in January/February 1997 while the plaintiffs` Yellow Pages appeared only in July 1997 may also have contributed to the D and C rates for 1997. It would not be surprising to find that a substantial number of common advertisers, having allocated their advertising budget or part thereof to the CD Rom, saw no need to advertise to the same extent or at all in the Yellow Pages that appeared some months later.
While I was willing to accept that loss in profits had probably been caused, I was not persuaded that the loss could be computed so neatly and methodically as suggested by the plaintiffs. As with the loss of goodwill, loss of profits was probable but was not capable of being quantified, certainly not on the state of evidence adduced by the plaintiffs. It would be highly illogical to extrapolate from Yew Aik Hung Pte Ltd`s case that the advertisers (or 50% of them) who decreased or cancelled their advertisements with the plaintiffs did so because of the false statements. One swallow does not a summer make and in this case the bird does not even seem alive. In the circumstances, as we are concerned with existing advertisers here, an award slightly higher than that given for the loss of goodwill should compensate the plaintiffs for their loss of profits. Accordingly, I awarded $50,000 for this head of claim.
As the defendants` appeal has succeeded on one count and failed on the other, I made no order as to costs in respect of the appeal before me.

: The plaintiff`s claim against the defendants is for damages for breach of their duty of care in the delivery of a Stencillaser machine (`the machine`) from the first defendant`s warehouse at the Changi Cargo Complex to the plaintiff`s factory on the third level of the industrial building at 164, Kallang Way, [num ]03-24, Singapore. At the close of the hearing, I found for the plaintiff. I awarded it S$218,143.27 being costs of replacement of the damaged parts inclusive of installation, less the salvaged value. This sum is to carry interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of service of the Writ. I also awarded costs to the plaintiff. The defendants have appealed to the Court of Appeal [the appeal was withdrawn - Ed]. I now give my reasons.
 The parties 
 
 
 
The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Singapore. It is engaged in producing stencils for use as solder paste printing in circuit boards.
The first defendant is a freight forwarding company incorporated in Singapore. It is associated with another freight forwarding company, Danzas GmbH, Hanover-Airport, Germany (`Danzas GmbH`).
The second defendant undertakes the transportation of cargo for the first defendant within Singapore as its subcontractor providing vehicles, equipment and manpower.
 Events leading to these proceedings 
 
 
 
In January 1995, the plaintiff purchased the machine from its manufacturer LPKF CAD/CAM SYSTEME GmbH, Hanover, Germany (`LPKF`) for DM497,000 inclusive of installation and commissioning, FOB Hanover. It was to be used for cutting stainless steel into stencils. The accuracy required is 20 micron. It is therefore a very high precision and sensitive equipment.
For airfreighting the machine from Hanover to Singapore, LPKF entrusted the job to Danzas GmbH. Danzas GmbH informed first defendant of this on or about 16 January 1995.
On receipt of the information, the first defendant`s Senior Sales Executive, Steven Ong, made an appointment to see Ms Koh Mui Khim (`Ms Koh`), the plaintiff`s Accounts Supervisor.
On 17 January 1995, Steven Ong called on Ms Koh, offering the first defendant`s services for airfreighting the machine from Hanover to Singapore and then transporting it to the plaintiff`s factory.
Subsequent to the meeting with Ms Koh, Steven Ong submitted a quotation for, inter alia, the following: 
(i) airfreighting the machine from Hanover Airport to Singapore Changi International Airport (`Changi Airport`) at DM 2.50 per kilo. 
(ii) transporting same from Changi Airport to plaintiff`s factory at S$0.15 per kilo. 
(iii) charges for the use of a Hiap crane - S$150. 
(iv) uncrating and disposal of crates - $120.
The Hiap crane was required because the weight of the consignment was about three and a half tons. The quotation contained a clause (`the incorporating clause`) at the bottom. It read: 
 
All business transacted in accordance with SAAA`S standard trading conditions. Copy available on application.
 
 
 
SAAA stands for `Singapore Aircargo Agents Association`.
 
 
 
Clauses 15 and 16 of SAAA`s Standard Trading Conditions read: 
 
Clause 15
 
 
 
Limitation of liabilities
 
 
 
 
(i) The Company shall only be responsible for any loss of or damage to goods or for any non-delivery or mis-delivery if it is proved that the loss, damage, non-delivery or mis-delivery occurred whilst the goods were in the actual custody of the Company and under its actual control and that such loss, damage, non-delivery or mis-delivery was due to the wilful neglect or default of the Company or its own servants. The Company`s liability begins from the time of receipt of the goods in the contracted condition and state and terminates at the time of delivery to other carriers or the consignees. 
 
(ii) The Company shall only be liable for any non-compliance or mis-compliance with instructions given to it if it is proved that the same was caused by the wilful neglect or default of the Company or its own servants. 
 
(iii) Save as aforesaid, the Company shall be under no liability whatsoever however arising, and whether in respect of or in connection with any goods or any instruction, business, advice, information or service or otherwise. 
 
(iv) Further and without prejudice to the generality of the preceding sub-conditions (i) or (ii) or otherwise, be under any liability whatsoever for any consequential loss or loss of market or fire or consequence of fire or delay or deviation however caused.
  
 
 
Clause 16
 
 
 
Rate of limitation
 
 
 
In no case whatsoever shall any liability of the Company howsoever arising and notwithstanding any lack of explanation exceed the value of the relevant goods or a sum at the rate of SGD1,000.00 per tonne of 1,000 kilos on the gross weight of the goods whichever is the lesser on a pro-rata basis.
 
 
 
As LPKF had entrusted the airfreighting of the machine from Hanover to Singapore to Danzas GmbH with `freight collect` at Singapore, the plaintiff accepted the first defendant`s quotation.
In the meantime, in mid-January 1995, Tony Wong Cheok Ban (`Tony Wong`), a service engineer, and Azman Shah (`Azman`), an engineer, of the plaintiff, were sent to LPKF`s plant in Hanover to familiarise themselves with and be trained in the operation of the machine. While on attachment, they tested the machine and witnessed the packing. They returned to Singapore on 30 January 1995. The machine arrived the next day. The first defendant took delivery of the machine consigned in three crates from the Airfreight Terminal and stored them in its warehouse at the Changi Cargo Complex on 1 February 1995. The crates had markings of an arrow pointing upwards, umbrella and glass. The arrow marking denotes that the crate must face upwards. The umbrella marking means that the cargo should not be allowed to come into contact with water. The glass marking indicates the fragility of the contents.
The first defendant engaged as its subcontractor the second defendant to transport the machine from its warehouse to the plaintiff`s factory.
On the morning of 4 February 1995 at around 1000 hours, the three crates arrived at 164, Kallang Way on board two trucks. Two smaller crates containing the control unit and the laser board were on board the bigger truck with a fixed canopy cover. It was driven by Yap Peng Huak. The bigger crate containing the marble table and the X-Y positioner (`the X-Y unit`) was on board the smaller truck which did not have a fixed canopy cover. It was driven by Chua Cheng Huat. The crate was covered with a canvas sheet. It was a wet day in the vicinity of Kallang Way, with alternating rain and drizzle.
On arrival at 164, Kallang Way, the two trucks were parked at the rear loading bay. The crate containing the control unit was unloaded onto the loading bay where it was unpacked. The control unit, mounted on wheels, was pushed to the plaintiff`s factory and placed in position pointed out by Azman. The second crate was similarly unloaded and moved into position by the second defendant`s workers using a pellet jack.
The crate containing the X-Y unit could not be unloaded without the Hiap crane. The Hiap crane had been ordered by the second defendant. But it arrived late.
While waiting for the arrival of the Hiap crane, the second defendant`s workers removed the canvas sheet covering the crate. They then removed two side panels of the crate. The X-Y unit wrapped only with a plastic sheet, was thus exposed to the rain.
Seeing that the two side panels had been removed, Azman checked and found the X-Y unit wet with rain water. He informed Steven Ong who touched it and confirmed it was wet.
When the Hiap crane eventually arrived, it could not operate at the rear loading bay because of an overhead shelter. So the truck with the X-Y unit on board was driven round the building to the front loading bay. This was done without the side panels and without the canvas sheet being put back in place. There was also a thick piece of wood resting on it.
After the truck arrived at the front loading bay, the X-Y unit was uncrated. A belt was slung around it. It was then lifted by the Hiap crane from the truck and placed on the loading bay.
The second defendant`s workers then discovered that their pellet jack was not of suitable size and could not be used to move the X-Y unit from the loading bay to the plaintiff`s factory. Chua Cheng Huat then went to look for a suitable pellet jack. Pending his return, the X-Y unit was left on the loading bay. All this while, it was still raining/drizzling.
When Chua Cheng Huat returned later with a suitable pellet jack, the X-Y unit was transported and placed in position in the plaintiff`s factory as directed by Azman.
According to the plaintiff, the whole operation was completed at 1900 hours. The delay was caused by the late arrival of the Hiap crane at 1500 hours and the lack of a suitable pellet jack. The defendants however said that the Hiap crane arrived at 1300 hours and the delivery was completed at 1500 hours. At 1900 hours, Azman spotted rust on the X-Y unit indicating that corrosion, due to contact with water, had taken place. Azman informed Tony Wong who then tried unsuccessfully to remove the rust by wiping it with a piece of cloth.
On 5 February 1995, LPKF`s engineers arrived to reassemble, hook up and commission the machine. They installed it on 6 February 1995 and tested it. The cutting was wavy. The machine had lost its required accuracy due to the corrosion of the X-Y unit. On 7 February 1995, they tried unsuccessfully to repair it by fine-tuning. The X-Y unit was eventually replaced, on the advice of LPKF that repairs could not restore the machine to its required accuracy.
 These proceedings 
 
 
 
On 25 October 1995, these proceedings were commenced against the first defendant. The writ with the statement of claim was then amended to join the second defendant. The claim against the defendants is for breach of duty of care.
The issue before me was whether the corrosion was caused by contact with water when the X-Y unit was exposed to the rain/drizzle during the unloading operation as contended by the plaintiff or was it caused by condensation on the flight from Hanover as contended by the defendants.
In support of their case, the defendants relied on the evidence of Dr Daniel John Blackwood, a senior lecturer at the Department of Materials Science, National University of Singapore. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Dr Blackwood gave his opinion as follows: 
 
In my opinion, even if there was nine hours of exposure to rain, it is insufficient time for steel to corrode to the extent that corrosion products become visible to the human eye.
 
 
 
It is my opinion that the corrosion observed on the X-Y positioning unit was due to contact with liquid water for a number of days and that the most likely source of this water was condensation during the flight between Germany to Singapore.
 
 
 
Dr Blackwood`s evidence was discredited by an experiment conducted in court by the plaintiff`s expert witness, Mr David Tay Yew Huat of Matcor Technology & Services Pte Ltd. The experiment began at 1140 hours with samples as follows:
 
 
Sample A
 
-
 
a machined mild steel plate with oil coating
 
 
 
Sample B
 
-
 
a machined mild steel plate with no protection
 
 
 
Sample C
 
-
 
three new screw bolts and nuts with washers with oil coating
 
 
 
Sample D
 
-
 
old and used bolt provided by Dr Blackwood
 
 
 
 
The samples were exposed to water. Two and a half hours later, all four samples showed visible signs of corrosion in the form of rust formation. Dr Blackwood`s opinion that condensation during the flight from Hanover to Singapore was the most likely cause of the corrosion is also not consistent with the absence of corrosion on the components packed in the other two crates that arrived on the same flight with the crate containing the X-Y unit.
I was therefore of the opinion that the corrosion on the X-Y unit was caused by contact with rain water because the X-Y unit was exposed to rain/drizzle from the time it arrived at 1000 hours at 164, Kallang Way until it was delivered to the plaintiff`s factory, be it at 1500 or 1900 hours.
Who then was to blame for allowing the X-Y unit to be exposed to the rain/drizzle during the unwarranted delay in the unloading operation due to the lack of proper equipment.
The first defendant was awarded the job by the plaintiff because of its expertise in the transportation of sensitive equipment. This was the evidence of Steven Ong: 
 
 
Q: What is the nature of your company`s business? 
 
A: Freight forwarding. 
 
Q: How long has your company been established? 
 
A: Since 1987. It`s associated with Danzas of Germany. 
 
Q: Your company has a reputation for delivering all kinds of consignments to customers? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Have you ever refused any shipment? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Your company is expert in transporting sensitive machinery, eg high precision equipment. 
 
A: Yes. But we appoint specialist sub-contractors for such high precision equipment. 
 
Q: What about general cargo? 
 
A: We always subcontract out. But we supervised.
  
 
 
Paragraph 5 of the first defendant`s amended defence also stated that `its servants or agents exercised due care as regards the concerned cargo`. In its further and better particulars given thereunder, the first defendant stated that it `provided adequate personnel who were properly supervised at the delivery site ...`. In line with the first defendant`s defence, Steven Ong in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief stated: 
 
I personally went down to oversee the delivery of the consignment and to ensure that everything proceed smoothly.
 
 
 
The first defendant`s pleadings and Steven Ong`s affidavit of evidence-in-chief were consistent with the first defendant having a contractual duty to take reasonable care of the machine. This included the duty to supervise the unloading operation. Notwithstanding this, Steven Ong, tried to distance himself from the unloading operation. This was what he said: 
 
 
Q: What did you do when the lorries arrived? 
 
A: I met the contractor, Mr Yap, Mr Chua and two workers. 
 
Q: They took instructions from you? 
 
A: No, from Azman Shah. 
 
Q: At what time did Azman Shah and Tony Wong appear? 
 
A: When the two trucks arrived, two men approached our trucks. They were Azman and Tony. 
 
Q: You did not give any instructions? 
 
A: That`s so. I told them to take instructions from Shah. 
 
Q: Was Azman present at the unloading bay throughout? 
 
A: He was there on and off. But when the bigger crate was being unloaded he was there giving instructions most of the time. 
 
Q: Was Tony Wong there as well? 
 
A: Not throughout the whole operation, at certain time only. 
 
Q: You are the expert and yet you had no part in the unloading leaving things to Azman Shah. Are you saying that? 
 
A: Yes. Because Azman and Tony were in Germany to see how their supplier packed the goods. So they knew how to lift the equipment. 
 
Q: Did you introduce the four workers to Azman and tell them to take instructions from Azman? 
 
A: Cannot remember.
  
 
 
Under cross-examination, Steven Ong was evasive in his answers. On no less than 30 occasions, his answers were either `cannot recall` or `cannot remember`. When he did give substantive answers, he was not forthcoming with the truth. See for example his evidence, when questioned as to whether he had reconnoitred the vicinity of the plaintiff`s factory to assess the accessibility of the equipment thereto: 
 
 
Q: If you have an order for shipment of goods, would you find out if the delivery requires special equipment, familiarise with the area to which the goods are to be delivered? 
 
A: Depends on the nature of the goods, the size of the goods. 
 
Q: See your para 3. You were told of two crates of machinery weighing 3.5 tons? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you see the need to reconnoitre the area? 
 
A: I was informed of the weight without the dimensions. So I did not see any need to do a reconnaissance. 
 
Q: Did you find out the size of the crates? 
 
A: I asked Alice Koh (PW1) about the dimension of the crates. She was not able to advise.
  
 
 
The truth came out only after further cross-examination: 
 
 
Q: You said before the delivery on 4.2.95 you did not reconnoitre plaintiffs` factory? 
 
A: Now I say I did reconnoitre the factory.""
  
 
 
Steven Ong was then asked if he took measurements of the lift, this was his evidence: 
 
 
Q: When you saw the lifts did you take measurements? 
 
A: Cannot recall. 
 
Q: Is it your practice to carry a measuring tape with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you did the reconnaissance, did you know the dimension of the cargo? 
 
A: Cannot remember. 
 
... 
 
Q: Put you also took measurements of the lift on the day of the reconnaissance? 
 
A: Cannot recall.
  
 
 
Under further cross-examination, this was what he said: 
 
 
Q: Upon collecting the consignment, did Danzas of Germany notify you of the size of the cargo? 
 
A: Yes, the dimension and weight. 
 
Q: So you realised the size of the cargo before its arrival? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you see the need to find out if the crated cargo could fit the lift servicing the plaintiffs? 
 
A: Yes. I knew one crate could not go into the lift. The one measuring 250 cm x 210 cm x 135 cm. 
 
Q: So what did you do? 
 
A: I presumed the width of 210 cm would not fit into the lift. 
 
Q: How did you know that? 
 
A: I presumed so. 
 
Q: Why did you [not] go and measure the lift? 
 
A: I went to measure the lift. 
 
Q: Are you sure? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
Having said that Ms Koh could not advise him of the dimension of the crates, he went on to say that she told him to uncrate the bigger crate `downstairs`, that is, at the loading bay: 
 
 
Q: Did you then go and inspect plaintiffs` factory? 
 
A: Ms Koh of plaintiffs instructed us that the bigger crate had to be uncrated. She advised that the crate be brought up to 3rd floor. We uncrated the big crate on the ground floor and carried the contents to the plaintiffs` factory. 
 
Q: You just said Ms Koh advised you to uncrate the bigger crate downstairs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did she tell you that? 
 
A: Cannot recall.
  
 
 
There were so many other instances of such unsatisfactory evidence coming from Steven Ong that I found him not a witness of truth. I will now deal with the evidence of Chua Cheng Huat and Yap Peng Huak.
It was quite clear that Steven Ong, Chua Cheng Huat and Yap Peng Huak had agreed to take a common stand that Azman took charge of the whole unloading operation with Steven Ong being a mere bystander. Azman was said to have shown them how to sling the belt around the X-Y unit for it to be lifted by the Hiap crane. See the evidence of Chua Cheng Huat: 
 
 
Q: After your lorry moved to the front bay, what happened? 
 
A: The front bay also had a shelter. So the crane could not operate under the shelter. So I parked my lorry with the rear facing the corridor. Azman told us to remove the canvas completely, to remove the four sides of the crate. Then he asked us to use the rope and showed us how to tie the ropes beneath the pellet. Then the Hiap crane lifted the cargo from my lorry onto the corridor. There were also four iron poles on four sides of the machine. (See BF/102.) Azman asked us to remove the chains which held the machine to the pellet. Azman showed us how to tie the machine in order to remove the machine. When we were removing the chain, the plastic sheet was still covering the machine. 
 
Q: While Azman was giving instructions, what was Steven Ong doing? 
 
A: Watching. He said nothing.
  
 
 
This was not consistent with his earlier evidence: 
 
 
Q: He [referring to Steven Ong] was supervising you? 
 
A: You can say that.
  
 
 
In their joint affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Chua Cheng Huat and Yap Peng Huak affirmed as follows: 
 
The second defendant was under a contract with the first defendants to deliver the cargoes in the first defendants` Changi Cargo Complex. The second defendant provides the lorries and manpower for the delivery. The first defendants usually give the delivery orders to the second defendants one day before the delivery date.
 
 
 
The second defendant was never engaged by the plaintiffs nor did he receive any orders from the plaintiffs to deliver the goods being the subject matter of the litigation to the plaintiffs` premises in Kallang Way.
 
 
 
The order to deliver the goods to the plaintiffs on the 4 February 1995 came from the first defendants in the usual course of business.
 
 
 
But in his eagerness to absolve themselves from blame for exposing the X-Y unit to rain by uncrating in the rain/drizzle, Chua Cheng Huat alleged that they received instructions from the plaintiff three days before delivery to uncrate the cargo. This evidence is all the more incredible when one bears in mind that the second defendant received the delivery order from the first defendant only one day before the delivery. The second defendant never dealt with the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not even aware that the first defendant had subcontracted the job to the second defendant. But this was what Chua Cheng Huat said: 
 
 
A: Before we received the DO from first defendants, we received instructions from plaintiffs to uncrate the cargo, otherwise how could the cargo be unloaded from the lorry. 
 
Q: If equipment could be loaded onto the lorry in a crate it could be unloaded in a crate? 
 
A: Cargo was 6 feet x 8 feet. Could not be unloaded onto the corridor. 
 
Q: When did you receive the D.O. from first defendants? 
 
A: One day before delivery date. 
 
Q: When did you receive instructions from plaintiffs to uncrate the cargo? 
 
A: Three days before delivery. 
 
Q: Who from plaintiffs gave you the instructions? 
 
A: I do not know. Somebody from first defendants received a fax from plaintiffs. 
 
Q: What does it say? 
 
A: The plaintiffs requested for Hiap crane, pellet jack and equipment to unload and uncrate the cargo. 
 
Q: The DO must be from first defendants? 
 
A: We were asked to comply with plaintiffs` instructions. 
 
Q: Were you to take instructions from plaintiffs on how to unload and how to transport to the office? 
 
A: Not for transporting to the office but uncrating. Yes.
  
 
 
In the case of Yap Peng Huak, when cross-examined on his joint affidavit of evidence-in-chief wherein he stated that Azman directed the unloading operation, this was what he said: 
 
 
Q: Throughout the unloading operation was there anyone from plaintiffs` company present? 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
Steven Ong, Chua Cheng Huat and Yap Peng Huak were all badly discredited. I therefore rejected their evidence that Azman took charge of the unloading operation in the process of which the X-Y unit was exposed to rain/drizzle and thereby sustained damage.
I will now deal with the exemption and limitation of liability cll 15 and 16 of the SAAA`s Standard Trading Conditions relied on by the defendants.
The transaction giving rise to these proceedings was the first dealing between the plaintiff and the first defendant. The incorporating clause appeared at the bottom of the first defendant`s faxed quotation of 17 January 1995 to the plaintiff following Steven Ong`s meeting with Ms Koh. It had not been brought to the attention of Ms Koh. It was in very small print and was not legible as admitted by Steven Ong: 
 
 
Q: See quotation at BF/122. Is that the one you faxed to plaintiffs or 1DB/2? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Please read the fine print at the bottom. 
 
A: All business transacted in accordance with SAAA`s Standard Trading Conditions, copy available on application`. 
 
Q: Is this an important clause? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: See 1DB/1. Put the print is very small? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: It`s not legible? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
As the local sector of the transportation of the machine would be subcontracted to the second defendant, the machine would not be in the `actual custody` of the first defendant. If cl 15 of SAAA`s Standard Trading Conditions was incorporated, the first defendant would not be liable to the plaintiff even for non-delivery by the second defendant. Under cl 16, if there was any liability, it was limited to $3,500 for the entire consignment with a value of DM497,000.
The incorporating clause read with the exemption and limitation of liability clauses therefore should have been brought to the attention of Ms Koh.
In 
Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd
 
[1989] QB 433
, the plaintiffs ran a photographic transparency lending library. Following a telephone inquiry by the defendants, the plaintiffs delivered to them 47 transparencies together with a delivery note containing nine printed conditions. Condition 2 stipulated that all the transparencies had to be returned within 14 days of delivery otherwise a holding fee of Â£5 a day and value added tax would be charged for each transparency retained thereafter. The defendants, who had not used the plaintiffs` services before, did not read the conditions and returned the transparencies four weeks later whereupon the plaintiffs invoiced the defendants for Â£3,783.50. The defendants refused to pay and the plaintiffs brought an action and obtained judgment for this sum in the county court. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal. In allowing the appeal Dillon LJ stated at p 436: 
 
There was never any oral discussion of terms between the parties before the contract was made. In particular there was no discussion whatever of terms in the original telephone conversation when Mr Beeching made his preliminary inquiry. The question is therefore whether condition 2 was sufficiently brought to the defendants` attention to make it a term of the contract which was only concluded after the defendants had received, and must have known that they had received the transparencies 
 and
 the delivery note.
 
 
 
This sort of question was posed, in relation to printed conditions, in the ticket cases, such as 
Parker v South Eastern Railway Co
 
[1877] 2 CPD 416
, in the last century. At that stage the printed conditions were looked at as a whole and the question considered by the courts was whether the printed conditions as a whole had been sufficiently dawn to a customer`s attention to make the whole set of conditions part of the contract; if so the customer was bound by the printed conditions even though he never read them.
 
 
 
More recently the question has been discussed whether it is enough to look at a set of printed conditions as a whole. When for instance one condition in a set is particularly onerous does something special need to be done to draw customers` attention to that particular condition? In an obiter dictum in J 
Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw
 
[1956] 1 WLR 461
, 466 (cited in 
 Chitty on Contracts
, 25th Ed (1983), vol 1, p 408) Denning LJ stated:
 
 
 
`Some clauses which I have seen would need to be printed in red ink on the face of the document with a red hand pointing to it before the notice could be held to be sufficient.`
 
 
 
Then in 
Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd
 
[1971] 2 QB 163
 both Lord Denning MR and Megaw LJ held as one of their grounds of decision, as I read their judgments, that where a condition is particularly onerous or unusual the party seeking to enforce it must show that that condition, or an unusual condition of that particular nature, was fairly brought to the notice of the other party. Lord Denning MR, at pp 169H-170D, re-stated and applied what he had said in the 
 Spurling
 case, and held that the court should not hold any man bound by such a condition unless it was drawn to his attention in the most explicit way. Megaw LJ deals with the point, at pp 172-173, where he said:
 
 
 
`In the present case what has to be sought in answer to the third question is whether the defendant company did what was reasonable fairly to bring to the notice of the plaintiff, at or before the time when the contract was made, the existence of this particular condition. This condition is that part of the clause - a few words embedded in a lengthy clause - which Lord Denning MR had read, by which, in the midst of provisions as to damage to property, the defendants sought to exempt themselves from liability for any personal injury suffered by the customer while he was on their premises. Be it noted that such a condition is one which involves the abrogation of the right given to a person such as the plaintiff by statute, the Occupiers` Liability Act 1957. True, it is open under that statute for the occupier of property by a contractual term to exclude that liability. In my view, however, before it can be said that a condition of that sort, restrictive of statutory rights, has been fairly brought to the notice of a party to a contract there must be some clear indication which would lead an ordinary sensible person to realise, at or before the time of making the contract, that a term of that sort, relating to personal injury, was sought to be included. I certainly would not accept that the position has been reached today in which it is to be assumed as a matter of general knowledge, custom, practice, or whatever is the phrase that is chosen to describe it, that when one is invited to go upon the property of another for such purposes as garaging a car, a contractual term is normally included that if one suffers any injury on those premises as a result of negligence on the part of the occupiers of the premises they shall not be liable.`
 
 
 
Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that 
Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd
 
[1971] 2 QB 613
 was a case of an exemption clause and that what their Lordship said must be read as limited to exemption clauses and in particular exemption clauses which would deprive the party on whom they are imposed of statutory rights. But what their Lordships said was said by way of interpretation and application of the general statement of the law by Mellish LJ in
 Parker v South Eastern Railway Co
 2 CPD 416, 423-424 and the logic of it is applicable to any particularly onerous clause in a printed set of conditions of the one contracting party which would not be generally known to the other party.
 
 
 
The first defendant having undertaken the assignment might delegate its performance to the second defendant but the first defendant could not delegate the contractual responsibility it owed the plaintiff.
In 
Metaalhandel JA Magnus BV v Ardfields Transport
 
[1988] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 197
, the plaintiffs were dealers in non-ferrous metals and scrap and were based in Amsterdam. On 12 January 1984, they purchased about 2 tons of thoriated tungsten rods packed in 12 sealed drums from sellers in Brighton. At that time the plaintiffs had no sub-sale in view and they wanted to store the goods in or near London. They sought quotations for the collection and storage of the goods from among others the first defendants (Ardfields) with whom they had done infrequent business in the past. In due course Ardfields` quotation was accepted. There followed an exchange of telexes which resulted in a contract whereby Ardfields undertook to transport the plaintiffs` goods from Brighton and store them at their warehouse in St Albans. On 25 January, Ardfields advised the plaintiffs by telex that as there was no space at the St Albans warehouse the drums would be placed at the warehouse of the second defendants, Jones Transport. Unknown to the plaintiffs and apparently unknown to Ardfields the goods were removed from Jones Transport`s warehouse on 8 August 1984 and could not be traced. The matter came to light only when the plaintiffs having arranged to sell part of the goods telexed Ardfields on 10 October 1984 asking them to quote for transporting them to another destination. In delivering his judgment, Gatehouse J stated at pp 202-203: 
 
It seems to me, on the authorities, that Ardfields were therefore never bailees. This affects the onus of proof but in the circumstances of this case that is immaterial. Ardfields` duty was to exercise reasonable care and skill in looking after the goods. They were entitled to delegate performance of the contract - either from the outset or as from the plaintiffs` waiver, when they accepted the breach (if there was one) -whereupon sub-contracting became authorized - but they were not able to delegate responsibility.
 
 
 
I was referred to several authorities and to 
 Palmer on Bailment
, where all those authorities are examined. In particular the text of 
 Palmer
, from pp 829-831, deals with the obligations to the bailor of the bailee who enters into an authorised sub-bailment. The better view, says the learned author, is that the bailee is liable for the negligence of the sub-bailee, citing 
BRS Ltd v Arthur Crutchley Ltd
 
[1968] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 271
[1968] 1 All ER 811
 and 
Morris v CW Martin & Sons Ltd
 
[1965] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 63
[1966] 1 QB 716
.
 
 
 
 
 Palmer
 then goes on to deal with the case of the `quasi-bailment` where the intermediate party is not a bailee because he never obtains actual possession of the goods. This was in fact the position in 
Edwards v Newland & Co
 
[1950] 2 KB 534
, where the intermediate party was nevertheless treated as a bailee because he had made an unauthorized sub-contract for the storage of the goods. At p 834 of the text, 
 Palmer
 turns to the position where the quasi-bailee enters into a sub-contract which he is authorized to do. That, it seems to me, is the position in the present case. 
 Palmer
 concludes that the position of the quasi-bailee is the same as that of a true bailee, namely, that he is answerable for the faults of his sub-contractor because, although he is entitled to delegate performance, he cannot delegate his responsibility.
 
 
 
Turning now to the second defendant, he could not rely on the said exemption and limitation of liability clauses even if they were applicable as between the first defendant and the plaintiff. This is because there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the second defendant. The plaintiff was not even aware that the first defendant would subcontract its assignment to the second defendant. The plaintiff`s claim against the second defendant was one based on breach of duty of care of a bailee to take reasonable care of the consignment in its custody.
In 
Morris v CW Martin & Sons Ltd
 
[1966] 1 QB 716
, the plaintiff sent a mink stole to a furrier to be cleaned. With the plaintiff`s consent, the furrier, who did no cleaning himself, delivered the fur to the defendants, who were well-known cleaners, to be cleaned. The contract between the furrier and the defendants, which was made by the furrier as principal and not as agent for the plaintiff, contained printed conditions of trading with exemption from liability clauses. Whilst the fur was with the defendants, it was stolen by one of their servants whose duty it was to clean the fur. The fur was never recovered. The plaintiff claimed damages against the defendants for breach of their duty to return the fur to her and to exercise reasonable care in its custody and, alternatively, for wrongfully depriving her of the fur. The county court judge found that the defendants had taken proper steps to safeguard the fur and were not negligent in employing the servant; and he held that the defendants were not liable because the act of the servant in stealing the fur was not done `in the scope of his employment`. The plaintiff`s appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed on the ground that the defendants, being sub-bailees for reward, owed to the plaintiff, the owner of the fur, the duties of a bailee for reward to take reasonable care of the fur and not to convert it. In delivering his judgment, Lord Denning MR stated at p 729: 
 
Now comes the question: Can the defendants rely, as against the plaintiff, on the exempting conditions although there was no contract directly between them and her? There is much to be said on each side. On the one hand, it is hard on the plaintiff if her just claim is defeated by exempting conditions of which she knew nothing and to which she was not a party. On the other hand, it is hard on the defendants if they are held liable to a greater responsibility than they agreed to undertake. As long ago as 1601 Lord Coke advised a bailee to stipulate specially that he would not be responsible for theft, see 
 Southcote`s
 case, 1601 4 Co Rep 83b, a case of theft by a servant. It would be strange if his stipulation was of no avail to him. The answer to the problem lies, I think, in this: the owner is bound by the conditions if he has expressly or impliedly consented to the bailee making a sub-bailment containing those conditions, but not otherwise.
 
 
 
 
 
 My decision 
 
 
 
 
 
As the defendants were liable for the damage to the X-Y unit and were not protected by cll 15 and 16 of the SAAA`s Standard Trading Conditions, I entered judgment for the plaintiff for S$218,143.27 being costs of the replacement inclusive of installation less the salvaged value of the damaged X-Y unit. I also awarded the plaintiff interest on the award at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of service of the Writ and costs. I disallowed the claim for $7,671.00 being adjuster`s fees paid by the plaintiff`s insurers on the ground that it was not an item of loss sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the defendants` breach of duty. Therefore, the plaintiff`s insurers who were prosecuting this claim in the name of the plaintiff could not obtain recovery of this item by way of subrogation.

: The defendant Robert Piano Co Pte Ltd (`Robert Piano`) is a company incorporated in Singapore. It deals in pianos. Its business includes the teaching of music which it provides in its six music schools. The managing director Mr Robert Chiu trained as a piano technician and worked in his father`s piano business from 1957. He established his own piano business in 1966 and in 1978 he incorporated Robert Piano to continue the business. He said under cross-examination that Robert Piano was one of the largest sellers of pianos in Singapore.
The plaintiff Cristofori Music Pte Ltd (`Cristofori Music`) was incorporated in 1980. It also deals in pianos and it also provides teaching of music. Cristofori Music and Robert Piano sell pianos of different makes. Notably Cristofori Music is the sole distributor of Asahi and Paco pianos and Robert Piano is the sole distributor of the higher priced Kawai and Samick pianos. Cristofori Music is today one of the largest sellers of pianos and this has affected Robert Piano`s market share as Mr Robert Chiu admitted in evidence.
The Straits Times newspaper of 1 February 1997 carried on its front page an advertisement of Kawai and Samick pianos. The advertisement contained the following statement printed conspicuously: 
 
BEWARE! Pianos, like `A` & `P` brands (retailing at $3799 & $4970 respectively, as advertised) are made & assembled in Pyongyang, North Korea. Both brands are made in the same factory and claim to use mainly Japanese parts when in actual fact 80% to 90% of these piano parts are made in North Korea by North Korean workmen. These pianos are therefore 100% made & assembled in Pyongyang, North Korea, NOT JAPAN!!! Isn`t this a `Sales Gimmick`? Do not let such sales people `PULL WOOL OVER YOUR EYES`! Insist on written statement for your own protection! The Old Chinese Proverb `ONE CENT BUYS YOU ONE CENT PRODUCT` does apply here. Therefore such pianos cannot be compared with world re-nowned KAWAI & SAMICK Pianos - The Two Names You Can Trust!
 
 
 
The advertisement appears on the face of it to have been published by Robert Piano.
On 5 February 1997 Cristofori Music`s solicitors wrote to Robert Piano. They alleged that the statement in the advertisement referred to Cristofori Music and that it was defamatory. They demanded an undertaking not to repeat the advertisement and the usual actions to be taken and threatened legal proceedings in default. No such undertaking was given but since then no advertisement has appeared containing the statement complained of or words to the same effect. It is not disputed that the advertisement was published by Robert Piano and Mr Robert Chiu said that he stopped publishing such advertisements on legal advice.
This action was commenced by writ issued on 15 February 1997. A statement of claim was filed with the writ. Robert Piano filed a defence and counterclaim. The counterclaim relates to an alleged libel contained in a letter dated 31 January 1997 from Cristofori Music to one of its customers. Cristofori Music filed a reply and defence to the counterclaim. At the conclusion of the trial I found for Cristofori Music on its claim and gave judgment for $50,000 damages and granted an injunction. On the counterclaim I found for Robert Piano and gave judgment for $5,000 damages. Robert Piano has given notice of appeal and these are my written grounds of judgment.
Paragraph 9 of the statement of claim states: 
 
The plaintiffs aver that the words in the defendants` advertisement referred to and was understood to refer to the plaintiffs and/or the plaintiffs` pianos.
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
 
(a) Paragraphs 1 and 7 above are repeated. 
 
(b) The plaintiffs` pianos have been widely advertised, and in particular the plaintiffs had on 1 January 1997 advertised in 
 The Straits Times 
 that the price for their `Asahi` piano is $3799 and the price for their `Paco` piano is $4970. The said advertisement is set out in Sch 2 of this statement of claim. 
 
(c) That there are no other brands of pianos beginning with the alphabets `A` and `P` that are made in North Korea and further, `Asahi` and `Paco` pianos are solely distributed by the plaintiffs.
  
 
 
Paragraph 1 describes Cristofori Music and para 7 sets out the text of the statement complained of.
Paragraph 6 of the defence states: 
 
The defendants deny para 9 of the statement of claim and put the plaintiffs to strict proof thereof.
 
 
 
 
 
 Asahi 
 
 
 
 Paco 
 
This is clearly an insufficient traverse of the allegations of fact made in para 9 of the statement of claim. See O 18 r 13(3). It is a matter of regret that such general denials have become quite common. Counsel explained that it was Robert Piano`s case that there was no evidence to support identification. I understand him to say that Robert Piano denies that the statement complained of referred to Cristofori Music. As for the particulars in para 9 of the statement of claim Robert Piano admits: 
(a) that Cristofori Music was at all material times the sole distributor of and pianos (as alleged in para 1 of the statement of claim); and 
(b) that the advertisement in the Straits Times newspaper of 1 February 1997 contained the statement complained of (as alleged in para 7 of the statement of claim).
It further: 
(c) concedes that there is evidence to support the allegations contained in para (b) of the particulars; and 
(d) admits the allegations contained in para (c) of the particulars.
In 
E Hulton & Co v Jones
 
[1910] AC 20
 defamatory statements were published of a person identified by an unusual name and the publishers believed this to be a fictitious person. In fact it was the real name of the plaintiff. Lord Loreburn LC said at p 23: 
 
Libel is a tortious act. What does the tort consist in? It consists in using language which others knowing the circumstances would reasonably think to be defamatory of the person complaining of and injured by it.
 
 
 
The trial judge had directed the jury: 
 
The real point upon which your verdict must turn is, ought or ought not sensible and reasonable people reading this article to think that it was a mere imaginary person ... ? If you think any reasonable person would think that, it is not actionable at all. If, on the other hand, you do not think that, but think that people would suppose it to mean some real person - those who did not know the plaintiff of course would not know who the real person was, but those who did know of the existence of the plaintiff would think that it was the plaintiff - then the action is maintainable ...`
 
 
 
Lord Loreburn LC said at p 24 that he saw no objection in law to that passage in the direction to the jury.
In 
Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd
 
[1944] AC 116
 Viscount Simon LC said at p 118: 
 
... it is an essential element of the cause of action for defamation that the words complained of should be published `of the plaintiff`.
 
 
 
and later at p 119: 
 
Where the plaintiff is not named, the test which decides whether the words used refer to him is the question whether the words are such as would reasonably lead persons acquainted with the plaintiff to believe that he was the person referred to.
 
 
 
Lord Atkin put it this way at p 121: 
 
The only relevant rule is that in order to be actionable the defamatory words must be understood to be published of and concerning the plaintiff.

.
Cristofori Music is not named in the statement complained of or anywhere in the advertisement containing it. In order to be actionable the statement must be understood to be published of and concerning Cristofori Music. I would respectfully apply Viscount Simon LC`s test and ask the question whether the words in the statement are such as would reasonably lead persons acquainted with Cristofori Music to believe that it was the person referred to.
In the 
 Knupffer 
 case Viscount Simon LC went on to say at p 121: 
 
There are two questions involved in the attempt to identify the appellant as the person defamed. The first question is a question of law - can the article, having regard to its language, be regarded as capable of referring to the appellant? The second question is a question of fact - Does the article, in fact, lead reasonable people, who know the appellant, to the conclusion that it does refer to him? Unless the first question can be answered in favour of the appellant, the second question does not arise ...
 
 
 
The statement in the advertisement does not merely refer to piano dealers who use `sales gimmick` or `pull wool over [the buyer`s] eyes`. It refers to a particular dealer. It refers to `Pianos, like ""A"" and ""P"" brands (retailing at $3799 & $4970 respectively, as advertised)`. There are references to their being assembled in North Korea and to the use of Japanese parts. I think the statement is capable of referring to Cristofori Music. What remains to be proved is that the statement in fact did lead reasonable people who knew Cristofori Music to the conclusion that it referred to this company. Surprisingly Cristofori Music itself adduced no evidence in this regard. It seemed content to rely on the witnesses called by Robert Piano to testify.
Ms Edna Chia is a piano teacher with more than 30 years` experience. She said in her affidavit that she was often asked by students and friends to recommend pianos to them. She recalled an occasion in 1986 when she accompanied her student`s parents to Cristofori Music`s showroom to look at a 
 Dresden 
 piano that they were thinking of buying. She would have known of Cristofori Music for a good number of years since then and Cristofori Music is now one of the largest sellers of pianos.
In December 1996 Ms Chia saw an advertisement placed by Robert Piano in a newspaper. It contained this statement in the form of a questionnaire: 
 
`BEWARE! Make a CHECK LIST on the following points before you buy your piano:
 
 
 
 
(1) Where is the cast iron frame / (2) sound board / (3) piano casing made and by whom? Japan / N Korea / Another Country; 
 
(4) Who are the craftsmen who make the piano bridge / (5) install the piano action into the piano / (6) in which country the pianos are originally made and assembled and (7) where is the final inspection done? Japan / N Korea / Another Country;
  
 
 
If only one or two of the answers is Japan, then `A`, `P`, `G`, `Y` etc brands cannot claim that their pianos use 90% Japanese parts or of Japanese quality, craftsmenship and origin.
 
 
 
She said she thought this was a good guide and she proceeded to make some telephone calls to make inquiries `for [her] own information` as she said. She first called a dealer of a well known Japanese piano and she said she was satisfied with the answers she received. Her next call was to Cristofori Music. She was recommended a Paco piano and she asked a number of questions about it. Under cross-examination she was not asked what made her call Cristofori Music or why she made the inquiries `for [her] own information`. Ms Chia is a part time teacher with Kawai Music School and it was subsequently revealed that Kawai Music School is owned by Robert Piano.
Under cross-examination Ms Chia admitted that by January 1997 she had heard of Asahi and Paco pianos. She said: 
 
 
Q: To recommend you have to know various brands in market? 
 
A: Not all brands in market. 
 
Q: How would you know brands available? 
 
A: From piano shops. Sometimes brochures, flyers sent through mail and I guess newspaper advertisements if I came across them. 
 
Q: Came across Kawai advertisement in newspaper? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Asahi advertisement in newspaper? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Paco advertisement in newspaper? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
and later: 
 
 
Q: Wong (1). Page 87. Asahi. Paco. Likely came across advertisement 1/1/97? 
 
(Note: This is Cristofori Music`s advertisement published on 1/1/97.) 
 
A: May or may not. Don`t read newspaper for advertisements. Read for articles. If advertisement happens to be next to article I read I might notice. I won`t study it. 
 
Q: If you have read would have seen price next to Asahi? 
 
A: Would have seen it but would not have studied advertisement. 
 
Q: Paco. Would have seen price `$4,970` stated there? 
 
A: Same. Would have but would not have studied advertisement. 
 
Q: Wong (1). Page 87. If you read this would have seen `Cristofori Music`? 
 
A: If I read through whole I would. If only cursory glance might not. 
 
Q: Heard of Cristofori Music Pte Ltd? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: January 1997. You knew Cristofori Music Pte Ltd distributor of Asahi piano in Singapore? 
 
A: Would know it sells but whether distributor would not know. 
 
Q: January 1997. You knew Cristofori Music Pte Ltd company that sells Paco piano? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
Ms Chia knew by January 1997 that Cristofori Music sells Asahi and Paco pianos.
Cristofori Music`s advertisement published in 
 The Straits Times 
 newspaper of 1 January 1997 carried the heading `Welcome 1997` and offered a number of makes of pianos at special prices. Asahi piano was offered at $3,799 and was described as: 
 
100% designed by Japanese & using mainly high quality Japanese precision parts (NO PLASTIC PARTS).
 
 
 
Paco piano was offered at $4,970 and was described as: 
 
 
The most beautiful, most elegant handcrafted piano by craftsmen with more than 35 years of experience in handcrafted pianos based on German `Meister` craftmanship.
  
 
 
By January 1997 Ms Chia knew from advertisements that Paco pianos were made in North Korea. She said that under cross-examination. She said it was possible she would have seen advertisements of Asahi pianos offering them for sale at $3,799 and describing them as `assembled in the Japanese Joint Venture factory in Pyongyang, North Korea.` In December 1996 she made inquiries of Cristofori Music and asked a number of questions about the Paco piano. She made the inquiries `for [her] own information` and would have given Cristofori Music`s advertisement of 1 January 1997 more than a mere `cursory glance` if she had seen it or been referred to it. The advertisement appeared so soon after her inquiries.
By January 1997 Ms Chia knew that Asahi and Paco pianos were sold by Cristofori Music as she admitted and she knew of no other dealer that sold such pianos. I think she knew by then that Paco pianos were offered at $4,970 or some such price and were made in North Korea and Asahi pianos were offered at $3,799 or some such price and were also made in North Korea. The offer prices for these pianos in Cristofori Music`s advertisement of 1 January 1997 would have caught her attention.
Ms Chia said in her affidavit that she had seen Robert Piano`s advertisement of 1 February 1997. She said: 
 
I have seen the defendants` advertisement dated 1 February 1997. As a piano teacher, the brand names, `Asahi` and `Paco` did not come to mind when I read the said advertisement. In fact, I know of a few other brand names beginning with the letters A and P, for example, `Atlas`, `Ajello`, `Apollo`, `Ashton`, `Pleyel` and `Petrof`. Even with the reference to the prices of the `A` and `P` pianos referred to in the advertisement, I did not know that it refer to the plaintiffs` pianos.`
 
 
 
I find this quite unbelievable.
Under cross-examination Ms Chia said she had no idea where Atlas was made. It was sold `quite some time ago` but she did not know if it was still sold in Singapore. She thought Ajello was made in Italy but she did not know if it was sold in Singapore. She was not sure if Apollo was sold in Singapore and she had an idea it was made in Japan. She did not know if Ashton was sold in Singapore and she thought it was made in Europe. She also did not know if Pleyel was sold in Singapore and also thought it was made in Europe. She knew that Petrof was sold in Singapore and she knew that it was made in the Czech Republic. She said she did not know how much a Petrof upright sold for. Rather more than the $4,970 for the Paco I should have thought and as she must have known as a piano teacher of her experience. She said that when she saw Robert Piano`s advertisment she did not think `A` and `P` referred to any particular brands of piano but she explained to the court that `A` and `P` meant two brands of piano to her.
Ms Chia saw Robert Piano`s advertisement of 1 February 1997 and in particular the statement contained in it which is complained of. I think she knew that `""A"" retailing at $3,799 and ""P"" retailing at $4,970 as advertised` were references to Asahi and 
 Paco 
 pianos. She knew that they were made or assembled in North Korea. She knew that Asahi and Paco pianos were sold by Cristofori Music and that Cristofori Music had advertised them for sale at those prices. I think she knew from the statement and what she knew about this company that the statement referred to Cristofori Music.
Mr Chiu Lu Bing is the general manager of Singapore Piano Co Pte Ltd. He said in his affidavit that he had been in the business of selling pianos for 15 years and his family for more than 40 years. He said he had been shown a copy of Robert Piano`s advertisement and continued in his affidavit: 
 
Firstly, it is not immediately apparent from the defendants` advertisement which pianos the defendants are referring to by using the initials `A` and `P`. Being in the business of selling pianos myself, there are several brand names which begin with these letters which spring to mind ...
 
 
 
Secondly, even if I were able to identify from the defendants` advertisement that the defendants are referring to the Asahi and Paco brands, I would not be able to immediately connect the said brand names to the plaintiffs.
 
 
 
He named six brands beginning with `A` and three brands beginning with `P`. Under cross-examination he admitted that Cristofori Music was his business competitor and in January 1997 he knew that Cristofori Music sold Asahi and Paco pianos.
Under cross-examination Mr Chiu said: 
 
 
Q: As businessman you would be interested in knowing what brands of piano your competitor selling? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Also interested in knowing what price competitor selling this piano? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Wong (1). Page 87. Likely you saw this on or shortly after 1/1/97? 
 
A: Would be likely I had cursory glance at most advertisements. 
 
(To court):Advertisement on 1/1/97. Could have glanced at it next day. 
 
Q: Glanced at it. Came across `Asahi`? 
 
A: If I took longer look, yes. 
 
Q: Would also have seen `Offer $3,799`? 
 
A: Generally would have cursory glance at prices. 
 
Q: Would also have seen `Paco`? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Would also have seen price `$4,970`? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Would also have seen `Cristofori Music`? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
Under further cross-examination he said: 
 
 
Q: January 1997. Who main advertisers for piano in Straits Times other than in classified advertisements? 
 
A: Think on frequency Yamaha, Cristofori, Kawai. 
 
Q: Many advertisements? By these 3? 
 
A: These 3 and others. 
 
(To court): Think have seen advertisements of Bohemia which are fairly frequent. No others I can remember now. 
 
Q: January 1997. Frequency you recall of plaintiff`s advertisement? 
 
A: Would not recall in January 1997. 
 
Q: Kawai? January 1997? 
 
A: Don`t know. 
 
Q: Would say everyday? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: 2 or 3 times per week? 
 
A: Can say would have seen several times over the year for Yamaha, Kawai, Cristofori, Gramercy. I left this out earlier.`
  
 
 
Mr Chiu would have looked at piano advertisements. He knew that Cristofori Music was one of four main advertisers in 
 The Straits Times 
 newspaper on the basis of frequency. He could say he had seen their advertisements several times over the year. I think he would have seen Cristofori Music`s advertisement of 1 January 1997 and he would have seen that Asahi and Paco pianos were offered at $3,799 and $4,970. He knew of several makes with names beginning with `A` and `P` other than Asahi and Paco but as he admitted in cross-examination he also knew that none of these was made in North Korea. He admitted to the court: 
 
Has entered my mind referred to Asahi and Paco. After looking at advertisement once again. Can`t remember possibly when.
 
 
 
I think Mr Chiu knew from the statement complained of in Robert Piano`s advertisement of 1 February 1997 and from what he knew about Cristofori Music that the statement referred to it.
Both Ms Chia and Mr Chiu know Cristofori Music. They have read the statement complained of in Robert Piano`s advertisement. They know that `A` and `P` refer to Asahi and Paco pianos. They know the statement refers to Cristofori Music and it has not been suggested that I should not regard them as reasonable people. In my judgment the words in the statement complained of were published of Cristofori Music.
Paragraph 10 of the statement of claim states: 
 
In their natural and ordinary meaning, the words in the defendants` advertisement as referred to in paras 5 and 7 herein meant and were understood to mean:
 
 
 
 
(i) The plaintiffs are dangerous and a threat to society and the public at large. 
 
(ii) The plaintiffs` advertisement and sales tactics will entrap members of the public if they fail to exercise caution. 
 
(iii) The plaintiffs are dishonest in claiming that their pianos use mainly Japanese parts. 
 
(iv) The plaintiffs are dishonest and practise lowly sales tactics. 
 
(v) The plaintiffs have dishonestly employed unscrupulous and lowly sales tactics to boost their sales. 
 
(vi) The plaintiffs are tricksters who are capable of deceiving the public. 
 
(vii) The plaintiffs have through wilful misrepresentation tried to trick and deceive their customers and other members of the public into buying their pianos. 
 
(viii) The plaintiffs` treacherous and conniving conduct had exposed the public to risk. 
 
(ix) The plaintiffs are guilty of undesirable and unlawful acts which if left unguarded will result in harm in the public. 
 
(x) The plaintiffs sell cheap products with suspect qualities and are therefore a dubious and mediocre company. 
 
(xi) The plaintiffs` relatively lesser priced pianos must surely have suspect qualities and are less reliable. 
 
(xii) The plaintiffs are crooked and cannot be trusted since the pianos sold by them are dubious products that cannot be trusted.
  
 
 
Robert Piano denies that the words in the statement bear or are capable of being understood to bear any of these meanings.
In 
Rubber Improvement Ltd & Anor v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1964] AC 234
 Lord Reid said at p 258: 
 
There is no doubt that in actions for libel the question is what the words would convey to the ordinary man: it is not one of construction in the legal sense. The ordinary man does not live in an ivory tower and he is not inhibited by a knowledge of the rules of construction. So he can and does read between the lines in the light of his general knowledge and experience of world affairs ...
 
 
 
What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning.
 
 
 
I turn now to the meanings which Cristofori Music ascribe to the words in the statement complained of: 
 
The plaintiffs are dishonest in claiming that their pianos use mainly Japanese parts.
 
 
 
The second sentence in the statement says that a false claim has been made. I think to the ordinary person reading this statement as a whole and this sentence in particular the meaning conveyed by Robert Piano`s advertisement is that Cristofori Music is dishonest in claiming that Asahi and Paco pianos use mainly Japanese parts. 
 
The plaintiffs have through wilful misrepresentation tried to trick and deceive their customers and other members of the public into buying their pianos.
 
 
 
The statement plainly says that. Facts have been misrepresented. Pianos with 80% to 90% of their parts made in North Korea have been claimed to use mainly Japanese parts. I think the ordinary person will infer that the false claim has been made to sell Asahi and Paco pianos. I think that reading the statement he will understand it to mean that Cristofori Music has tried to deceive its customers and others into buying its pianos by wilfully representing the pianos as using mainly Japanese parts when in fact they did not.
I have considered all the other meanings alleged (and there are ten of them) and I think it is sufficient for me to say that these other meanings are too far fetched. After reviewing the authorities Lord Reid said in the 
 Rubber Improvement Ltd 
 case at p 259: 
 
In this case it is, I think, sufficient to put the test in this way. Ordinary men and women have different temperaments and outlooks. Some are unusually suspicious and some are unusually naive. One must try to envisage people between these two extremes and see what is the most damaging meaning they would put on the words in question.
 
 
 
In the case before me `suspicious` may not be the appropriate word but I would say that the reader of the statement complained of would have to read too much into it to understand the words to bear any of these ten meanings.
Paragraph 7A of the defence states: 
 
Further or in the alternative, insofar as the words were understood to bear the meanings set out below, they are true.
 
 
 
Particulars of Meanings
 
 
 
At best, the words mean that the brands `A` and `P` were made and assembled in North Korea using substantially 80% to 90% North Korean pianos parts (as opposed to generic parts) and that buyers should be aware of clever advertising and clever salesmanship and therefore ask for a written statement of the origin of the pianos and note that you get is what you pay for.
 
 
 
Robert Piano`s suggested meaning omits altogether the claim as regards the use of mainly Japanese parts and introduces the word `substantially` and seeks to distinguish `parts` from `generic parts`. I do not think an ordinary person would understand the statement in this way. In my judgment the words in the statement are not capable of bearing this meaning.
In 
Sim v Stretch
 
[1936] 2 All ER 1237
 Lord Atkin said at p 1240: 
 
... after collating the opinions of many authorities I propose in the present case the test: would the words tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally?
 
 
 
He was proposing a test of whether words are defamatory or not. See 
Aaron & Ors v Cheong Yip Seng & Ors
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 623
  at p 641 where Lord Atkin`s test was applied. The two meanings I have found impute dishonesty and deception. In my judgment the statement complained of tends to lower Cristofori Music in the estimation of right thinking members of society generally. The statement is defamatory of Cristofori Music.
Paragraph 8 of the defence states: 
 
Further or in the alternative, the defendants say that the words set out in paras 5 and 7 of the statement of claim are true in substance and in fact.
 
 
 
Nine paragraphs of particulars are given but only para (c) is relevant: 
 
Save for a small fraction of minor parts which are of Japanese origin and are yet to be assembled to be a complete piano part, the bridge pin, tuning pin, tuning pin bush, hammer head, butt spring and pedal fulcrum pins, the rest of the piano parts are made in North Korea and are not Japanese piano parts as claimed.
 
 
 
Mr Keisuke Ohtani is the chief piano engineer of PACO Co Ltd of Japan. He said in his affidavit that his company is a `100% Japanese company` and the company is the manufacturer of Cristofori Music`s 
 Asahi 
 and 
 Paco 
 pianos. These pianos are `100% designed by Japanese piano engineers` and are `assembled in PACO`s joint-venture piano factory in Pyongyang, North Korea, under the supervision of [PACO`s] Japanese piano engineers`.
Mr Ohtani said in his affidavit: 
 
Most of the important components of the plaintiffs` piano are made in Japan. In fact, `Paco` pianos use mainly Japanese parts selected and controlled by PACO in Japan. A copy of the drawings of the piano parts can be found at pages 5 to 15 of `KO-1`. Those which have a circle in the column marked `parts from Japan` are the parts which are made in Japan. Those parts which are marked with a circle in the column `North Korean parts` are the parts that are made in North Korea. Details of Part Origin can be found at pages 16 to 18 of `KO-1`. Out of the 8,500 pieces of piano components, around 1,500 pieces are made in North Korea.
 
 
 
Under cross-examination he said: 
 
 
Q: Your company sells Paco pianos in Japan? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Asahi? Your company sells in Japan? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Reason why not? 
 
A: Nothing in particular. We have other brands. Only designate name Asahi only for export. Basic design same for Paco and Asahi but we give different name.
  
 
 
I think what he has said about the Paco piano parts applies substantially to the Asahi piano. It is not disputed that both Asahi and Paco pianos are made or assembled in the same factory in North Korea. Mr Ohtani`s evidence is that Asahi pianos as well as Paco pianos use mainly Japanese parts selected and controlled by PACO in Japan.
Under cross-examination Mr Ohtani said that he considered the soundboard, the strings and the hammer the three most important parts of a piano. He said: 
 
 
Q: Soundboard for Paco piano. Comes from Japan? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You export wood to North Korea to make soundboard? 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
He has included the soundboard among the approximately 1,500 parts made in North Korea. It is not a `Japanese part`.
In relation to the strings Mr Ohtani said: 
 
 
Q: Piano strings. Sent from Japan to North Korea. In what form? 
 
A: Strings long. Coiled and wrapped in protective material to prevent rusting. Packed. 
 
Q: Length of strings in coil? 
 
A: Don`t know. Different types have different diameters. 
 
Q: Have to be cut to length in North Korea? 
 
A: Yes. Cut to correct length to get correct pitch. 
 
Q: Strings for lower notes. Coiled with thinner wire? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Coiling done in North Korea? 
 
A: Yes. Thinner wire also sent from Japan. Copper wire.
  
 
 
He has included the music wires for the strings and the copper wires as parts made in Japan.
In relation to the hammer Mr Ohtani said: 
 
 
Q: Felt parts. Shipped from Japan to North Korea in rolls? 
 
A: Cut in Japan and shipped to North Korea. Cutting most important part. 
 
Q: Ohtani (1). Page 233. `HF 1 (carton)`. Item 32. Each piece cut in Japan and sent to North Korea? 
 
(Note: This is a felt item.) 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Item 44. Item cut to size in Japan or North Korea? 
 
(Note: This is an item called the `butt skin`.) 
 
A: Cut in North Korea. 
 
Q: How many pieces used in piano? Butt skin? 
 
A: 88 pieces. 
 
Q: When cut. You include as parts made in Japan? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Ohtani (1). Para 8. Sentence 7. 1,500 pieces. Include pieces cut to size in North Korea? 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
Dictionary meanings of the word `parts` were suggested by counsel in their submissions but while such meanings are no doubt relevant I think any assistance I can derive from them is really quite limited. The word has to be understood by the ordinary reader of the statement complained of and it has to be understood in its context. I think the ordinary reader would understand `part` as a part of the finished product rather than as something that can be fashioned into the finished product or a part of the finished product. As an illustration: he would not see a piece of timber as a part of a chair but he would in his mind take the chair apart and identify say the legs as some of its parts. I think that in the context of the statement `parts` would connote to the ordinary reader a meaning and a sense derived by this mental process even if he is not conscious of the way his mind is working.
Piano strings are of two kinds. Some are bare and others are sheathed in tightly wound thin copper wire. The sheathed strings are for the lower notes and are less in number. I think the ordinary reader would see each of the bare strings or music wires as a part. He would also see each of the sheathed strings as a part. This string can be unsheathed to expose a bare string or music wire and to yield the thin copper wire. I think the ordinary reader would also see each of such music wires and the thin copper wires as parts. All these music wires and the thin copper wires are cut to length in North Korea from coils of wire made in and shipped from Japan.
The second sentence of the statement refers to a claim to use `mainly Japanese parts` and says that 80% to 90% of `these piano parts` are made in North Korea. I think the ordinary reader would understand `parts` in both sections of this sentence in the same sense whether called `parts` or `piano parts`. I think he would understand the bare music wires and thin copper wires as Japanese parts if they are made in Japan even if they are cut to length in North Korea. By the same token he would not understand the music wires or the thin copper wires to be made in North Korea just because they are cut to length in North Korea. I think more than merely cutting to length would be required for him to understand these wires as `
 made 
 in North Korea`. Mr Ohtani has included each of these music wires and thin copper wires as Japanese parts. I agree that these are `Japanese parts` and are not `piano parts made in North Korea`.
In the hammer group of parts Mr Ohtani said that the felt parts were cut in Japan and that cutting was the most important part. He included these felt parts as Japanese parts. I think these are clearly `Japanese parts` and not `piano parts made in North Korea`.
Mr Ohtani also included 88 pieces of butt skin as Japanese parts. These are cut in North Korea from skins shipped from Japan. He was not asked what was involved in cutting and what he said was not altogether very helpful. Item 44 of HF 1 at p 233 of his affidavit indicates that they are cut from larger pieces and presumably have to be cut to fit the hammer butt. While merely cutting a music wire to the required length in North Korea would not make it a part made in North Korea I would think that an ordinary reader of the statement looking at a butt skin taken from a piano and being told that it had been cut into that particular size and shape in North Korea to fit the hammer butt of the piano would probably regard it as a `piano part made in North Korea`. I think the butt skins are not `Japanese parts`. I think they are `piano parts made in North Korea`.
Mr Ohtani also said under cross-exmination: 
 
 
Q: Cabinet. Ohtani (1). Page 154. Cabinet comes in parts assembled in North Korea? 
 
A: Case comes from Japan, finished by painting and assembled. Cabinet made of about 23 pieces. Each is cut into correct shape in North Korea. 
 
Q: These 23 parts. Included in 1,500 pieces in Ohtani (1) para 8 sentence 7? 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
At p 165 of his affidavit the 23 parts of the cabinet appear to be shown as North Korean parts. They must have been included in the approximately 1,500 pieces which he said in his affidavit are made in North Korea. I think he was mistaken under cross-examination but he was not re-examined. These 23 parts will have to be included as parts made in North Korea and added to the approximate number of 1,500.
Mr Ohtani has identified about 1,500 parts as being North Korean parts. To that number must be added the 88 butt skin parts and the 23 cabinet parts but it does not make any significant difference. Of the 8,500 parts of a PACO piano made or assembled in North Korea only about 1,611 of them or about 19% are made in North Korea. The rest are Japanese parts.
Mr Robert Chiu said in his affidavit: 
 
... the defendants` advertisement states that 80% to 90% of the piano parts of the `A` & `P` brands are made in North Korea by North Korean workmen and 100% assembled in Pyongyang, North Korea, all of which are also true.
 
 
 
He went on to say: 
 
Annexed hereto and marked as exh `CNYR-7` is a breakdown of the important parts of a piano from which, it is to be noted that the major parts of the piano namely, the back post, the iron frame, the soundboard and soundboard bridge, pedal assembly, and the casing amount to at least 80% of the major parts of a piano.
 
 
 
Exhibit CNYR-7 is headed `Breakdown of Major Piano Parts` and lists 14 groups of parts. Under cross-examination he explained that `important parts` meant `major parts` and under re-examination he corrected himself and removed item 13 of the 14 groups leaving 13 groups altogether.
I find this statement about the major parts of a piano quite outrageous. His evidence if that is what it can be called is that the major parts of a piano amount to at least 80% of the major parts of a piano! Under cross-examination he explained: 
 
What I mean is 6 items I have named, namely, (1) back post, (2) iron frame, (3) soundboard, (4) soundboard bridge, (5) pedal assembly; and (6) casing - amount to 80% of piano.
 
 
 
He then went on to say: 
 
 
Q: Six items. 80% of piano. 80% of all parts of piano? 
 
A: Yes. 80% of all parts of piano. Not 80% by number.
  
 
 
It would not be 80% by number. From Mr Ohtani`s `Details of Parts Origin` these six items account for 48 parts only by number. It would also not be by number of groups of what Mr Robert Chiu calls major parts.
The six items are six of the 13 groups of piano parts listed in exhibit CNYR-7 and if these six items amount to 80% of all parts of a piano but not 80% by number then by what measure I am unable to imagine. Mr Robert Chiu did not say. I must return to the ordinary person reading the statement complained of. What would he understand `80% to 90% of these piano parts` in the context to mean? I do not think that he will read it as 80% to 90% of the major parts nor will he read the claim to relate to `mainly Japanese 
 major 
 parts`. He will not read it as `80% to 90% of the piano parts but not 80% to 90% by number`. I think he will read `parts` or `piano parts` as all parts of a piano and he will understand `80% to 90% of the piano parts` to mean 80% to 90% of the piano parts by number.
In my judgment the defence of justification has not been made out. It is not true that 80% to 90% of the parts or piano parts of an 
 Asahi 
 or 
 Paco 
 piano are made in North Korea. It is not true that only a small fraction of `minor parts` are of Japanese origin.
Robert Piano pleads s 8 of the Defamation Act which provides: 
 
In an action for libel or slander in respect of words containing two or more distinct charges against the plaintiff, a defence of justification shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the words not proved to be true do not materially injure the plaintiff`s reputation having regard to the truth of the remaining charges.
 
 
 
The sting of the charge made against Cristofori Music lies in the fact asserted by Robert Piano that 80% to 90% of the piano parts are made in North Korea. I have found that this is untrue. In any case there are no two or more distinct charges against Cristofori Music. In my judgment s 8 of the Defamation Act does not assist Robert Piano in its defence of justification.
Paragraph 11 of the defence states: 
 
Further or in the alternative, the words set out in paras 5 and 7 of the statement of claim are fair comment upon a matter of public interest, namely, that the public/consumers are being misled by statements in the advertisements placed by the plaintiffs to entice them to buy the plaintiffs` pianos and upon the following facts.
 
 
 
Particulars of facts and matters which the comment was based
 
 
 
The defendants repeat parahs 8(a) to 8(h) above.
 
 
 
I very much doubt that Robert Piano is saying that every part of the statement complained of is `comment` for the purpose of the defence but it is clear that the second sentence in the statement contains three assertions of fact and in the context of the statement these are not and are incapable of being understood as comments: 
(a) Both Asahi and Paco pianos are made in the same factory. This is fact and not comment and this fact is not disputed. 
(b) It is claimed that these pianos use mainly Japanese parts. This is also fact and not comment and this fact is also not disputed. 
(c) In actual fact 80% to 90% of these piano parts are made in North Korea by North Korean workmen. This is also fact and not comment and this is untrue.
In my judgment the defence of fair comment fails in 
 limine 
 and it is unnecessary to consider the effect of the particulars pleaded. I need only say that in considering whether the words complained of would reasonably have been understood as comment they may and in this case ought to be read in their proper context within the statement complained of and Robert Piano`s advertisement in which the statement appears but regard may not otherwise be had to matters outside those words even if they comprise matters at which the comment is directed. See 
Telnikoff v Matusevitch
 
[1992] 2 AC 343
. Robert Piano also pleads s 9 of the Defamation Act but in the circumstances of this case it has no application.
Paragraph 13 of the defence states: 
 
Further or in the alternative, the alleged occasion of publication was an occasion of qualified privilege.
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
 
(a) The defendants are one of the two major importers and distributors of Japanese made and assembled pianos, namely, Kawai pianos. The plaintiffs are importers of North Korean made and assembled pianos, namely, Asahi and Paco pianos. Both the defendants` and the plaintiffs` pianos are advertised in the newspapers. The public/consumers are readers of these newspapers and potential buyers of the defendants` and plaintiffs` pianos. 
 
(b) In the premises, the defendants were under a moral and social duty to publish the said words to the public/ consumers to ensure that they were not misled and the public/consumers have an interest to receive them. 
 
(c) Further the defendants published the said words in the reasonable and necessary protection of their own interests to ensure that the value and goodwill of Japanese pianos are not tarnished by North Korean pianos passed off as Japanese pianos.
  
 
 
The statement complained of appears in an advertisement in the Straits Times newspaper and the question that immediately comes to mind is whether the readers of the newspaper have a duty or interest to receive the communication corresponding with Robert Piano`s alleged moral and social duty to make the communication.
In the 
 Aaron 
 case 
[1996] 1 SLR 623
 a report featuring the appellants and a religious community known as the House of Israel was published in an issue of the Straits Times newspaper. The report consisted of three articles. The first two articles highlighted the nature, structure and religious practices of the appellants and the House of Israel. The House of Israel was referred to as a sect and the first appellant as its dominant leader. The third article contained a warning of the potential dangers of belonging to a sect with a leader who controlled the members. In libel proceedings commenced by the appellants the respondents pleaded the defence of qualified privilege among others. LP Thean JA (delivering the judgment of the court) examined the authorities and said at p 652: 
 
The respondents have only shown that the publication of the information was in the interest of a section of the public, namely, members of the Christian community. That is sectional rather than general interest of the public at large. On the authorities, such sectional interest does not give rise to a moral or social duty to publish the report. The respondents have, therefore, not succeeded on the defence of qualified privilege.
 
 
 
The public as represented by the readership of the newspaper as opposed to only a section of it does not have an interest to receive the communication of the words in the report through its publication in the newspaper.
 The Straits Times 
 newspaper has a wide readership in this country. Only a section of the readership would have any interest to receive the statement complained of. Any appeal the statement would have would be to those concerned with the piano trade as buyers or as persons likely to entertain any thoughts of buying pianos. Competing sellers and some others concerned with the practice of selling pianos may also have an interest to receive the statement although the statement itself is addressed only to buyers and potential buyers. I should have thought that the public as represented by the readership as opposed to that section of the readership who are buyers or potential buyers of pianos would not have the interest to receive the communication of the words in the statement complained of but there are other considerations also.
Robert Piano alleges that Cristofori Music`s (and its own) pianos are advertised in the newspapers and in these circumstances I think different considerations do arise. In 
Adam v Ward
 
[1917] AC 309
 the plaintiff who was formerly an officer in a cavalry regiment and was subsequently elected a member of Parliament in a speech in the House of Commons made a false charge against the General commanding the brigade of which his regiment formed part. The General having referred the matter to the Army Council the defendant by the direction of the Council wrote a letter to the General vindicating him against the charge made by the plaintiff. The letter contained defamatory statements about the plaintiff. This letter was sent to the press for publication and it was widely published in the British and Colonial press.
Earl Loreburn said at p 321: 
 
The facts of different cases vary infinitely, and I do not think the principle can be put more definitely than by saying that the judge has to consider the nature of the duty or right or interest and to rule whether or not the defendant has published something beyond what was germane and reasonably appropriate to the occasion, or has given to it a publicity incommensurate to the occasion. For a man ought not to be protected if he publishes what is in fact untrue of some one else when there is no occasion for his doing so, or when there is no occasion for his publishing it to the persons to whom he in fact publishes it.
 
 
 
Lord Atkinson expressed himself in sterner terms. He said at p 343: 
 
Every subject, therefore, who had an interest in the Army had an interest in being by a public communication informed of General Scobell`s acquittal. But I go further. I think it may be laid down as a general proposition that where a man, through the medium of Hansard`s reports of the proceedings in Parliament, publishes to the world vile slanders of a civil, naval, or military servant of the Crown in relation to the discharge by that servant of the duties of his office he selects the world as his audience, and that it is the duty of the heads of the service to which the servant belongs, if on investigation they find the imputation against him groundless, to publish his vindication to the same audience to which his traducer has addressed himself.
 
 
 
I might add that the plaintiff had gone on to say in his speech that the General was on his way home from abroad and the plaintiff hoped that when he saw the report of his speech in the paper as the plaintiff intended that he should do he would appreciate the meaning of certain specific words the plaintiff had used in his speech. The case before me is of course not concerned with anything said in Parliament.
Robert Piano has not by its defence identified Cristofori Music`s advertisements in relation to the privilege alleged. The statement of claim refers to one such published in 
 The Straits Times 
 newspaper on 1 January 1997 and the full text appears as a schedule. I have referred to this advertisement and to what it says about Asahi and Paco pianos. There is a claim that Asahi pianos use mainly Japanese parts. An earlier advertisement at p 22 of the agreed bundle makes a similar claim in respect of Paco pianos. Mr Wong Jian Bing of Cristofori Music himself said in his affidavit that Asahi and Paco pianos had been `widely publicised in the major local newspapers`.
I agree that Robert Piano had a moral and social duty to publish the statement containing the second sentence. I also agree that Robert Piano had an interest to communicate those words in the reasonable protection of its legitimate interests as a seller of pianos in general and of Japanese pianos in particular. There was also a corresponding interest in the buyers and potential buyers of pianos to receive the communication. I think the occasion when Robert Piano`s advertisement was published on 1 February 1997 was a privileged occasion. I should add that not every statement published on a privileged occasion is entitled to the protection of the privilege and a communication will not be protected if it is made to persons with no corresponding interest to receive it or if too much publicity is given to it.
In 
 Adam v Ward 
 defamatory statements against the plaintiff were made in the letter vindicating the General. Earl Loreburn said at p 322: 
 
 
I have had more doubt upon the question whether or not all that is contained in the letter which forms the subject of this action was covered by the privilege, and am disposed to take on that point the same view of the facts that appears from his summing-up to have been taken by Darling J.
  
 
 
Darling J had taken the view that the statements in the letter were not protected. However Earl Loreburn did not dissent from the majority view that the defamatory statements were relevant to vindicate the General.
The question before me is whether the second sentence in the statement complained of is protected. It makes assertions of fact which appear to me to be directly relevant to Cristofori Music`s claims about its pianos. I think the words in that sentence are relevant and are reasonably appropriate to the occasion. Having regard to the wide publicity given to Asahi and Paco pianos in the major local newspapers including 
 The Straits Times 
 newspaper I think Robert Piano has not given the second sentence in the statement any more publicity than was commensurate with the occasion. Claims have been made in advertisements in newspapers and a refutation of such claims in one advertisement in one of these newspapers appears to me to be appropriate. I think the communication of the words in the second sentence in the statement through an advertisement by Robert Piano in an issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 newspaper is entitled to protection as having been made on a privileged occasion.
Cristofori Music in its reply alleges that the words complained of in Robert Piano`s advertisement of 1 February 1997 were published maliciously. The reply also states: 
 
The defendants cannot purport to be under any moral or social duty to publish the said words when the said words were false and the defendants knew the same were false or did not care whether the same were true or false.
 
 
 
I think the words complained of refer only to the assertion of fact in the second sentence of the statement that in actual fact 80% to 90% of the piano parts are made in North Korea.
In 
Horrocks v Lowe
 
[1975] AC 135
 Viscount Dilhorne said at p 145: 
 
If a man abuses a privileged occasion by making defamatory statements which he knows to be false, express malice may easily be inferred. If, on such an occasion, he makes statements recklessly, not caring whether they be true or false, again malice may be inferred ...
 
 
 
Can a man who believes what he says on a privileged occasion to be true and which if true would not be an abuse of the occasion be held to have made his statements `recklessly whether they are true or false`? Gross and unreasoning prejudice may have led him to have uttered them recklessly whether they were true or false, but if he believes the truth of what he said, can he at the same time be said to be reckless of the truth or falsity of his statements? May be that others with more judgment and more wisdom would not have formed the same belief, but if, in fact, he believes what he says, he cannot at the same time, in my opinion, be reckless whether it is true or false. Such recklessness falls short of deliberate falsehood.
 
 
 
Lord Diplock said at pp 149, 150: 
 
The motive with which a person published defamatory matter can only be inferred from what he did or said or knew. If it be proved that he did not believe that what he published was true this is generally conclusive evidence of express malice ... save in the exceptional case where a person may be under a duty to pass on, without endorsing, defamatory reports made by some other person.
 
 
 
Apart from those exceptional cases, what is required on the part of the defamer to entitle him to the protection of the privilege is positive belief in the truth of what he published or, as it is generally though tautologously termed, `honest belief`. If he publishes untrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as in other branches of the law, treated as if he knew it to be false. But indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at a positive belief that it is true.
 
 
 
Where a protected communication is made on a privileged occasion and the maker believes the words communicated to be true then he is entitled to the protection of the privilege excepting the case of express malice `if it can be proved that the [maker] misused the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is accorded by law`. See further at p 150 per Lord Diplock.
Mr Robert Chiu did not say in his affidavit that he believed in the truth of the fact asserted, namely, that 80% to 90% of the piano parts of Asahi and Paco pianos were made in North Korea by North Korean workmen. He said it was true. He gave his grounds for saying that. He referred to exhibit CNYR-7. He explained under cross-examination that he meant 80% of all the parts but not by number though by what he did not say. His grounds were untenable and I think he knew it. He said nothing about whether the fact asserted was true when the statement in Robert Piano`s advertisement was published or whether he believed it to be true then.
Mr Robert Chiu said in his affidavit that he first became aware of Cristofori Music`s `misleading advertisements in the newspapers` some time in 1991. He said 
 Paco 
 was advertised as a Japanese piano but he knew that it was a North Korean piano. He wrote to the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (`ASAS`) to complain about the misleading advertisement but for some reason not disclosed by counsel his letter is not produced. The agreed bundle has only one 1991 advertisement of Cristofori Music`s Paco pianos. It refers to it as a `Japanese Brand Piano` with an asterisk leading to a note which says that it is assembled in North Korea. Mr Robert Chiu was not content with writing to ASAS. He also wrote to 
 The Straits Times 
. This letter also is not produced. On 5 December 1991 the New Paper, a newspaper published by the publishers of the Straits Times newspaper, carried an article under the heading `Row over ""Japanese` piano""`. The article featured part of a copy of Cristofori Music`s advertisement relating to Paco pianos where there appears a reference to `Japanese piano`. The article also contained what it said were statements made by Mr Wong, Mr Robert Chiu and Mr Tan of Consumers` Association of Singapore. The `row` was over the question whether a Paco piano could be advertised as a `Japanese piano`. Nothing was said in the article about whether the parts of the piano were Japanese parts or where the parts were made.
On 22 January 1993 ASAS wrote to both Cristofori Music and Robert Piano. The letter to Robert Piano was addressed to Mr Robert Chiu. ASAS advised that after deliberation on all the facts presented it formed the opinion that a Paco piano could not be claimed as a Japanese piano. Since then Cristofori Music`s advertisements have made no more references to `Japanese Brand Piano` or `Japanese piano` or anything implying that it is made or assembled in Japan. ASAS said nothing about the parts of the piano.
On 12 February 1997 Mr Robert Chiu wrote to the Singapore office of the Japan External Trade Organisation (`JETRO`) for some information about the manufacturers of Asahi and Paco pianos and for contact information on certain trade associations in Japan. He received a reply the next day but there is no evidence that he made any further inquiries or otherwise acted on the information he received. Mr Robert Chiu said in his affidavit that he received a letter dated 6 March 1998 from Mr Suzuki of Kawai Musical Inst Mfg Co Ltd (`KMIM`) of Japan forwarding a copy of a letter dated 16 February 1998 from the Shizuoka Prefecture Musical Inst Manufacturers` Association (`SPMIMA`). Mr Robert Chiu did not say when he communicated with KMIM for its assistance but it is likely to have been before 16 February 1998. The letter from SPMIMA is addressed to KMIM and is in question and answer form. Questions 3, 5 and 7 and the answers are: 
 
 
3 Are soundboard, bridges and iron frame made inside North Korea? 
 
Yes, they are. 
 
5 Are a few piano parts imported from Japan? 
 
The items exported from Japan are the metal parts like pedals, music wires, hinges, etc and parts to assemble the action and so on. Some other parts might be exported on irregular basis depending on the case. 
 
7 Is ASAHI piano same as PACO piano? 
 
Yes, it is. The both are the same and are made in North Korea.`
  
 
 
The soundboard, the bridges (of which there are two) and the iron frame are four of the parts which Mr Ohtani said were included in his count of the parts made in North Korea.
The advertisement containing the statement complained of was published on 1 February 1997. Cristofori Music`s solicitors` letter complaining about the contents of the statement was written on 5 February 1997. I think that prompted the inquiry to JETRO but nothing was said about piano parts in that inquiry or in the response from JETRO. There was no reply to Cristofori Music`s solicitors` letter. Robert Piano did not protest that any of the facts asserted in the statement was true. Other than writing that one letter to JETRO and communicating with KMIM at some undisclosed point of time Mr Robert Chiu did nothing at all that would be consistent with any belief he might have held in the truth of the fact asserted as to 80% to 90% of the piano parts. The statement of claim was filed on 15 February 1997 and in its original form (as well as in its final form) it is alleged that it is not true that 80% to 90% of the piano parts of Asahi and Paco pianos are made in North Korea. There is no evidence that Robert Piano or Mr Robert Chiu made any inquiries as to the truth of the fact asserted except for the communication which brought about the letter from SPMIMA dated 16 February 1998.
I think Mr Robert Chiu did not at any time at all before 1 February 1997 or even before the commencement of these proceedings know where most of the parts of the Asahi and Paco pianos were made and he made no attempt to find out. His attention was focussed on the question whether these pianos could be advertised as Japanese pianos. When this was resolved in Robert Piano`s favour by ASAS and the pianos ceased to be advertised as Japanese pianos he was still not satisfied. Cristofori Music continued to sell its pianos and became one of the largest sellers of pianos. Mr Robert Chiu affirmed his affidavit on 30 March 1998. By then he had received SPMIMA`s answers to the questions put to it. He did not say either in his affidavit or in court that he believed to be true the fact asserted in the second sentence of the statement complained of that 80% to 90% of the piano parts were made in North Korea. He should have known it to be untrue by then. I think that before he received SPMIMA`s answers he held no belief as to whether it was true or untrue. I think he held no such belief when he published the advertisement containing the statement complained of. He acted recklessly. He did not care whether it was true or not. In my judgment the statement complained of and in particular the second sentence was published by Robert Piano maliciously and it is not entitled to the protection of the privileged occasion when it was published.
The defamatory words mean that Cristofori Music is dishonest in claiming that Asahi and Paco pianos use mainly Japanese parts and that it has tried to deceive its customers and others into buying its pianos by wilfully representing them as using mainly Japanese parts when in fact they did not. These are defamatory of Cristofori Music in the way of its trade and Cristofori Music is one of the largest sellers of pianos. An unwarranted charge of dishonesty has been made and the public has been warned by the word `BEWARE` in bold and conspicuous print. Words such as `Sales Gimmick` and `PULL WOOL OVER YOUR EYES` have been used. There has been no apology. The words were published in an advertisement in the Straits Times newspaper and no attempt has been made to withdraw any part of those words or to make any correction. In its defence Robert Piano has pleaded justification and at the trial Mr Robert Chiu has claimed in evidence that the facts asserted in the defamatory statement were true. Substantial damages would be appropriate but Cristofori Music is a seller of pianos albeit one of the largest although there is no evidence of the size of its undertaking. It is not a bank as in 
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v Wright Norman & Ors and another action
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 760
  where Chao Hick Tin J awarded $50,000. I think damages should be in an amount of $50,000 and I adjudged accordingly. I also granted an injunction when counsel informed me from the bar that he was unable to give any undertaking on behalf of Robert Piano.
I turn now to the counterclaim. On 22 December 1996 Ms Ong Siok Huang ordered an Asahi piano from Cristofori Music and placed a deposit of $400. She said in her affidavit that about two weeks later on the advice of Mr Robert Chiu she went back to Cristofori Music to `seek clarification ... whether or not the Asahi piano was Japanese`. She did not get any answer which she considered satisfactory. She asked for her money back. Later she received Cristofori Music`s letter dated 31 January 1997. The letter contained these words: 
 
We are also aware that one of our competitor, Robert Piano Co is spreading the untrue statement to the public. We definitely reserved the right to take legal action against them. As you are one of the victim, we hope you can be one of our witness in the court, if the situation become necessary.
 
 
 
Paragraph 23 of the counterclaim states: 
 
In their natural and ordinary meaning, the said words meant and were understood to mean that:
 
 
 
 
(a) the defendants had been spreading lies and untrue statements to the public in order to mislead the public; 
 
(b) members of the public like Miss Ong Siok Huang, the addressee of the said letter were victimised by such statements by the defendants and as such, had suffered loss or damage; 
 
(c) the defendants were a dishonest company.
  
 
 
In its defence to the counterclaim Cristofori Music denies that the words bear or are understood to bear or are capable of bearing the meanings alleged. Cristofori Music also relies on justification, fair comment on a matter of public interest and finally qualified privilege.
The words clearly say that Robert Piano is spreading `the untrue statement` to the public. No statement is expressly referred to but I think the words can refer to `some` untrue statement or `an` untrue statement. Grammatical accuracy is not a feature of the letter from which the words are taken. I entertain no doubt that the ordinary person will understand the words to mean that Robert Piano is spreading something to the public which something is untrue. His understanding will be reinforced by Cristofori Music reserving the right to take legal action against Robert Piano. I think the first meaning pleaded may be modified to: 
 
Robert Piano is spreading an untrue statement to the public and Cristofori Music has a right to take legal action against Robert Piano.
 
 
 
I have considered the other meanings pleaded but I do not think the ordinary person will understand the words to mean any of these things. They do not say that Ms Ong has been victimised by Robert Piano or by `such statements` meaning the untrue statements made by Robert Piano. Also spreading an untrue statement is not necessarily dishonest and in most cases no question of dishonesty arises.
To say that Robert Piano is spreading something untrue to the public and that Cristofori Music has a right to take legal action against it implies that Robert Piano has committed a wrong for which Cristofori Music can take legal action. I think words with that meaning will tend to lower Robert Piano in the estimation of right thinking members of society generally. In my judgment the words are defamatory of Robert Piano.
Until the publication of the advertisement on 1 February 1997, ie the day after Cristofori Music`s letter containing the defamatory words was written there is no evidence that Robert Piano has said anything about Cristofori Music that is untrue. There is no evidence that it has been spreading any such thing at all. The defence of justification has not been proved.
In its defence to the counterclaim Cristofori Music states in para 10: 
 
Further or alternatively, the said words were fair comment on a matter of public interest, namely the defendants were propagating the untrue statement that the plaintiffs` pianos did not use 90% Japanese parts to the public ...
 
 
 
The words complained of do not identify the untrue statement. There is no reference to the use of 90% Japanese parts or any Japanese parts in those words. The letter in an earlier part says: 
 
The 
 Asahi
 piano, model: U1-AS is 100% Japanese designed piano, using 90% Japanese parts, assembled in Japanese joint-ventured factory in Pyongyang ...
 
 
 
The letter does not say that Robert Piano says any of this is untrue. It does not say that Robert Piano says Cristofori Music`s pianos or Asahi pianos did not use 90% Japanese parts and even if this can be read into the letter it still offers no assistance to any understanding of the statement as a comment. The statement pleaded and the words complained of are not and are incapable of being understood as comments. In my judgment the defence of fair comment on a matter of public interest fails.
Paragraph 11 of the defence to the counterclaim states: 
 
Further or alternatively, the said words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege.
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
 
(a) The plaintiffs repeat paras 9(a) to (f) herein 
 
... .
  
 
 
Paragraph 9(a) states: 
 
According to feedback from the plaintiffs` customers, the defendants had been asserting that the plaintiffs` `Asahi` pianos did not use 90% Japanese parts (hereinafter referred to as the `defendants` statements`).
 
 
 
No evidence was adduced to prove these allegations in para 9(a) of the defence. Even Cristofori Music`s letter does not allege that Robert Piano had made any such assertions. I find that para 9(a) has not been proved. Paragraph 9(c) alleges that the statements attributed to Robert Piano (and attributed without any basis at all) are untrue. It is in 
 fact 
 untrue that Asahi pianos use 90% Japanese parts if by that it means that 90% of the parts are Japanese. Mr Ohtani said that about 19% of the parts were made in North Korea. The other paragraphs of the particulars are irrelevant or based on irrelevant assumptions.
In his affidavit Mr Wong said: 
 
The plaintiffs further say that they honestly believe that it was the defendants who were making statements about the plaintiffs` piano as they received feedback from their customers that the defendants` sales staff had informed their customers that the plaintiffs` pianos were made in North Korea.
 
 
 
Asahi and Paco pianos are in fact made in North Korea. But this is not even the statement identified in the particulars. There is no evidence that Mr Wong who wrote the letter containing the defamatory words or anyone else in his company believed that Asahi pianos use 90% Japanese parts.
Whether Asahi pianos use 90% Japanese parts or not is a fact within the knowledge of Cristofori Music or which it has the means to acquire. If it has learned that Robert Piano has asserted that it is untrue it would have refuted it. It would have done so in its letter of 31 January 1997. It would have done so when its solicitors wrote to complain about Robert Piano`s advertisement of 1 February 1997. It did not do so. Mr Ohtani wrote to Mr Wong on 6 February 1997 and he enclosed drawings showing parts made in Japan. They are the drawings exhibited to his affidavit and they do not show 90% of the parts to be Japanese. Cristofori Music adduced no evidence to prove that Robert Piano made the allegedly untrue statement. I think Mr Wong did not even know precisely what it was that he referred to as the `untrue statement` in his letter. He had no belief in the truth of that assertion. He acted recklessly. He did not care whether the fact asserted was true or false. In my judgment the defamatory words were published maliciously and the defence of qualified privilege fails.
The defamatory words appear in the letter addressed to Ms Ong. Its publication is limited although she showed it to a salesman of Robert Piano who read it to her. She said she could only read a little English and understood if someone read to her slowly and explained to her. Mr Robert Chiu said that the letter was read by Ms Ong, the salesman and several other persons present at Robert Piano`s showroom when Ms Ong brought it there. Mr Robert Chiu would have known of it. There was no protest. There was no letter complaining of the libel not even when Cristofori Music`s solicitors had written to complain about the advertisement. On 15 February 1997 this action was commenced and it may well be thought that by then there would be little point in any correspondence. I think that is reasonable. I think in all the circumstances $5,000 by way of damages will be reasonable and fair compensation and I gave judgment accordingly.

ss 247, 362 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
This was the Public Prosecutor`s appeal against the order of the district judge in show cause proceedings in respect of the forfeiture of a cash bail of $15,000. The respondent was the surety for a Saudi Arabian national, one Mohammed AA Alkholani (the `accused`). In DAC 21672/99, the accused faced a charge of outraging the modesty of a stewardess on board an SIA flight from Saudi Arabia to Singapore. Whilst on bail, the accused left Singapore on 21 July 1999 and was due to return to Singapore on 12 August 1999 for a hearing on 13 August 1999. However, the accused failed to return for the hearing.
On 13 August 1999, at the show cause proceedings before the district judge, the respondent informed the court that on 11 August 1999 he had sent a facsimile to the accused in Saudi Arabia, reminding him to attend court on 13 August 1999. He also revealed that the money for the $15,000 cash bail was provided by the accused.
The district judge ordered the forfeiture of $10,000 out of the entire $15,000. The remaining $5,000 was remitted to the respondent. The Public Prosecutor brought this appeal on the ground that, in the circumstances of the case, sufficient cause why the entire bail of $15,000 should not be forfeited had not been shown and the district judge had erred in not forfeiting the entire sum of $15,000. This appeal was not contested by the respondent. The district judge had himself taken the unusual step of supporting this appeal and recognising the error on his part. After hearing the submission on the prosecution`s case, I allowed the appeal for the reasons which I set out below.
First, forfeiting $10,000 and remitting the remaining $5,000 to the respondent would result in the respondent receiving $5,000 which clearly did not belong to him. Moreover, to remit the $5,000 would be to allow the respondent to profit from the failure of the accused to attend court when this resulted from his own failure to ensure the attendance of the accused. Secondly, it would appear that the accused had conveniently bought himself a passage out of our criminal jurisdiction by putting up the $15,000 through the respondent, when he had probably intended all along never to return. It appeared to me that the district judge had failed to give adequate consideration to the source of the funds for the cash bail. Having had the benefit of the knowledge that the $15,000 cash bail was provided by the accused himself, it was clearly wrong to remit any part of the $15,000 upon his failure to attend court.
The principles governing the forfeiture of a bail bond were extensively discussed by Karthigesu J (as he then was) in 
Loh Kim Chiang v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 233
 . He cited a passage from the judgment of Donaldson LJ in 
R v Knightsbridge Crown Court, ex p Newton
 
[1980] Crim LR 715
, which was referred to in 
 Loh Kim Chiang v PP 
 at p 239: 
 
It has been said by this court, and by other courts time and again, that entering into suretyship (going bail for someone, to use the common phrase) is an extremely serious matter not to be lightly undertaken, and those who go bail must understand that, if the accused fails to surrender to his bail, it is only in the most exceptional cases that the court will be prepared to modify the prima facie position, which is that the amount for which the person concerned has stood surety will be forfeit in full.
 
 
 
The following passage from the judgment of Lord Denning MR in 
R v Southampton Justices, ex p Green
 
[1975] 2 All ER 1073
 at pp 1077-1078, was also referred to in 
 Loh Kim Chiang v PP 
 at pp 237-238: 
 
By what principles are the justices to be guided? They ought, I think, to consider to what extent the surety was at fault. If he or she connived at the disappearance of the accused man, or aided it or abetted it, it would be proper to forfeit the whole of the sum. If he or she was wanting in due diligence to secure his appearance, it might be proper to forfeit the whole or a substantial part of it, depending on the degree of fault. If he or she was guilty of no want of diligence and used every effort to secure the appearance of the accused man, it might be proper to remit it entirely.
 
 
 
The prosecution submitted that the respondent in this case had not done enough to ensure the accused`s attendance in court by simply sending a cursory facsimile message one day before the date the accused was required to return to Singapore. I agree that the respondent had not shown sufficient cause why the whole amount of $15,000 should not be forfeited. There was no evidence that the respondent had taken any other steps to contact the accused. Moreover, given the fact that the cash bail was provided by the accused himself, logically, there would be no real incentive for the respondent to ensure the accused`s attendance in court.
A preliminary issue that arose in this appeal was whether the Public Prosecutor had the locus standi to lodge an appeal against an order made in such show cause proceedings. The difficulty arose because, in such proceedings, the surety is called upon to show cause as to why the bonded sum should not be forfeited. Section 247 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the `CPC`) enables, inter alia, the Public Prosecutor to lodge an appeal against any judgment, sentence or order pronounced by any district court or magistrate`s court in a criminal case or matter to which he is a party if there was any error in law or in fact. The surety is not accused of any crime and is not a party to any criminal proceedings. Neither is the Public Prosecutor, strictly speaking, a party to such show cause proceedings. In practice, the prosecution is usually not even called upon to address the court in these proceedings.
Section 362 of the CPC, however, specifically states that all orders made under s 361 of the CPC by any magistrate`s court or district court shall be appealable. Section 361 provides for the procedure on the forfeiture of a bail bond. Although s 362 is silent on who can lodge an appeal, I agreed with the prosecution`s submission that it would be too restrictive to confine the right of appeal to only the surety when the Public Prosecutor also has an interest in the matter and should be considered a party to the proceedings. I was therefore of the view that the Public Prosecutor had the locus standi to lodge the appeal in this case.
The question of bail only arises out of a criminal proceeding. Thus, proceedings arising from bail do not exist in vacuo and show cause proceedings actually constitute a continuation of the original criminal proceeding. In cases such as this, the Public Prosecutor is clearly a party to the proceedings when the initial order to allow bail is made. During the bail applications, the Public Prosecutor can make submissions to object to bail being granted or to apply for bail to be raised. Since the whole purpose of bail and the proceedings involving issues of bail is to secure the attendance of accused persons in criminal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor should be considered a party to such proceedings. It followed that the Public Prosecutor had the locus standi to appeal against an order on the forfeiture of a bail bond.

This was an appeal from the decision of the district court in Summons No PS 877/98 in which the appellant was convicted of two offences, one under s 156(1) and the other under s 156(5) of the Companies Act (Cap 50).
 The facts 
 
 
 
The appellant was at all material times an officer in various companies. He was the managing director of Mcspec Far East Development Pte Ltd (`MFED`) and a director of Xiamen Mcspec (S) Pte Ltd (`XMS`). He was also a director and manager of Triple Star Shipping and Trading Co (Pte) Ltd (`Triple Star`). In addition, he held 185,000 shares in Triple Star, which was half of the total issued and paid-up share capital of Triple Star.
On 8 January 1992, MFED was awarded a contract by the People`s Association to build Tampines West Community Centre (`TWCC`) for a sum of more than $5m. On 15 January 1992, the appellant, on behalf of MFED, entered into a contract with XMS to award the construction of TWCC to XMS. There was a provision in the contract with XMS that consultation fees of 10% payable to MFED were to be deducted from XMS`s progress claims. The appellant did not make a declaration at any meeting of the directors of XMS of any interest in the contract between MFED and XMS to construct TWCC.
When XMS was constructing TWCC, Triple Star was supplying building materials to XMS under a supplies agreement. There was no documentary evidence of this supplies agreement. The appellant also failed to declare any interest in the supplies agreement between Triple Star and XMS at a meeting of the directors of XMS.
Subsequently, the appellant, in his capacity as an officer of Triple Star, sent a letter dated 21 August 1992 to XMS to inform XMS that Triple Star had stopped supplying materials to the TWCC site pursuant to the supplies agreement between Triple Star and XMS and to demand full settlement of the outstanding account.
 The charges 
 
 
 
In the district court, the following charges were brought against the appellant: 
 
The first charge
 
 
 
You, Yeo Geok Seng (m/49 years), NRIC No S0098551/A, are charged that you, on or about 15 January 1992, in Singapore, whilst being the Managing Director of Mcspec Far East Development Pte Ltd (`the Company`), did fail to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of your duties as a director of the Company, to wit, when you assigned the contract to construct the Tampines West Community Centre, which contract had been awarded to the Company by the People`s Association, to Xiamen Mcspec (S) Pte Ltd without the consent of the People`s Association in contravention of Clause 15(1) of the Conditions of Contract, which act was in breach of Section 157(1) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50, 1990 Revised Edition)(`the Act`), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 157(3) of the Act.
 
 
 
The second charge
 
 
 
You, Yeo Geok Seng (m/49 years), NRIC No. S0098551/A, are charged that you, between 15 January 1992 and 29 July 1992, in Singapore, whilst you were a director of Xiamen Mcspec (S) Pte Ltd (`the Company`), failed to declare in any of the meetings of the directors of the Company your interest in the contract with Mcspec Far East Development Pte Ltd (`MFED`) to construct the Tampines West Community Centre, namely, that you were the Managing Director of MFED, which conduct was in contravention of s 156(5) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) (`the Act`), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 156(10) of the Act.
 
 
 
The third charge
 
 
 
You, Yeo Geok Seng (m/49 years), NRIC No S0098551/A, are charged that you, between 15 January 1992 and 29 July 1992, in Singapore, whilst you were a director of Xiamen Mcspec (S) Pte Ltd (`the Company`), failed to declare in any of the meetings of the directors of the Company your interest in the supplies agreement with Triple Star Shipping & Trading Co (Pte) Ltd (`Triple Star`), namely, that you were a director and a shareholder of Triple Star, which conduct was in contravention of s 156(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) (`the Act`), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 156(10) of the Act.
 
 
 
The trial judge convicted the appellant on the second charge and the third charge and sentenced the appellant to a fine of $5,000 on each charge. The first charge was withdrawn by the prosecution and the appellant was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The appellant appealed against his convictions and sentences on both charges. In the court below, both parties had proceeded on an agreed statement of facts. Therefore, there was no dispute as to the facts and the only issues that remained to be decided on appeal were questions of law. After hearing the submissions from both parties, I dismissed the appeal for the reasons which I set out below. I shall first deal with the appeal against the conviction on the second charge and then on the third charge and finally the appeal against the sentence imposed.
 The second charge 
 
 
 
Section 156(5) of the Act reads as follows: 
 
Every director of a company who holds any office or possesses any property whereby whether directly or indirectly duties or interests might be created in conflict with his duties or interests as director shall declare at a meeting of the directors of the company the fact and the nature, character and extent of the conflict.
 
 
 
The issue to be decided here was whether the appellant, by virtue of his office as the managing director of MFED, held an office whereby directly or indirectly, duties or interests might be created in conflict with his duties or interest as a director of XMS and thus was obliged to declare the conflict under s 156(5) of the Act.
The crux of the appellant`s case was that an interest which arose merely from a directorship in another company was insufficient to impose a duty of disclosure on a director of a company if he did not have any personal interest which conflicted with the interests of either company. The appellant contended that, apart from being the managing director of MFED, he did not have any personal interest in the contract between MFED and XMS to build TWCC.
In support of his case, the appellant relied on various authorities to show that a director has breached his fiduciary duty towards his company only if he has placed himself in a position where there is a conflict between his personal interest and the interest of the company. The appellant placed particular reliance on the cases of 
 London and Mashonaland Exploration Co Ltd v New Mashonaland Exploration Co Ltd 
 [1891] 
WN 165 and Berlei Hestia (NZ) Ltd v Fernyhough
 
[1980] 2 NZLR 150
 as authority for the proposition that a director does not breach the rule against conflict of duty and interest merely by being appointed a director of another company.
I had the opportunity of perusing the authorities cited by the appellant. In my opinion, those cases, including 
Boardman v Phipps
 
[1966] 3 All ER 721
, might be useful in determining the scope of fiduciary duties of company directors at common law. However, we were concerned here with the interpretation of a statutory provision, namely, s 156(5) of the Act, and none of the authorities cited by the appellant was helpful in this respect. Other authorities cited by the appellant, including 
Gray v New Augarita Porcupine Mines Ltd
 
[1962] 3 DLR 1
 and
 State of South Australia & Anor v Marcus Clark 
 14 ACLC 1,019, involved a director`s duty of disclosure but had nothing to do with s 156(5). The cases of 
 London and Mashonaland Exploration Co Ltd v New Mashonaland Exploration 
 (supra) and 
 Berlei Hestia (NZ) Ltd v Fernyhough 
 (supra) were not relevant either. Even if a director does not breach his fiduciary duty to his company by being the director of another company, it does not mean that he would never have to disclose the fact of his other directorship to his company.
I could not accept the appellant`s contention that a director has a duty of disclosure under s 156(5) of the Act only if he has a personal interest that conflicts with his duty to his company. In my mind, the wording of s 156(5) is clear and wide enough to impose a duty of disclosure on a director who holds a directorship in another company, even if he does not have a personal interest, as long as there is a potential conflict of duty arising from his office as a director in both companies. Section 156(5) does not require the director to have a personal interest that in fact gives rise to a conflict. In such cases of multiple directorship, the question is whether, by virtue of being a director of two or more companies, a conflict of duty might potentially arise. If so, the director is required to declare the conflict under s 156(5). It may not be in every case of multiple directorship that the duty under s 156(5) would arise but whether such duty arises would depend on relevant circumstances, including the relationship between the companies of which the same person is a director.
In this case, there was clearly a conflict of duty arising from the appellant`s office of managing director of MFED and that of director of XMS. In respect of the contract between MFED and XMS to build TWCC, the appellant, as the managing director of MFED, owed a duty to MFED to secure the highest possible commission from XMS. On the other hand, as a director of XMS, the appellant owed a duty to XMS to ensure that the commission to be paid to MFED by XMS was as low as possible. Moreover, the appellant would also be placed in a position of conflict of duty and interest if a dispute arose between MFED and XMS in relation to the contract. Such conflict of duty imposed on the appellant the duty of disclosure under s 156(5) of the Act.
 The third charge 
 
 
 
The appellant was also convicted under s 156(1) of the Act. Section 156(1) provides: 
 
Subject to this section, every director of a company who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in a contract or proposed contract with the company shall as soon as practicable after the relevant facts have come to his knowledge declare the nature of his interest at a meeting of the directors of the company.
 
 
 
In respect of the third charge, two issues had to be decided; first, whether under s 156(1) of the Act the appellant, as a director, manager and 50% shareholder of Triple Star, was directly or indirectly interested in the supplies agreement between XMS and Triple Star; and secondly, if the appellant was so interested, whether he had knowledge of the relevant facts under s 156(1).
With regard to the first issue, the appellant again submitted that the interest referred to in s 156(1) of the Act meant the director`s personal interest which might conflict with his duty to the company. The appellant contended that he did not have a duty of disclosure under s 156(1) because he had no such personal interest in the supplies agreement between XMS and Triple Star.
Similarly, I was unable to agree with the appellant that s 156(1) of the Act operates only when the director has a personal interest in a contract. Section 156(1) is worded widely and applies to any situation in which the director is `directly or indirectly interested` in a contract, not just when he has a personal interest in it.
In determining whether the appellant had an `interest` under s 156(1) of the Act, the exception in s 156(2) was relevant. Section 156(2) provides as follows: 
 
The requirements of subsection (1) shall not apply in any case where the interest of the director consists only of being a member or creditor of a corporation which is interested in a contract or proposed contract with the first-mentioned company if the interest of the director may properly be regarded as not being a material interest.
 
 
 
It appeared to me that the amount of shareholding which constitutes a material interest under s 156(2) of the Act may vary according to the facts of each case. In most instances, a controlling interest in a company would be a material interest and would require disclosure. In this case, even if the appellant`s 50% shareholding in Triple Star was not a controlling interest, it was clearly a substantial shareholding by which he could influence the decisions of the company and thus constituted a material interest under s 156(2). The appellant, therefore, could not avail himself of the exception in s 156(2).
The appellant had a duty under s 156(1) of the Act to disclose his interest in the supplies agreement between XMS and Triple Star by virtue of his material interest as a 50% shareholder in Triple Star. The appellant, however, was more than just a 50% shareholder of Triple Star. He was also a director and manager of Triple Star. Notably, the exception in s 156(2) of the Act applies only to a shareholder or creditor whose interest in the contracting company is not material but does not apply to a director of the contracting company.
In this case, I had no doubt that the appellant had an interest in the supplies agreement between XMS and Triple Star under s 156(1) of the Act because, as a director, manager and 50% shareholder in Triple Star, he was interested in Triple Star`s profits. This interest was clearly in conflict with the interest of XMS under the supplies agreement. I was thus of the opinion that the appellant had a duty to disclose and should have disclosed his interest in the supplies agreement between XMS and Triple Star under s 156(1).
The second issue in respect of the third charge arose because of the requirement in s 156(1) of the Act for a director to declare the nature of his interest in a contract with his company as soon as practicable after the relevant facts have come to his knowledge. The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in convicting him on the third charge because the prosecution did not prove that he had knowledge of the supplies agreement between XMS and Triple Star at the relevant time of the third charge, i.e. between 15 January 1992 and 29 July 1992.
In the court below, the prosecution did not adduce any documentary evidence of the supplies agreement between XMS and Triple Star because there was no such written agreement. It was nonetheless agreed between the parties that such an agreement existed. At the trial, the prosecution produced a letter written by the appellant on 21 August 1992 informing XMS that Triple Star had stopped supplying materials to XMS for the construction of TWCC. The appellant submitted that this letter dated 21 August 1992 could not be evidence that, at the material time of the third charge, i.e. between 15 January 1992 and 29 July 1992, he was aware of the agreement and that therefore, the prosecution had not proved that he had knowledge of the supplies agreement at the relevant time of the third charge.
I did not agree with the appellant`s allegation that the prosecution had not discharged their burden of proving the requisite knowledge on his part. The trial judge was clearly aware that the knowledge of the appellant was a necessary ingredient of the third charge and found on the facts that he had the requisite knowledge. There was no reason to overturn his finding on this point. Although the agreed statement of facts used in the court below did not expressly state that the appellant had knowledge of the supplies agreement at the relevant time of the third charge, it stated that the appellant had been a director and manager of Triple Star since 22 January 1982. As a director and manager of Triple Star at the relevant time, it was reasonable to infer that the appellant was aware of the supplies agreement between XMS and Triple Star. Moreover, the prosecution also adduced evidence in the form of frequent correspondence between XMS and the appellant in his capacity as the managing director of MFED regarding the construction of TWCC. It could be seen from such evidence that the appellant took a keen personal interest in the progress of the TWCC project and it could be reasonably inferred that he knew that XMS was obtaining the materials for the project from Triple Star. In view of such evidence, the trial judge did not err in finding that the prosecution had made out a case against the appellant which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction.
At the close of the prosecution`s case below, the appellant`s counsel made a submission of no case to answer. This submission was rejected by the trial judge who held that the prosecution had made out a case against the appellant which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction. The trial judge accordingly called for the defence and called upon the appellant to give evidence on his own behalf. The appellant elected to remain silent. The trial judge then drew an adverse inference against the appellant and found him guilty of both charges.
In the course of his arguments on appeal, the appellant`s counsel contended that the trial judge should not have drawn an adverse inference against the appellant. I did not agree with this contention because clearly, under s 196(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), the trial judge was entitled to draw an adverse inference against the appellant in view of his election to remain silent. This principle was clear from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in 
Oh Laye Koh v PP
 
[1995] 1 CLAS 142
 at 147 where it was stated: 
 
The trial judge was at liberty to draw any inferences as may appear proper from the failure of the appellant to give evidence on oath, including the ultimate adverse inference that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged.
 
 
 
 
 
 The sentence 
 
 
 
 
 
The sentencing provision for offences under s 156 of the Act is s 156(10) which reads: 
 
Any director of a company who fails to comply with any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year.
 
 
 
The trial judge sentenced the appellant to the maximum fine of $5,000 for each offence. The appellant`s ground of appeal against the sentences was that they were manifestly excessive because, inter alia, he was a first offender at age 49 and he did not use his position as a director of XMS to obtain secret profits for himself or to obtain confidential information to the detriment of XMS.
After considering the submissions from both sides, I concluded that the appellant`s sentences were not manifestly excessive. Any breach of s 156 of the Act is a serious offence and, in most cases, the maximum fine of $5,000 has been imposed unless there are mitigating factors. There were none in this case. On the other hand, the presence of aggravating factors such as the deliberate flouting of the provisions might well have resulted in the offender being sentenced to imprisonment and not just to a fine.
 The conclusion 
 
 
 
I recognised that the effect of a wide interpretation of the provisions of s 156 of the Act will mean that even an innocent failure to disclose with no proven loss to the relevant company can bring about the conviction of the director involved. This is a harsh reality but the fact remains that directors are under an onerous duty by virtue of their positions as fiduciaries entrusted with the responsibilities of managing their companies` businesses and making corporate decisions for the benefit of their companies. If a person undertakes such duties and responsibilities as a company director, he should also be responsible for familiarising himself with the various rules of disclosure and other statutory duties under the Act.
In this respect, the following statement by Wallace P in 
 Castlereagh Motels Ltd v Davies-Roe 
 (1966) 67 State Reports (NSW) 279 at 284 is enlightening: 
 
The general intendment of the provisions is to assist in ensuring proper administration of the affairs of the company by preventing a director abusing his knowledge and powers for his own benefit and being put in a position where his duty may conflict with his interests and severe penalties are imposed for breaches of the provisions. It is not the prevention of financial loss to the company which appears to be the main or direct object of the provisions, but the ensuring that companies are benefited by the proper and devoted discharge by directors of their fiduciary duties.
 
 
 
The above statement concerned s 123 of the New South Wales Companies Act 1961 and s 129 of the New South Wales Companies Act 1936, which are in pari materia with s 156 of our Companies Act.
Section 156 of the Act exists for the benefit and protection of the company so that its board of directors may make informed decisions in the light of declarations of interest by individual directors. A wide interpretation of s 156 is therefore necessary to give effect to its purpose.
For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the appeal and affirmed the appellant`s conviction and sentence

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This was an application by the Law Society of Singapore under s 98 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1997 Ed) (`the Act`) to make absolute an order to show cause pursuant to the Disciplinary Committee`s determination that there was cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action to be taken against Rick Tham Yu Xian (`the respondent`) under s 83(1) of the Act. Having heard the submissions of counsel for the Law Society as well as those of the respondent, who appeared before us in person, we were unanimously of the opinion that the respondent should be struck off the roll. We now give our reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
The respondent is an advocate and solicitor of approximately 18 years` standing and at all material times, was practising as a partner in the firm of Tham & Partners. The facts, as set out in the Law Society`s Statement of Case and to which the respondent admitted without qualification, were as follows.
On or about 16 August 1991, one Lim Bin Hiong alias Abun Sunarjo (`Lim`) acquired an option from property developers Singapore United Estates (Pte) Ltd (`the developers`) to purchase a semi-detached house at 1 Dedap Gardens (`the property`) for $58,150, being 5% of the purchase price of $1.163m. The property falls within the definition of `residential property` in s 2 of the Residential Property Act (Cap 274) (`RPA`) and Lim, an Indonesian national, was at the material time a `foreign person` as defined by the same section. On or about 23 August 1991, Lim retained the respondent to act for him in (a) the purchase of the property from the developers; and (b) his application for Permanent Resident status in Singapore.
On 24 August 1991, Messrs Rodyk & Davidson, the solicitors for the developers, wrote to Messrs Tham & Partners, stating that the option over the property was subject to Lim obtaining the requisite approval from the authorities under s 25 of the RPA. On 5 October 1991, the respondent wrote to the Controller of Residential Property at the Land Dealings (Approval) Unit (`LDU`) to apply for approval for Lim to purchase the property. On 28 November 1991, the LDU wrote to Messrs Tham & Partners, informing them that Lim`s application to purchase the property had not been approved.
On 4 December 1991, Messrs Tham & Partners wrote to Messrs Rodyk & Davidson, informing them that Lim had decided to assign the right to purchase the property to one Steven Ang Ah Hoe (`Ang`) and that the respondent would be representing Ang in the purchase. On or about 5 December 1991, Lim informed the developers that he no longer wished to purchase the property. On or about the same day, the developers granted Ang an option to purchase the property. On 6 December 1991, the developers returned Lim`s option money of $58,150 to Messrs Tham & Partners. On or about 31 December 1991, Ang entered into a sale and purchase agreement with the developers to purchase the property for $1.163m.
A trust deed was entered into by Ang as trustee and Lim as beneficiary on an unspecified date in 1991. The deed was stated to be supplemental to the sale and purchase agreement between Ang and the developers whereby he agreed to purchase the property from the developers at a price of $1.163m. The deed also stated, inter alia, that in consideration of the sum of $1.163m paid to Ang by Lim, Ang would (a) hold the property as trustee in trust for Lim as beneficiary; and (b) transfer the property to Lim upon the latter`s written request.
On 7 January 1992, Ang lodged a caveat over the property. On 8 April 1992, Ang signed an acknowledgment of debt drafted by the respondent, whereby Ang acknowledged that he was indebted to Lim in the amount of $1.163m. The acknowledgment of debt was backdated to 31 December 1991. On the same day, Lim entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Ang to purchase the property at $1.163m. The sale was conditional on Lim obtaining the requisite approval from the LDU, for which he made a second application on that day. On 9 April 1992, Lim lodged a caveat over the property.
On 3 July 1992, the LDU wrote to Messrs Tham & Partners, informing them that Lim`s application for approval to purchase the property was again unsuccessful. On 27 July 1992, Messrs Tham & Partners received a letter from Messrs Rodyk & Davidson stating that Ang`s purchase of the property was to be completed within 21 days, failing which the developers would treat the sale and purchase agreement as repudiated.
On 4 August 1992, Lim lodged a police report against Ang. Ang was subsequently charged with having committed an offence under the RPA in DAC 16807/95. On or about 15 September 1995, the respondent was charged in the subordinate courts in DAC 16808/95 with having committed an offence under s 3(1)(c) of the RPA. The charge against him read: 
 
You, Rick Tham Yu Xian, NRIC No 0232048G, are charged that you, on or about 31 December 1991, in Singapore, abetted one Lim Bin Hiong (`Lim`), a foreign person as defined under the Residential Property Act (Cap 274) (`the Act`), in acquiring an interest in a residential property, namely, Lot 2099 Mukim 2, also known as 2 Dedap Link, Singapore 809547 (`the property`) [the property was subsequently renamed 2 Dedap Link], when you intentionally aided him in an arrangement whereby one Steven Ang Ah Hoe (`Ang`), a Singapore citizen, was to purchase and hold the property for Lim`s benefit, in that you acted for Ang in the latter`s purchase of the property as Lim`s nominee, and prepared a trust deed to this effect, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 3(1)(c) and punishable under s 36(1) of the Act read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The respondent claimed trial and denied that he had prepared the abovementioned trust deed. On 3 August 1996, the respondent was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $5,000.
Upon the respondent`s conviction, the Council of the Law Society proceeded under s 85(2) of the Act and laid an information touching upon the respondent`s conduct to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel, and as a result an Inquiry Committee was duly empanelled to inquire into the information. The Inquiry Committee recommended that a formal investigation be held by a Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the information, and accordingly, on application by the Council, a Disciplinary Committee was duly appointed by the Chief Justice on 30 March 1998 under s 90 of the Act. The charge formulated against the respondent by the Law Society read as follows: 
 
You, Rick Tham Yu Xian, NRIC No 0232048G, are charged that on 3 August 1996, you were convicted on a charge that you abetted one Lim Bin Hiong (`Lim`), a foreign person as defined under the Residential Property Act (Cap 274) (`the Act`), in acquiring an interest in a residential property, namely, Lot 2099 Mukim 2, also known as 2 Dedap Link, Singapore 809547 (`the property`), when you intentionally aided him in an arrangement whereby one Steven Ang Ah Hoe (`Ang`), a Singapore citizen, was to purchase and hold the property for Lim`s benefit, in that you acted for Ang in the latter`s purchase of the property as Lim`s nominee, and prepared a trust deed to this effect, an offence ... under s 3(1)(c) and punishable under s 36(1) of the Act read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and you are thereby guilty of conduct implying a defect character which makes you unfit for your profession within the meaning of s 83(2)(a) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1990 Ed).
 
 
 
 
 
 The Disciplinary Committee proceedings 
 
 
 
 
 
The Disciplinary Committee hearing was held on 30 November 1998 and the Disciplinary Committee delivered its findings in a report dated 2 March 1999 (`the report`). It found that the charge against the respondent was proved as the respondent had been convicted of an offence implying a defect of character which rendered him unfit for his profession and determined (pursuant to s 93(1)(c) of the Act) that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 83(2)(a) of the Act. Accordingly, the Law Society applied under s 98 for an order requiring the respondent to show cause why he should not be dealt with under the provisions of s 83(1) of the Act.
 The application 
 
 
 
It is trite law that it was not open to either the respondent or the court to go behind the respondent`s conviction by virtue of s 83(6) of the Act (by which the conviction must be accepted as `final and conclusive`): 
Re Mohomed Jiffry Muljee
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 520
  and 
Law Society of Singapore v Narmal Singh
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 184
 , and the sole question for determination in the present proceedings was what consequences should flow from the fact that the respondent had committed the offence of which he was convicted - abetting the purchase by a `foreign person` of `residential property` (as defined in s 2 of the RPA) in contravention of s 3(1)(c) of the RPA.
To begin with, conviction of a criminal offence which implies a defect of character prima facie renders an advocate and solicitor unfit for his profession. The nature of the offence clearly is material, for it cannot be that every violation of the criminal law implies a defect of character which unfits the offender to be a member of the profession. The general rule was stated by Lord Esher MR in 
Re Weare, A Solicitor
 
[1893] 2 QB 439
 at p 445 in the following terms: 
 
Where a man has been convicted of a criminal offence, that prima facie at all events does make him a person unfit to be a member of the honourable profession. That must not be carried to the length of saying that wherever a solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence the court is bound to strike him off the roll. ... the court [has] a discretion and must inquire into what kind of a crime it is of which he has been convicted, and the court may punish him to a less extent than if he had not been punished in the criminal proceeding.
 
 
 
Although the offence need not be one involving money (see, eg 
Re Cooper
 
[1898] 67 LJQB 276
), it has been said that it must be of such a character that it is expedient for the protection of the public and the preservation of the good name of the profession to remove the solicitor from the roll or from practice: 
Re Knight Glenn Jeyasingam
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 531
  at p 537.
In addition to considering the nature of the offence and whether it implies a defect of character, etc, there is some support for the view that the question whether or not the conviction taken widely (including the penalty imposed) implies a defect of character is relevant: see Tan Yock Lin, 
 The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia 
 (2nd Ed, 1998), at p 782. The underlying rationale is that the nature of the offence, though important, is not and cannot be, conclusive since an offence may range over a multitude of different circumstances, from the serious to the relatively condonable. This proposition was illustrated in 
Re A Solicitor
 
[1960] 2 QB 212
[1960] 2 All ER 621
, where an English solicitor was struck off the roll after his conviction in 1959 for insulting behaviour whereby a breach of the peace was occasioned. He had received the maximum sentence possible for that offence and it transpired that he had also previously been suspended from practice for two years after his conviction in 1956 on two charges of indecent assault. The Divisional Court was prepared to suppose, as there was no finding of what exactly the solicitor had done, that the 1959 offence might have been something relatively condonable as, for example, quarrelling with a taxi driver over the fare. However, seeing that the maximum penalty had been levied the court was assuaged in its doubt as to whether the conviction pointed to conduct unbefitting a solicitor. If then the penalty as well as the nature of the offence must be looked at in determining whether the conviction is unbefitting a solicitor, then a fortiori in determining whether the conviction unfits a person to be a solicitor: see also the judgment of Lord Parker CJ in the same case at 
[1960] 2 QB 212
, 218; [1960] 2 All ER 621, 622.
In 
Re Ratnam Isaac Paul
 
 SLR 486 
 
[1973] 2 MLJ 54
 , the High Court took the view that the nature of the offence was the sole criterion in determining due cause under the then s 84(2)(a) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed) (now s 83(2)(a)). On final appeal to the Privy Council [1975-1976] SLR 39; 
[1976] 1 MLJ 195
, the criminal conduct was shown to be relevant under the circumstances to s 84(2)(b) (now s 83(2)(b)) rather than s 84(2)(a) (s 83(2)(a)), but the remarks of Lord Simon of Glaisdale (at [1975-1976] SLR 39, 52; 
[1976] 1 MLJ 195
, 201, albeit obiter, are useful: 
 
The appellant had argued before the High Court that, on the facts and having regard to all the circumstances, his conviction could not be said to imply a defect of character making him unfit for his profession within s 82(2)(a) [sic] of the [Act]. The High Court held that the nature of the offence is the sole criterion in determining whether or not an advocate and solicitor comes within the provisions and that the offence in question was one which clearly implied such a defect of character in the appellant. This construction of the statutory provision by the High Court, and the conclusion therefrom, were barely controverted before their Lordships. On the view which their Lordships have taken, the appellant`s conviction (or, more importantly, the admitted conduct which led to such conviction), was relevant under the circumstances to s 84(2)(b) rather than (a). But, did the matter fall for necessary decision, their Lordships would be in no way disposed to disagree with the construction adopted by the High Court. Of course, the mere `nature` of the offence will often be of little guidance to the moral obliquity actually involved. But it is in the penalty that the court will have regard to the moral obliquity.
 
 
 
It should be pointed out that in referring to the penalty Lord Simon was thinking of the penalty imposed on the offender in relation to his conviction and not of the penalty, so to speak, to be inflicted by a show cause court in disciplinary proceedings. But in 
Re Chen Chung Ying Winston
 
 
[1988] SLR 946
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 340
 , the High Court thought that the penalty meant that penalty imposed by a show cause court and understood the moral obliquity of an offence to be material only at the disciplinary `penalty` stage. Wee Chong Jin CJ said at 
[1988] SLR 946
, 959; 
[1989] 1 MLJ 340
, 348: 
 
An analysis of their Lordships` observations in that case [a reference to Ratnam, supra] reveals two points:
 
 
 
 
(1) we must first look at the nature of the offence, which is the sole criterion in determining whether or not an advocate and solicitor comes within s 80(2)(a) [s 83(2)(a)] of the Legal Profession Act; 
 
(2) if we decide that the offence implies a defect of character making the advocate and solicitor unfit for his profession, we then have to determine which of the three penalties is the appropriate one. It is at this stage that we have regard to the moral obliquity actually involved, and this could encompass the conduct leading to such conviction.
  
 
 
The due cause which is constituted by conviction of an offence unfitting the offender to be a member of the profession looks not at the capacity in which the offender committed the offence, nor at the capacity in which he was convicted of the offence. Whether or not the offence was committed in a professional capacity is irrelevant because the due cause is based on the nature of the offence committed, as was held in 
Re Jeyaretnam JB
 
 
[1988] SLR 195
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 353
 . (See also 
 Re Knight Glenn Jeyasingam 
, supra, where the court refused to regard the fact that an offence was not committed in one`s capacity as an advocate and solicitor as relevant in mitigation.) Thus, in 
 Re Weare 
, supra, Lord Esher MR, responding to an argument that the court had no authority to strike a solicitor off the roll if the offence he had committed had not occurred in his capacity as solicitor, stated succinctly (at p 442 of the report): 
 
That would seem to me to be a very strange doctrine if it were true - that a person convicted of a crime, however horrible, must, if it be not connected with his professional character, be allowed by the court still to be a member of a profession which ought to be free from all suspicion.
 
 
 
(See also 
Re Daly
 
[1896] 17 LR (NSW) 19
.) Contrariwise, it appears that if the offence was committed by the offender in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor, that is an aggravating factor which the court is entitled to take into account: 
 Re Mohomed Jiffry Muljee 
, supra at p 523 and 
 Law Society of Singapore v Narmal Singh 
, supra at p 186.
Next, the fact that s 83(2)(a) adds as a condition that the offence must unfit an advocate and solicitor to be one creates a particular difficulty common to many of the provisions in s 83(2), namely, the difficulty of ascertaining the standard of judgment to be applied in a scrutiny of the misconduct. For instance, if an advocate and solicitor is convicted of the offence of tax evasion, that may nevertheless be a matter which persons who, in their private affairs are altogether rightminded, may regard as not particularly immoral and merely venial. However, a body of reasonable advocates and solicitors or a judge may well feel greater moral repugnance in the appraisal of such conduct. What standard to be applied will be determinative of the case, and the wording in s 83(2)(a) for all its seeming objectivity cannot fail to escape this difficulty. The English authorities espouse the standard of peer judgment (see, eg 
Allinson v General Council of Medical Education & Registration
 
[1894] 1 QB 750
), but these are distinguishable on the ground that the determination in those cases was final and not appealable. In Singapore there is no right of appeal but the disciplinary punishment is determined by a court in show cause proceedings, and, since the show cause court is not bound by the standards of the disciplinary committee, the same argument is in principle applicable: Tan Yock Lin, 
 The Law of Advocates and Solicitors 
, supra at pp 784 and 793. The learned author therefore suggests that the proper standard of judgment is not that which would commend itself to a body of reasonable advocates and solicitors but is that which is fixed by the court.We are disposed to think that this is the correct view.
In the final analysis, we found it useful to bear in mind that disciplinary action under s 83 of the Act serves three functions, namely, (a) punishment of the errant solicitor for his misconduct; (b) deterrence against similar defaults by other like-minded solicitors in the future; and (c) protection of public confidence in the administration of justice: see 
Law Society of Singapore v Lau See-Jin Jeffrey
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 215
  at p 227. In this respect, the dicta of the High Court in 
Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 696
  at pp 699-700 was worth repeating: 
 
 
11 ... It is not simply a question of punishing the solicitor concerned. A further consideration must be what course should the court take to protect the public and to register its disapproval of the conduct of the solicitor. In the relevant sense, the protection of the public is not confined to the protection of the public against further default by the solicitor in question. It extends also to the protection of the public against similar defaults by other solicitors through the court publicly marking the seriousness of what the instant solicitor has done. The orders made must therefore accord with the seriousness of the default and leave no doubt as to the standards to be observed by other practitioners. In short, the orders made should not only have a punitive but also a deterrent effect. 
 
12 There are also the interests of the honourable profession to which the solicitor belongs, and those of the courts themselves, to consider. The administration of justice can only proceed on the basis that solicitors can place reliance upon the honesty of the solicitors with whom they deal. The public too must be able to repose confidence in a profession which plays so indispensable a part in the administration of justice. Similarly, the courts of this country must be able to depend on the honesty and integrity of all practitioner appearing before them and to expect that they will maintain the highest standards of personal honesty and integrity in their dealings with the courts.
  
 
 
The court in 
 Lau See-Jin Jeffrey 
 (supra) also approved the approach of the court in 
 Ravindra Samuel 
 (supra), which had in turn approved of dicta in the English case of 
Bolton v Law Society
 
[1994] 2 All ER 486
 to the effect that a solicitor will almost invariably be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors where the charge against him involves proven dishonesty. If a solicitor has not acted dishonestly, but is shown to have fallen below the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness, he will nonetheless be struck off the roll, as opposed to merely being suspended, if his lapse is such as to indicate that he lacks the qualities of character and trustworthiness which are the necessary attributes of a person entrusted with the responsibilities of a legal practitioner:

 The appropriate order 
 
 
 
Before the Disciplinary Committee, counsel for the respondent accepted that the respondent`s conviction was final and conclusive by virtue of s 83(6) of the Act. However, he submitted that, on the facts, the proper determination should be that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 83 of the Act, but that, while no such cause existed, the respondent should be reprimanded in accordance with s 93(1)(b) of the Act. By way of mitigation, counsel submitted that the respondent had derived no financial benefit from the conduct which led to his conviction, beyond having earned the usual conveyancing fees. His only role had been `to assist in a stop-gap measure to enable a foreigner to own landed property`. What he had done amounted to no more than an error of judgment. His offence was `technical`, and his lapse of judgment an isolated one, in the course of an 18-year career.
In the judgment of the Committee, the offence of which the respondent was convicted implied a defect of character which rendered him unfit for his profession. He had acted for Ang, the nominee of Lim, a `foreign person` in the intended purchase of `residential property` within the meaning of the RPA. He had even prepared a trust deed in order to give effect to a scheme to deceive the Controller of Residential Property. It was clear that he knew exactly what he was doing. Counsel for the Law Society submitted that the respondent, as an advocate and solicitor, was bound to uphold the law of the land. He had after all taken an oath to that effect. Our statutes were enacted for particular purposes; the provisions of the RPA were designed to prevent certain property from being owned by foreign persons, and the respondent had intentionally set out to assist his client, a `foreign person`, to commit a breach of s 3(1)(c) of the RPA. The Committee concurred with the submissions of counsel for the Law Society, and in the result found that the charge against the respondent was proved, and that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 93(1)(c) of the Act.
We now turn to the question of the appropriate order to be made. To recapitulate, the nature of the offence, whilst crucial, was not the only relevant consideration - the penalty imposed upon conviction thereof, as indicative of the moral turpitude or obliquity involved, was also to be taken into account. Further or in the alternative, the degree of moral blameworthiness was also to be weighed in the balance in deciding the appropriate penalty to be imposed in the disciplinary proceedings. Finally, and this was decisive in the instant context - striking off would invariably follow where the solicitor is shown not only to have acted dishonestly, but also where he has fallen short of the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness.
It was the considered opinion of this court that the offence for which the respondent was convicted was one involving dishonesty, and was not merely `technical` in nature, as the counsel for the respondent had argued. It was dishonest because it was tantamount to the commission of a fraud on the authorities - abetting the attempted purchase by a `foreign person` of `residential property` in contravention of the provisions of the RPA was an intentional circumvention of laws which, for good reasons, the legislature had seen fit to enact, laws which, as counsel for the Law Society pointed out, it was the duty of the respondent as an advocate and solicitor to uphold. The respondent may well have made an error of judgment, and that error may well have been isolated one, as counsel submitted. But in reply, it might be said not only was it an error the seriousness of which should not be underestimated, it was also one which the respondent, an advocate and solicitor of some 18 years` standing, should have known better than to commit. Before us, the respondent reiterated that he had not benefited from his misdeeds apart from having earned the usual conveyancing fees. He also pleaded in mitigation that he had not renewed his practising certificate which expired in March this year, and regretted what he had done. This may very well have been so, but in our view, it was besides the point. Because orders made by a disciplinary tribunal are not primarily punitive, considerations which would ordinarily weigh in mitigation of punishment have less effect on the exercise of the disciplinary jurisdiction than on sentences imposed in criminal cases: 
Bolton v Law Society
 
[1994] 2 All ER 486
 at p 492. To state the matter another way, whatever might have been the appropriate sentence in the criminal proceedings, the objective there was rather different from that in show cause proceedings, which are civil and not punitive in nature. As Tan, 
 The Law of Advocates and Solicitors 
, supra put it at pp 766-767: 
 
The correct view is that striking off the roll and suspension from practice fulfil different functions from that of criminal sanctions. A solicitor whose name is on the roll is publicly held out as a person to whom a member of the public may entrust his private confidences, his business affairs and his liberty on the basis that the solicitor is grounded in the law and will not undertake work where his private interests will be in conflict with his client`s interests. It follows that the purpose of the disciplinary proceedings is to ascertain whether the solicitor is still fit to be so held out by the court.
 
 
 
In any event, the weight to be attached to a plea in mitigation is virtually negligible where the case is one involving proven dishonesty, as striking off will be the consequence as a matter of course.
Examples of offences which imply a defect of character unfitting an advocate and solicitor to be a member of the profession are wide-ranging, and the cases are legion in which advocates and solicitors have been struck off the roll or suspended from practice after convictions of offences involving dishonesty and fraud: see, eg 
Law Society of Singapore v VCS Vardan

, supra (pocketing $2,416.35 professional fees from a client due to his firm and writing a false attendance note stating that the client confirmed that he had yet to pay the money owed - convicted of two counts of grossly improper conduct under s 83(2)(b) of the Act);

, supra (convicted of four charges of conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust and two charges of conspiracy to cheat - sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment on each of the six charges with two of these charges to run consecutively);

, supra (convicted of four charges of corruptly offering and receiving gratification, criminal breach of trust - sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment and a fine of $5,000); and 
 Law Society of Singapore v Narayanan 
, supra (convicted on two charges under s 131(1) of the then Companies Act (Cap 185) - making a personal profit out of transactions at the expense of the company of which he was the chairman).
It has already been noted that the offence in the present case was one with an element of dishonesty. The gravity of the offence was also compounded by the fact that the respondent had committed it in his professional capacity as an advocate and solicitor, and had abused his position as a member of a respected and honourable profession. In this respect, the dicta of the court in 
 Re Knight Glenn Jeyasingam 
, supra at p 537 of the report are of especial pertinence: 
 
[I]n our view, in any case where the court is bound to consider the appropriate order to be made in respect of an advocate and solicitor convicted of a criminal offence - particularly one involving dishonesty - the paramount considerations must be the protection of the public and the preservation of the good name of the profession. Certainly the court will give its consideration to the mitigating circumstances in each individual case but it can do so only so far as is consistent with the above two related objectives.
 
 
 
In the premises, taking into account the foregoing considerations, we had no hesitation in ordering that the respondent be struck off the roll. If this seemed somewhat harsh, it was only necessary to quote the remarks of the Law Society of the United Kingdom in its 
 Guide to the Professional Conduct of Solicitors 
 (1990 Ed) at p 177: 
 
If the need to protect the good name of the profession ultimately causes hardship to an individual whose misconduct has led to his being struck off, it has to be accepted as the price of maintaining the reputation of the profession and the public confidence in it.

Whether court can impose punishment for criminal act yet to be committed

s 42(11) Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158)
 
The respondents were charged in the court below, on a private summons, with the following offence: 
 
You Grandfield Investment International Pte Ltd [ROC No 199206232W] are charged that you were at all material times the subsidiary proprietor of Unit Nos [num ]02-01 to [num ]02-11 which are lots within the control and management of the Management Strata Title Plan No 593 (Delta House) (hereinafter called `Management Corporation`), pursuant to the provisions of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158), and notwithstanding that the Management Corporation had given to you written demand dated 16 February 1998 to pay up all the arrears of contributions and interest due from you to the said Management Corporation, which arrears were overdue by at least 30 days before 16 February 1998, you have failed to pay the said arrears within 14 days of service of the said written demand, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 42(11) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158).
 
 
 
On 23 June 1999, the respondents pleaded guilty to the charge and were sentenced by the district judge to a fine of $3,000 with a further order that the respondents pay to the appellants all the outstanding arrears. At the time of the appeal, the respondents had since paid the fine but all of the outstanding arrears remained unsettled.
The appellants appealed against a particular aspect of the sentence, namely, the district judge`s refusal to order a further fine for future default in the payment of the contributions and interest. The issue raised in this appeal rested essentially on the interpretation of s 42(11) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158) (`LTSA`), which is set out as follows: 
 
A subsidiary proprietor who fails to pay any contribution or interest due and owing to a management corporation within 14 days from the date of service of the written demand referred to in subsection (10) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 and
 to a further fine not exceeding $100 for every day during which the contribution or interest remains unpaid after conviction
 and the court before which such conviction is had may, in addition to such fine, order the subsidiary proprietor to pay to the management corporation the amount of any contribution together with any interest due thereon or any interest certified by the management corporation to be due from such person at the date of his conviction and such amount may be recovered according to any written law for the time being in force for the recovery of fines. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
 
 
 The decision below 
 
 
 
 
 
In the court below, the district judge rejected the appellants` request for a further fine to be fixed for a continuing offence. He was of the opinion that it was inappropriate to sentence someone before the offence has been committed and on the present facts, the liability could only crystallise into an actual punishable offence upon default by the respondents, which would have to be
 after 
the date of conviction. He further held that imposing the sentence prior to the commission of the continuing offence not only meant that the court would, at the time of sentencing, have no means of determining the actual length of default, it also amounted to the accused being deprived of his right of mitigation and the opportunity to give his reasons, if any, for the default. The district judge concluded that Parliament could not have intended such an interpretation that would lead to unjust results.
The district judge held that a further fine could only be imposed after it was shown that the respondents had continued to fail to pay the contributions and interest 
 after 
 the date of conviction. In such an event, it would then be open to the appellants to lodge a further complaint and apply for a fresh summons against the respondents for the continuing default.
 The appellants` arguments 
 
 
 
It was argued by the appellants that the district judge had erred in law and in fact when he failed to give effect to the plain and literal meaning of the words in s 42(11), LTSA, which, they submitted, compelled the judge to impose the further fine as part of the sentences to be meted out for an offence under the section. It was contended that the words `and to a further fine not exceeding $100 for every day during which the contribution or interest remains unpaid after conviction` were mandatory in nature and therefore the court was bound to impose the further fine at the time of conviction of the respondents.
The appellants further sought to rely on what they interpreted to be the Parliament`s intention in introducing s 42(11), LTSA, in 1987. They submitted that the intention of the Parliament was to strengthen the position of the management corporation against recalcitrant subsidiary proprietors and this would be given effect to by reading the relevant words as being mandatory in nature. 
 
`... and to a further fine ...`
 
 
 
Contrary to what was alleged by the appellants, it is not uncommon to find in our legislation provisions for the imposition of further penalties upon the continual commission of an offence. The expression or its equivalent `... and to a further fine not exceeding $x for every day during which the offence continues after conviction ...` can be found employed in many of our local statutes. To name a few examples, one may wish to look at s 8(6), HUDC Housing Estates Act (Cap 131), ss 5(3) and 23(3) of the Building Control Act (Cap 29) and s 23(4) of the Public Utilities Act (Cap 261). The exact wording may differ slightly between the different legislation and, although s 42(11) LTSA is not expressly worded as providing for a continuing offence`, I had no doubt that the words were clearly intended to deal with such a situation.
It was pointed out by both counsel, for the appellants and the respondents, that there was currently a lack of local authority determining the question of whether a court may impose a fine in futuro for continuing offences that have yet to be committed. However, this issue has been settled by several Malaysian authorities. The legal position there is that a sentence for a continuing offence can only be imposed after it has been proved that the offence has been continued. In 
R v Lim Heng Soon & Ors
 
 
[1954] MLJ 151
 , the facts in brief were that the accused persons were found guilty of the offence of disobeying a nuisance order and a daily-rated fine was imposed upon them for future continued non-compliance with the order. This was in fact an in futuro fine since it was for breaches of law (ie continued non-compliance) which the accused persons had not yet committed. The appellate court exercised its revisionary powers to, inter alia, set aside the order imposing the fines and held that `fines for a continuing offence can be imposed only after proof that the offence has continued` and the court was the only authority who could determine the issue of whether or not the offence had in fact continued.
The case of 
Taiping Town Council v Beh Cheng Siew
 
 
[1955] MLJ 102
  also dealt with the non-compliance of an order and a statutory provision imposing a further penalty for continuing the offence. The unequivocal position taken by the Malaysian court in that case was that a man cannot be punished for an offence which he has not committed. If the offence was indeed continued, then the proper procedure would be to prosecute the offender again under a fresh charge for continuing the offence. The court there recognised the same problems of imposing an in futuro fine as was identified by the district judge in our present case. In the absence of fresh proceedings for the subsequent charge, it would not be possible for the court to determine how long the default had gone on and whether the accused had acquired some perfectly valid reasons for the continued default that were not previously available to him at the time of the initial conviction. These factors would be relevant in determining what daily rate of fine should be fixed with respect to the continued offence. This proper procedure of bringing a fresh charge for continued default was reiterated in the case of 
Meow Loong Onn v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 MLJ 612
 .
I was in total agreement with the position established by the Malaysian courts and the reasoning adopted by the district judge. There was no question that the arguments raised by the appellants must inevitably fail. It is a fundamental principle in criminal law that an offender can only be punished for an offence with which he was charged and of which he was convicted. To sentence an offender in advance, for a criminal act yet to be committed, would be going completely against all jurisprudential theory, either of the common law or the civil code. A statutory provision such as that of s 42(11) of the LTSA creates, at the time of conviction, a liability for continuing the offence. However, this liability will only be crystallised subsequently, when it has actually been proven that the default has continued after the time of conviction.
 Calculation of amount of further fine 
 
 
 
The appellants had sought to suggest that the problem of indeterminate length of default with respect to the imposition of in futuro fines was not a real one, as the whole purpose of imposing a further fine was to compel the offender to pay up the arrears as early as possible, to minimise the further penalties that would be incurred. They went on to submit that the respondents were in a position to mathematically calculate the period of delay and the total amount of further fine incurred since they were the ones who could fix the length of default by determining when they would pay up all the arrears. I found the reasoning behind such an argument clearly faulty and unacceptable. The reality is that the fact of the offender being able to `control` the length of default does not assist the court, at the time of conviction and prior to the commission of any further continued offence, in determining the culpability of the offender and whether a lenient or deterrent rate of fine should be fixed in light of circumstances which have not arisen yet. It is crucial for the sentencing court to be able to establish at the time of sentencing, a precise calculation of the exact amount of fine to be imposed and which may be enforced against the offender. This would be impossible if the arguments forwarded by the appellants were to be accepted by this court. Furthermore, I was fully prepared to recognise that there could be good reasons leading to the continuation of the default and such factors must be taken into account by the sentencing court as an accused should not be unjustly deprived of his right of mitigation.
 Parliament`s intention 
 
 
 
The amendments in 1987 to the LTSA, which introduced s 42(11), then numbered as s 39(11), were intended by Parliament to deal with, among others, the problems encountered by management corporations in the management and maintenance of the property. The appellants were probably not wrong in suggesting that the purpose of imposing such further penalty was designed to help strengthen the position of the management corporation against recalcitrant subsidiary proprietors. However, this still would not lead to the conclusion that the further penalty must then be imposed alongside the primary fine at the time of conviction, before the offence of continued default had even taken place. Similarly, with regard to the interpretations adopted by textbook writers of s 42(11), LTSA, the extracts cited by the appellants merely showed a reiteration of the wording used in the section and did not go any further to suggest that the proper time to impose the further penalty was at the time of the initial conviction.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
Having considered the legal principles governing the interpretation of such wording in statutory provisions dealing with further penalties, I was convinced that the appellants had misconstrued s 42(11) LTSA, and accordingly the appeal was dismissed.

Relevant consideration
 
The respondent in the divorce petition appealed against the decision of the district judge, Mr Khoo Oon Soo (`the learned district judge`), on weekend access, division of matrimonial assets and maintenance for the petitioner. I dismissed the appeal. The respondent has appealed to the Court of Appeal. I now give my reasons. To avoid confusion, I shall refer to the respondent as the respondent although he was the appellant in the proceedings before me. For the same reason I will refer to the respondent to the appeal before me as the petitioner.
 The background 
 
 
 
The petitioner is a Norwegian. She is now a permanent resident of Singapore. The respondent is a Singaporean. They were married in Oslo, Norway on 11 July 1980. After the marriage, the couple lived in various places, including Oslo in an apartment belonging to the petitioner, and finally at Apartment Block 253, Bishan Street 22, [num ]03-418, Singapore 570253 (`the flat`).
They have two sons; Jean Gilbert Louis born on 20 September 1980 (`Jean`) and Louis Glen Michael born on 30 April 1985 (`Glen`).
On 10 February 1998, the petitioner petitioned for divorce and ancillary reliefs on grounds of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the respondent.
A decree nisi was granted on 24 March 1998 with the application for ancillary reliefs adjourned for hearing in chambers.
The petitioner`s application for ancillary reliefs came up for hearing before the learned district judge in chambers on 21 April 1999. They were for: 
(i) joint custody of the two sons with care and control to the respondent; and reasonable access to the petitioner; 
(ii) division of matrimonial assets; 
(iii) maintenance for the petitioner; and 
(iv) costs of the proceedings
At the close of the hearing, the learned district judge made the following orders: 
 
 
(1) Custody, care and control of the two sons to respondent with access to petitioner as follows: 
 
(a) Weekend access: 
 
(i) for Jean (Saturday 8pm to Sunday 8pm); 
 
(ii) or Glen (Friday evening after school to Sunday 8pm). 
 
(b) Alternate holiday access. 
 
(c) 50% of school holidays with liberty to bring them overseas for holidays. Both parties to be sensible and sensitive with regard to the needs and feelings of both sons on access. 
 
(2) Matrimonial property: 
 
(a) Petitioner entitled to 35% of respondent`s CPF (Central Provident Fund) as of today (21 April 1999) less the CPF referred to below. 
 
(b) Flat to be valued at $440,000. petitioner to be entitled to 35% of the net value after deducting: 
 
(i) respondent`s CPF contributions and interest; 
 
(ii) outstanding HDB (Housing & Development Board) loan. respondent to pay petitioner this 35% within four months failing which the flat will be sold in the open market and distribution to be as stated above but to include deductions for legal costs and expenses.
  
 
 
Respondent to pay petitioner $8,000 lump sum maintenance.Respondent to pay costs fixed at $3,500.Liberty to apply.
 The appeal 
 
 
 
The respondent appealed against the orders of the learned district judge, contending that: 
(i) the weekend access granted to the petitioner to Glen should be reduced to Saturdays 8.00 pm to Sundays 8.00 pm or alternate Fridays 8.00 pm to Saturdays 8.00 pm; 
(ii) the award to the petitioner of 35% of the respondent`s CPF balance as at 21 April 1999 should be reduced to 20%; 
(iii) the award to the petitioner of 35% of the `net value` of the property as defined in the order of the learned district judge should be reduced to 20%; and 
(iv) there should be no order for maintenance for the petitioner.
 My decision 
 
 
 
On weekend access, at the hearing in the court below, the petitioner applied for joint custody of both sons. She agreed to the respondent having care and control of the two sons subject to the existing access being maintained. She wanted joint custody in order to have a say in their upbringing. She was then enjoying weekend access to the two sons from Friday evenings to Monday mornings. In addition, she applied for access on alternate public holidays, alternate Christmas holidays, 50% of school holidays with the right to take them overseas during her access period. The respondent only opposed the application for joint custody and the existing weekend access.
On his order on weekend access, the learned district judge in his grounds of decision stated: 
 
In respect of weekend access, I considered the fact that both sons are old enough to articulate their respective views and actual access with the petitioner. It is conceivable that both (especially Jean) would be able to inform their mother as to when weekend access would be convenient or otherwise. However, in terms of providing the legal framework for weekend access to avoid further acrimony I was of the view that as both sons are staying with the respondent, it would be more convenient for them to begin school from the respondent`s house on a Monday morning. That being the case I was of the view that weekend access for the petitioner [to Glen] should commence on Friday evenings after school (as was the existing arrangement) and continue until Sunday evenings at 8pm.`
 
 
 
I had not been persuaded that the two-day weekend access order in respect of Glen was wrong. The learned district judge had interviewed Glen before making the order. A full weekend access will give him more quality time with the petitioner who does not work on Saturdays. The order reducing the existing access so that it terminates on Sunday evenings is for Glen`s convenience. I therefore dismissed the respondent`s appeal against the learned district judge`s order on weekend access.
On division of matrimonial assets, the learned district judge found the pool of matrimonial assets to consist of the following: 
(i) the flat valued at $440,000 (less the outstanding balance of the HDB loan) and the respondent`s CPF withdrawals with interest; 
(ii) a balance of $126,000 in the CPF account of the respondent and $1,000 in that of the petitioner; and 
(iii) a car valued at $24,000.
The flat was purchased on 1 December 1990 for $130,100 plus some renovation costs. Payment was made by the respondent with withdrawal from his CPF account for the initial payment of $13,010 and a loan of $117,800 from the HDB. The loan is being repaid by monthly instalments of $872, the same being deducted from the respondent`s CPF account. As of 31 December 1998, the balance of HDB loan stood at $62,257.80. According to the respondent, he had utilised about $75,000 from his CPF account for the purchase of the flat.
Taking into account that the petitioner`s contributions were mainly indirect, the learned district judge awarded the petitioner 35% of the value less deduction for the balance of HDB loan and refund of the withdrawals from the respondent`s CPF account with interest. This was what the learned district judge stated in his grounds of decision: 
 
I considered the factors listed in s 112(2) of the Women`s Charter. It was clear to me, therefore, that the main consideration with regard to the matrimonial assets would be the petitioner`s indirect contribution. In this respect, I considered the fact that the marriage lasted 18 years and that she, at least, in the initial years, was the primary care giver for the children and was looking after the house. In addition, I also considered that the petitioner was helping the respondent in his various businesses. In particular, she gave $27,000 from the proceeds of her apartment in Norway to help the respondent in his business.
 
 
 
In 
Soh Chan Soon v Tan Choon Yock
 (Unreported) (reported in the 
 Academy of Law Digest 
 Issue No 14/98, pp 18-19), Warren LH Khoo J in dismissing the appeal by the husband against an award of 63% of the matrimonial flat to the wife stated that division of matrimonial assets is not a science. It is a judicial attempt to divide what was never intended to be divided. The legislature and the courts have formulated general guidelines, but it is possible for two judges each doing his or her honest best to come to two significantly different results and an appeal court should not interfere with the decision of a court of first instance unless it is so far out of line as to be perverse, or unless the lower court has clearly gone wrong on principle. Warren LH Khoo J also observed that generally, for the purpose of arriving at a just and fair division of the matrimonial assets, it is not particularly helpful to try to ascertain, sometimes in the face of conflicting evidence, the exact amount of money that each party has put in directly for the acquisition of the family home, as this ignores the indirect contributions, monetary and otherwise, most of which are incapable of any meaningful ascertainment either because no record was kept or because the nature of the contribution is irreducible into monetary terms. It is closer to reality to use as the starting point the assumption that both parties have contributed jointly and equally throughout the marriage to the acquisition and growth of the equity in the family home. Working out the exact amounts of direct monetary contributions would be worthwhile only in a case, for example, of a couple who has been married for a short time, with no children, each with independent means and who have not shared a household and its myriad responsibilities. An account can then be taken of other factors to tilt the balance one way or the other.
The petitioner`s contributions towards the acquisition of the matrimonial assets were mainly indirect. The marriage lasted 18 years. During this time, she was the main care giver to their two sons. She looked after the home. She contributed $27,000 being proceeds of sale of her apartment in Oslo to the respondent`s businesses in pubs and cafes. She also helped out in his pubs as a barmaid receiving $200 to $400 a month as follows: 
(i) Gilbert`s Pub (from 1985 to 1990 - for about 7-8 hours per day - about four times per week); 
(ii) Pepe`s Caf, (December 1992 to September 1996); and 
(iii) Terry`s Pub (from mid 1996 intermittently and from September 1996 to end 1996 on a full-time basis).
The respondent had not shown that the learned district judge`s decision was out of line as to be perverse or that it was clearly wrong on principle. I therefore dismissed his appeal against the learned district judge`s order on division of the flat.
On division of CPF savings acquired by the parties, the learned district judge found that the CPF monies comprised $126,000 in the respondent`s account and $1,000 in the petitioner`s account. He similarly made an award to the petitioner of 35% of the respondent`s CPF balance as at 21 April 1999 excluding the refund with interest into his CPF account of withdrawals made by the respondent for the purchase of the flat. The refund with interest is to be paid from the proceeds of sale of the flat. This was what the learned district judge stated: 
 
I considered that she should have 35% of the net value of the flat and the respondent`s CPF as of 21 April 1999. The cut-off date was necessary to demarcate the respondent`s future CPF funds after decree nisi as well as the refund from the sale, if it took place.
 
 
 
According to the respondent, he had utilised the sum of around $75,000 from his CPF account to pay for the flat. But the letter of 20 July 1998 from HDB gave the following particulars:
 
 
(a)
 
Name of lessee
 
Mr Pius Gilbert Louis ...
 
 
 
(d)
 
Initial deposit paid
 
$13,010 (CPF of lessee)
 
 
 
(e)
 
Current monthly instalment
 
$872 (CPF of lessee)
 
 
 
(f)
 
Outstanding loan as at 20 July 1998
 
$65,443.94
 
 
 
(g)
 
Original loan
 
$117,800 repayable over 15 years [commat] original monthly instalment $876 with effect from 1 Dec 90.
 
 
 
 
On the information supplied by HDB, the respondent has to date paid from his CPF account $13,010 for the initial payment and 104 monthly instalments, at least one of which was for the amount of $876, and the others $872 each. The total amount withdrawn from his CPF account would be in excess of $100,000. This sum with interest with have to be refunded from the proceeds of sale of the flat.
The refund with interest to the respondent`s CPF account is excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets for division although his CPF savings were acquired during the marriage principally from his employment as a teacher with the Singapore International School. The effective award to the petitioner therefore works out to less than 20% of the respondent`s CPF savings. The respondent also gets to keep the car worth $24,000 and some shares purchased with his CPF moneys. I was therefore not persuaded that the learned district judge`s award to the petitioner of 35% of the respondent`s CPF as at 21 April 1999 excluding the refund of his CPF withdrawals with interest should be reduced.
On maintenance, the petitioner wants a clean break. She asked for $10,800 as lump sum maintenance based on $300 per month for three years. She is 40 years old, currently working for AWARE (Association of Women for Action and Research) drawing a salary of $1,445 per month. The respondent, aged 48, is a talented professional musician, holder of a Teachers` Training College certificate and a diploma on hotel management from SHATEC. The petitioner on the other hand has only clerical skills. Taking into account the higher earning capacity of the respondent, the lump sum award of $8,000 is not excessive.
Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal with costs fixed at $850.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellant was convicted and sentenced to suffer the punishment of death by the High Court on the following charge: 
 
You, Chia Song Heng are charged that you on or about 1 December 1998, at or about 6.45pm, at Block 63 Kallang Bahru [num ]10-439, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, two plastic packets and nineteen sachets containing not less than 87.78g of diamorphine at the aforesaid place without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
He appealed against the conviction and sentence. We heard the appeal on 16 August 1999 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
 The facts 
 
 
 
On 1 December 1998 at about 4.40pm, Sgt Lim Eng Poh (Sgt Lim) and a team of CNB officers received instructions to trail a white pick-up bearing the registration no GH 7920Z, which was travelling along Geylang Road towards the City. About five minutes later, the team intercepted the pick-up along Geylang Road beside Ghim Peng Hotel. The driver of the vehicle was the appellant. There was a female passenger, Ng Lian Hua, seated next to him. Both of them were arrested.
Amongst the articles seized from the pick-up were two bunches of keys. One was a bunch of 11 keys and the other a bunch of six keys. One of the keys in the second bunch was inserted in the pick-up ignition.
Shortly thereafter, at about 5.03pm, Woman Insp Karen Leong (W/Insp Leong) arrived at the scene with her team and Sgt Lim handed the appellant and Ng Lian Hua, together with the exhibits, over to her. Both of them were brought by W/Insp Leong to the Macdonald`s car park at Stadium Walk. There they met up with Woman Insp Cindy Goh (W/Insp Goh) who was leading a third team of officers. One of the men with W/Insp Goh was S/Sgt Tai Kwong Yong (S/Sgt Tai).
From the two bunches of keys seized, the appellant identified the keys to his rented flat at Block 219 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 [num ]08-825 (`the Ang Mo Kio` flat) and Ng Lian Hua`s rented flat at Block 63 Kallang Bahru [num ]10-439 (`the Kallang Bahru flat`). The appellant also revealed to S/Sgt Tai that there were two bundles of the `thing` at the Kallang Bahru flat. But he added that Ng Lian Hua did not know the existence of the `thing` at her flat.
At about 6.35pm, the appellant and Ng Lian Hua were brought by W/Insp Leong and her team to the Kallang Bahru flat. W/Insp Goh and her team followed in a separate car. S/Sgt Tai opened the door of the flat with the keys identified by the appellant. W/Insp Goh`s team went into the flat while W/Insp Leong and her team stayed outside the front door.
In the living room of the flat, W/Insp Goh asked the appellant and Ng Lian Hua where was the `Pei Hun` (white powder). Ng Lian Hua said she did not know. However, the appellant pointed to the bedroom near the kitchen. W/Insp Goh and S/Sgt Tai followed the appellant to the bedroom where the appellant pointed to a corner beside the cupboard. S/Sgt Tai found a cardboard box which contained, amongst other things, one red plastic bag and a tissue box. To a question by W/Insp Goh as to how much was in the red plastic bag, the appellant said `19` and further added that `below the bed still have`. Following that S/Sgt Tai retrieved an envelope of `Erimin` tablets. Then the appellant said that there were some more at the dressing table. When asked `how much?` he answered `two`. S/Sgt Tai then checked the dressing table and found a tea-set box which contained a white plastic bag and a newspaper bundle. S/Sgt Tai also checked behind the bed headrest and found another white plastic bag which contained numerous plastic sachets.
All the questions posted by W/Insp Goh and the answers of the appellant were in Hokkien and were recorded in her pocket-book. The recording was signed by both W/Insp Goh and the appellant. At the trial, counsel for the accused (the appellant) did not object to the admission in evidence of the recordings made by W/Insp Goh in the pocket-book.
The following were the things, among others, found in the red plastic bag, the tissue box and the tea-set box: 
(i) Red plastic bag 
a yellow plastic bag containing a newspaper bundle wherein there were empty plastic sachets. 
b a pink plastic bag containing empty plastic sachets. 
c a Tanita digital weighing scale. 
(ii) Tissue box 
 A pink plastic bag containing a total of 19 sachets of granular substances. 
(iii) Tea-set box 
a a white plastic bag containing a packet of rocky (granular) substance and some empty plastic sachets. 
b a newspaper bundle containing a plastic packet of rocky (granular) substance.
Besides the Tanita digital weighing scale, other paraphernalia found in the flat included lighters, a pick, pincers, a roll of masking tape, a pair of scissors and aluminium paper.
At about 7.05pm, the Investigating Officer Anthony Low (IO Low) and his team arrived at the flat and took over the investigations.
On the following day, 2 December 1998, at about 12.35am, the appellant was taken by CNB officers to his Ang Mo Kio flat where a search was carried out. Only some Erimin tablets were found.
The granular substances seized at the Kallang Bahru flat were analysed by Dr Saw Chwee Guan (Dr Saw), a scientific officer in the Department of Scientific Services. His report showed the following: 
(i) the 19 plastic sachets from the tissue box contained 134.9g of granular substance, with a net weight of 12.60g of diamorphine. The substance contained 9.3% purity of diamorphine; 
(ii) the plastic packet (from the bundle of newspapers in the tea-set box) contained 455.1g of rocky (granular) substance, with a net weight of 37.82g of diamorphine. The substance contained 8.3% purity of diamorphine; 
(iii) the packet of rocky substance (from the white plastic bag in the tea-set box) contained 451.8g of rocky (granular) substance, with a net weight of 37.36g of diamorphine. The substance contained 8.2% purity of diamorphine.
In total, the diamorphine content of all the granular substances amounted to 87.78g, which formed the subject of the charge against the appellant.
 Consumption of drugs by the appellant 
 
 
 
Soon after his arrest on 2 December 1998 urine samples were taken from the appellant. Analysis of the urine samples showed that he had been consuming diamorphine before his arrest. On the same day the appellant was referred to Changi Prison Hospital for drug withdrawal symptoms. He was examined by Dr Leow Kee Fong (Dr Leow), the registrar of the hospital. The credentials of Dr Leow as an expert were not in question. He has often testified before the High Court in drug-related cases. In his medical report he stated that the appellant `clinically showed mild heroin withdrawal symptoms`. The report also noted that the appellant was observed in the ward and his condition had improved. He was discharged from the hospital on 4 December 1998.
Dr Leow further elaborated in court as to the signs of drug withdrawal which he found on the appellant. 
(i) On 2 December 1998, he examined the appellant upon the latter`s complaint of `uncomfortable feeling, giddiness, nausea and vomiting for three times`. He found the following visible clinical signs of drug withdrawal syndrome: sleepiness, mild running nose and tearing. The appellant also had `goose flesh`. He was otherwise normal. 
(ii) On 3 December 1998, although the appellant complained that he had vomited two to three times, and felt giddy, Dr Leow found that clinically the appellant had no visible signs of drug withdrawal syndrome. 
(iii) On 4 December 1998, although the appellant complained that he had diarrhoea and vomited two times, felt giddy and had no appetite, Dr Leow again found that clinically he had no visible signs of a drug withdrawal syndrome.
In the view of Dr Leow, by 3 December 1998, the appellant no longer showed clinical signs of a drug withdrawal syndrome.
Although Dr Leow did not expressly opine that the appellant had made up false complaints of giddiness, diarrhoea and vormiting, he said that the hospital`s night record and the nurses in charge had not registered any such complaints. The nurses at the hospital were required to make one round a night and they had not received any complaint from the appellant of diarrhoea or vomiting. He also testified that there was no record of evidence of vormiting in the spittoon next to the appellant`s bed. Based on all the foregoing he concluded that the appellant was only suffering from a mild drug withdrawal syndrome. He was of the firm opinion that the drug withdrawal symptoms shown by the appellant could not be categorised as `moderate`.
Dr Leow explained that, where a person suffered from a condition of mild drug withdrawal, the symptoms and signs would last from three to four days, peaking within 24 hours to 48 hours of the last drug intake. But in a moderate drug withdrawal condition, the symptoms and signs would last up to seven days, normally peaking within 24 hours to 48 hours of the last drug intake, and sometimes up to 72 hours. From his knowledge and experience a drug addict who suffers from a mild drug withdrawal syndrome would normally have a drug consumption rate of between one to two straws a day and for one who suffers from a moderate drug withdrawal syndrome he would normally have a drug consumption rate of between three to five straws a day, but it could go up as high as 15 or 16 straws a day.
 Statements of the appellant 
 
 
 
On 4 December 1998, the appellant made a cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) in which he stated: 
 
The heroin belongs to me, I put the heroin in my girlfriend `Annie`s` flat. I did not tell her that I put the heroin in her flat. Annie is not a heroin addict and has no record. After I was arrested, I brought the CNB officers to Annie`s flat and told them where I kept the heroin. I pray for leniency.
 
 
 
On 7 December 1998, the appellant made a statement under s 121 of the CPC in which he admitted, inter alia, that soon after his arrest he told the CNB officers he had `two liaps` (lbs) of the `thing` at the Kallang Bahru flat. He also admitted that he pointed out the drugs and the 19 sachets found in the bedroom of the Kallang Bahru flat to the CNB officers.
On 8 December 1998, the appellant made another statement under s 121 of the CPC in which he admitted, inter alia, to purchasing the two `liaps` (lbs) of heroin that was found at the Kallang Bahru flat from one `Ah Beh`. He said he would then repack the heroin into sachets of 7.8g each by using the Tanita weighing scale in a hotel in Joo Chiat or at the Kallang Bahru flat when Ng Lian Hua was not present. He stated that he had just started selling the sachets and had sold only a few sachets a day to his friends, with each sachet being sold normally for $100. Ng Lian Hua was not aware of his drug activities.
Even though counsel for the defence did not challenge the voluntariness of any of the statements given by the appellant under s 121 or s 122(6) of the CPC, nevertheless, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh required the prosecution to lead evidence to show that each of the statements was voluntarily given. It was only after he was so satisfied, that the statements were admitted.
 Further evidence 
 
 
 
IO Low told the court that some of the paraphernalia discovered by CNB officers at the Kallang Bahru flat were for the purpose of trafficking in diamorphine. The Tanita weighing scale was for weighing the diamorphine and the plastic sachets were for packing it. The pick was to break up the rocky substance into granular substance before re-packing. The lighters were used to seal the sachets after diamorphine was put in them. The aluminium paper and the lighters were for consuming diamorphine by using the `chasing the dragon` method.
The prosecution submitted that in the light of the evidence of Dr Leow, that the appellant had only suffered a mild drug withdrawal syndrome, his rate of consumption did not support an argument that the 87.78g of diamorphine found in his possession was meant wholly or substantially for his own consumption. The quantity he would consume in a month would only be a small fraction of 87.78g.
 Decision below 
 
 
 
The prosecution`s case rested essentially on the appellant`s oral statements to W/Insp Goh which were recorded in her pocket-book, the statements taken from the appellant under s 122(6) and s 121 of CPC between 4 December and 8 December 1998, the evidence of Dr Leow and the presumptions under ss 5 and 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Ed) (MDA).
At the close of the prosecution`s case, the trial judge, having been satisfied that a prima facie case against the appellant had been made out, administered the standard allocution prescribed under s 189(2) of the CPC. The appellant chose to remain silent and did not call any witnesses in his defence. His counsel also declined, on his instructions, to make any submission.
Accordingly, the trial judge found the appellant guilty as charged and convicted and sentenced him according to law. In coming to his decision he found that the presumption of trafficking under ss 5 and 17 of the MDA had not been rebutted. He drew an adverse inference against the appellant from his failure to testify.
The trial judge also rejected the appellant`s evidence in his statement that he consumed one sachet a day (about 26 straws a day or 1.17g nett) as being self-serving. He accepted Dr Leow`s evidence that the appellant only suffered mild drug withdrawal symptoms. In fact the appellant told Dr Leow that he had consumed about two to three straws of diamorphine a day prior to his arrest. The trial judge pointed out that even if the appellant had consumed diamorphine at the rate of three straws daily (equivalent to 0.135g net of diamorphine), the appellant would be consuming only a very insignificant amount of the diamorphine in his possession over a period of one month. It would be just over 4g net (0.135g x 30 days). Allowing him this reasonable amount for his own consumption over a period of a month, there would still be a very substantial amount left in his possession for trafficking.
Hence, the trial judge concluded that the appellant had failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that a substantial portion of the diamorphine was for his own consumption. He did not accept the contention that the remaining amount of diamorphine, if any, that was not for the appellant`s consumption would be less than 15g, thereby reducing the charge to a non-capital one.
 Grounds of appeal 
 
 
 
The petition of appeal sets out four specific grounds: 
(i) that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the appellant had possessed the 87.78g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking; 
(ii) that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA had not been rebutted; 
(iii) that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in accepting Dr Leow`s evidence that the appellant only had mild heroin withdrawal symptoms after his arrest; and conversely, in failing to give due weight to the appellant`s s 121 statement that he consumed one sachet of diamorphine daily, and that most of the diamorphine found in his possession was for his own consumption; 
(iv) that the trial judge erred in law and in fact when he drew adverse inferences against the appellant on account of his failure to testify.
The appellant also generally alleged that the conviction was `against the weight of the evidence and the probability of the case`.
 Possession 
 
 
 
Before us, counsel for the appellant admitted that the appellant was in possession of the drugs. In counsel`s skeletal submission he stated the following: 
 
The appellant does not deny that he was in exclusive possession of ... 87.78g of diamorphine at Block 63 kallang Bahru [num ]10-439, Singapore. He appeals against the learned trial judge`s finding that he had not rebutted on the balance of probabilities the presumption under s 17 of the MDA that the possession of the said diamorphine was for the purpose of trafficking.
 
 
 
In any event there was ample evidence proving that the appellant had possession of the drugs. He told the CNB officers that there were drugs at the Kallang Bahru flat. He led the officers to the flat and pointed out to them specifically the places where he had hidden the drugs. It is immaterial that the appellant did not have exclusive access to the flat, as Ng Lian Hua also had access to the flat: see 
Sukur v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 221
  and 
Fun Seong Cheng v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 523
 . In any event the appellant had expressly stated in his s 122(6) statement that Ng Lian Hua had nothing to do with the drugs in the Kallang Bahru flat, and that she was unaware that drugs were kept there. So the fact that the appellant shared the flat with Ng Lian Hua was wholly immaterial.
 Rebuttal of presumption of trafficking 
 
 
 
This issue was the crux of the appeal. It encompasses all the first three grounds of the petition. Section 17 of the MDA provides that a person who is proved to have had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine is presumed to have had the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of the diamorphine was not for that purpose. Section 5(2) of the MDA provides that a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he is in possession of that drug for the purpose of trafficking. The combined effect of the two provisions is that, once possession of a controlled drug is proved, the person in possession would be presumed to be guilty of the offence of trafficking. Of course, it remains open to an accused to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the entire amount of drugs, or a substantial part thereof, is for his own consumption.
The s 17 presumption applies only if a person is proved (as opposed to presumed) to be in possession of a controlled drug ( 
Low Kok Wai v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 676
 ). In the present case, as far as possession was concerned, there was overwhelming evidence which proved that the appellant was in possession of the diamorphine.
Accordingly, the burden shifted onto the appellant to rebut the statutory presumption of trafficking on a balance of probabilities. However, the appellant chose not to testify or call any witnesses in his defence. There was no real effort to rebut the statutory presumptions of trafficking except for a faint attempt by the defence counsel to dispute Dr Leow`s evidence as to the appellant`s degree of drug addiction. Dr Leow`s evidence was that the appellant had, at the most, a consumption rate of three straws of diamorphine a day (in line with the condition of mild drug withdrawal). At this rate, the appellant would take 650 days to consume all the diamorphine found in his possession. The defence counsel`s submission, based on the appellant`s s 121 statement, was that the appellant consumed up to one sachet, or 26 straws of diamorphine, a day (in line with the condition of moderate drug withdrawal). This meant that he would have taken only about 75 days to consume all the diamorphine found in his possession, thus rebutting the presumption of trafficking on a balance of probabilities.
In cross-examination of Dr Leow, counsel for the defence suggested that Dr Leow`s medical observations of the appellant`s drug withdrawal syndrome were inconclusive and that Dr Leow had discharged the appellant prematurely. He argued that Dr Leow should have kept the appellant for further observation instead of discharging him on 4 December 1998. However, Dr Leow maintained his position that clinically there were no more signs of the appellant suffering from withdrawal symptoms upon his discharge from hospital. In his opinion it was a mild drug withdrawal case. Dr Leow`s evidence as to the rate of consumption of the appellant was not challenged.
In his grounds of decision the trial judge did consider the appellant`s s 121 statement where the latter said he consumed one sachet (the equivalent of 26 straws) of diamorphine a day. However, the trial judge disbelieved this portion of the appellant`s statement and instead accepted the evidence of Dr Leow that the appellant`s drug withdrawal symptoms were mild and that he was only consuming two to three straws of diamorphine daily. This was a finding of fact reached after the trial judge had heard Dr Leow and considered all the evidence. On the basis of this finding, a large portion of the 87.78g of diamorphine would not have been for the appellant`s own consumption but for trafficking. In our opinion, the trial judge was amply justified to conclude that the presumption of trafficking had not been rebutted on a balance of probabilities. All the more so when the appellant even failed to testify on his own behalf.
 Drawing of adverse inference from silence 
 
 
 
It is true that the trial judge did draw an adverse inference against the appellant for electing to remain silent when his defence was called. In 
Oh Laye Koh v PP
 (Unreported) , this court ruled that under s 196(2) of CPC: 
 
the trial judge (is) at liberty to draw any inferences as may appear proper from the failure of the appellant to give evidence on oath, including the ultimate adverse inference that the appellant (is) guilty of the offence charged.
 
 
 
In that case, this court also noted that what inferences were proper to be drawn from an accused`s silence would depend on the circumstances of the particular case, and it was a question to be decided by applying ordinary common sense. The court stated that `the process would (involve) the trial judge`s consideration of whether on the totality of the prosecution witnesses` evidence (as tested in cross-examination), together with any inference that could properly be drawn from the accused`s silence, the accused`s guilt could be established beyond reasonable doubt.`
In the present case, given the evidence which was led against the appellant, including his own statements which he did not challenge, it was reasonable for the trial judge to have expected him to proffer some explanation in court if he were truly innocent of the offence charged. The trial judge was, therefore, entitled to rely upon the appellant`s failure to testify to hold that it reinforced the prosecution`s case against him. In our opinion, the failure in turn diminished the weight which should be given to that portion of his statement where he stated that he consumed one sachet of the drug a day. It showed his lack of faith in his own case.
 Judgment 
 
 
 
In the light of the considerations set out above, we did not think that the appellant had raised any doubts in our minds as to the propriety of the finding of the trial judge. The evidence against him was overwhelming. There was therefore no reason for us to disturb the conviction. We accordingly dismissed the appeal.

(delivering the judgment of the court): This is an appeal by the Attorney General against a decision of the High Court holding the Government liable for injuries suffered by the respondent on account of an attack by a fellow inmate, Foo Jiang Kwang (Foo), with a chopper while both of them were on duty in the kitchen of Changi Prison.
The respondent commenced the action against both Foo and the Attorney General, representing the Government, in accordance with the Government Proceedings Act. Before the trial Foo died of an unrelated cause. His estate did not contest the claim. In any event, it appears that his estate was insolvent or barely solvent. The trial proceeded solely on the basis of whether the prison authorities had breached their duty of care owed to the respondent. At the conclusion thereof, the court found for the respondent and awarded him damages in the total sum of $318,000.
 Background 
 
 
 
On 23 November 1991 the respondent started to serve a three and a half year sentence at Changi Prison for a series of offences of housebreaking and theft. On 3 May 1993 he was assigned to work in the prison kitchen; that was his first day as a vegetable cutter. Prior to that, from February 1992, he had worked in the kitchen, but was only in charge of the tea-boys. As regards Foo, he had worked in the kitchen for nearly four months before the date of the incident.
On the evening of 2 May 1993, the day before the incident, there was an altercation in the prison dormitory involving a group of inmates (including Foo) watching a Chinese television programme and another group of inmates (including the respondent) who were making some noise at the rear. There would appear to have been an exchange of words between both groups. What exactly happened was not clear. But the altercation subsided. No one reported the matter to the prison authorities.
The next morning, 3 May 1993, both the respondent and Foo were scheduled for kitchen duty from 7am. They were to prepare lunch. The warder in charge of the lunch shift, Cpl Vincent Tan, escorted the inmates from their dormitory to the kitchen at 7am. As was the usual routine, the inmates collected their breakfast and then proceeded to their duty areas, where they ate their breakfast, after which they were to commence work.
At this juncture, it would be helpful to give a picture of the lay-out of the entire kitchen area. [A sketch plan, which was submitted to the court below, and reproduced at Schedule A has been omitted - Editor.] It will be seen that the kitchen is divided by a cement wall into two separate parts, the main kitchen and the annex. Because of the wall, an officer standing in the main kitchen would not be able to see what was happening in the annex and vice versa. The main kitchen was used for the preparation of ingredients as well as cooking. Due to space constraints the preparation of `dry` ingredients, such as the cutting of potatoes and onions had to take place in the annex. A person who wished to get from the main kitchen to the annex would have to exit at the door marked `C`, walk up the corridor and enter the annex through the door marked `E`, a distance of some 15 metres.
Ordinarily a truck would arrive at the prison between 8.30am and 9am to deliver `wet` rations such as meat and vegetables. Before the truck`s arrival the lunch shift inmates would prepare the `dry` rations in both the main kitchen and the annex.
Reverting to the events that morning, at about 7.25am an officer arrived at the kitchen and conducted the opening `muster`, which was essentially a head-count. He then left. Immediately after that, Cpl Vincent Tan issued knives and choppers to the inmates for them to do their work either in the main kitchen or in the annex. Cpl Vincent was the only officer supervising all the inmates in the entire kitchen area (including the annex) that morning. We would add that the record showed that on some days two officers were rostered for duty in the kitchen, depending on the availability of manpower and the requirements in other parts of the prison. That day, in fact, two warders were rostered for duty in the kitchen. However, a prison officer in the `condemned block` had reported sick that morning. So the second warder who was meant to be on duty in the kitchen was re-assigned for duty in the `condemned block` as it was thought that the need in the latter area was greater.
At about 8am the respondent was in the annex next to the water tank at the position marked `R` on the sketch plan. Foo came up to him with two choppers in his hands. He threw one chopper down in front of the respondent and challenged him to a fight. The respondent refused. Foo then began slashing the respondent with the chopper he was holding. A commotion ensued. Other inmates rushed to try and restrain the fight. One of them, Sunder, was even injured in the process.
At that moment a member of the prison staff, Warder Jeganathan, was passing through the kitchen area. He heard the commotion. He opened gate `B` (see sketch plan), locked it behind him and entered the corridor and walked towards the direction of the sound of the commotion. At that moment, the respondent came running towards him, covered in blood. A Malay inmate, a friend of Foo, was chasing the respondent with two choppers. Warder Jeganathan got between the respondent and the Malay inmate and managed to subdue the latter with a riot stick. The location at which he subdued the Malay inmate, was at point E. Foo had by then been subdued by other inmates.
Meanwhile, Cpl Vincent, who was in the `Halal` section of the kitchen (marked `V` on the sketch plan), heard the commotion and ran out into the corridor. By then, Warder Jeganathan was already at the entrance of the annex (between doors D and E on the sketch map). Apprehending that the melee was a gang fight, Cpl Vincent turned back into the kitchen and raised the alarm from a buttom outside the office. He then returned to the corridor, by which time everything was over. According to Cpl Vincent, there was a lapse of approximately 30 seconds from the moment he heard the commotion to the sounding of the alarm. Reinforcement also came following the alarm. The respondent was taken to the prison hospital for treatment.
On that morning, the senior officer who was responsible for the kitchen was Tan Seng Hin. He was then at another part of the prison. He rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. By the time he arrived, the situation was under control.
The respondent suffered severe injuries to his hands as a result of the attack. The trial judge found that his left hand is now practically non-functional, and he has only about 70% use of his right hand.
 Basis of claim 
 
 
 
The basis of the respondent`s claim was in negligence and/or breach of duty on the part of the prison authorities in supervising the inmates. The trial judge held that there was such a breach of duty and he concluded thus: 
 
34 ... It is my conclusion that in the circumstances which I have referred to, it was a breach of their duty of care for the prison authorities to allow the knives and choppers to be in the hands of the inmates when they were unsupervised, particularly in the light of a similar incident which had happened only a few months before. I think, on balance, one is justified in saying that the absence of supervision materially contributed to the severe injuries sustained by the plaintiff.
 
 
 
 
 
 Issues on appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
The appellant has challenged the trial judge`s finding that the prison authorities were in breach of duty on the following main grounds: 
(a) the trial judge erred in holding that there was a breach of duty of care to allow knives and choppers to be issued and/or used when there was only one prison officer present in the kitchen; and 
(b) the trial judge erred on the issue of causation by holding that the respondent`s injuries were caused by the issuance and/or use of knives and choppers when there was only one prison officer in the kitchen.
In addition the appellant has also raised a preliminary objection that the trial judge erred in entering judgment against the Government without first making a specific finding that one or more officers were personally liable for the breach and the consequential injuries suffered by the respondent.
 Direct liability or vicarious liability 
 
 
 
We shall first deal with the preliminary objection which rests on ss 5 and 6(1) of the Government Proceedings Act (GPA). Those two provisions read: 
 
 
5 Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Government shall be liable for any wrongful act done or any neglect or default committed by any public officer in the same manner and to the same extent as that in which a principal, being a private person, is liable for any wrongful act done, or any neglect or default committed by his agent, and for the purposes of this section and without prejudice to the generality thereof, any public officer acting or purporting in good faith to be acting in pursuance of a duty imposed by law shall be deemed to be the agent of and to be acting under the instructions of the Government. 
 
6(1) No proceedings shall lie against the Government by virtue of section 5 in respect of any act, neglect or default of any public officer, unless proceedings for damages in respect of such act, neglect or default would have lain against such officer personally.
  
 
 
What the appellant contends is that under these two provisions there must first be a specific finding of breach of duty on the part of a particular public officer or group of officers before the Government may be liable vicariously under the abovementioned sections. In this case, the trial judge made no such finding. The appellant urges this court that the judgment against the Government therefore had no proper basis. We set out below some passages from the appellant`s case where this argument is advanced: 
 
 
47 There was no specific finding of fact by the honourable judge that a particular prison officer, or group of prison officers, are personally liable in tort to the respondent for his injuries. Without such a finding, an essential element of the cause of action against the Government is missing. Consequently, the finding of liability against the Government is wrong in law and cannot stand.... 
 
50 The appellant was not asking the court to name particular officers and single them out. What the court was asked to do was to identify the alleged negligent acts or omissions and ask whether this is the result of a breach of duty owed by a government officer to the respondent so as to attract personal liability on the government officer. 
 
51 What the honourable judge did was to make a general allusion to allow[ing] knives and choppers to be in the hands of the inmates when they were unsupervised without particularising the negligent acts or omission on considering whether any officer or group of officers would have been personally liable to the respondent in tort for such acts or omissions. The closest the honourable judge came to doing was to say that the knives and choppers should not have been issued before two officers were present ... 
 
52 By not addressing his mind to this essential ingredient of the cause of action against the Government (ie the need to first establish personal liability against the officer), the honourable judge fell into error and imposed on the Government what is, in effect, direct tortious liability, something which he is not entitled to do by virtue of ss 5 and 6(1) of the GPA.
  
 
 
The validity of the appellant`s argument therefore depends on whether in fact the trial judge found that the Government was itself in breach of a duty of care owed to the respondent, or whether he found that it was the officers responsible for the respondent`s safety who had been in breach. The appellant in his case has conceded that there is no necessity for the trial judge to identify the particular officer or officers who had breached his/their duty. Identifying a group of officers will do.
On this question, the trial judge stated thus: 
 
 
32 The prison authorities from their experience must have recognised the value of supervision, and that it makes a significant contribution to discipline ... 
 
34 ... It is my conclusion that in the circumstances which I have referred to, it was a breach of their duty of care for the prison authorities to allow the knives and choppers to be in the hands of inmates when they were unsupervised ...
  
 
 
It seems to us that in referring to the `prison authorities` the trial judge was referring to all the relevant staff in Changi Prison whose duty it was to ensure that an adequate system was in place there to supervise the inmates, to maintain proper discipline among them and to secure their safety. The Government is not an individual and may only act through its officers, who are its agents. In our view, the trial judge was not seeking to impose direct tortious liability against the Government. On a true reading of the judgment as a whole, the liability imposed was vicariously dependent on the acts of those in charge of the safety of inmates.
It is important to bear in mind the purpose of the two provisions in the GPA referred to above. Section 5 renders the Government vicariously liable for the wrongful act or neglect of any public officer in the same way as a private employer would be liable for the act or neglect of an employee. Section 6(1) provides that for the Government to be liable vicariously for any act or neglect of an officer, that officer himself must also be personally liable for that act or neglect. What s 6(1) amounts to is this: if the actions of one officer or group of officers do not amount to breach of duty for which he/they would be liable personally, then there can be no question of the Government being vicariously liable. An application of this principle would be that if an officer is accorded immunity by law in relation to his acts or neglects qua Government official, such as an officer of the court executing an order or warrant of court, then there can also be no question of the Government being vicariously liable in relation to those acts or neglects. Similarly, if an officer is entrusted with the exercise of statutory power, so long as that exercise is not unreasonable within the meaning enunciated in 
Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation
 
[1948] 1 KB 223
, there is also no question of that officer being personally liable or the Government being vicariously liable. Further amplification of this may be found in s 6(2) and (3) of the GPA.
While ss 5 and 6(1) refer to `any public officer` this does not mean that the Government would not be vicariously liable for an act or neglect caused by two or more such public officers acting in unison. Indeed, in the Interpretation Act (Cap 1), it is provided that words in the singular in any Act shall include the plural. If a claimant can show that a group of public officers has done him wrong, we do not think it necessary for the claimant to identify the officers specifically or apportion the blame between them. Thus the Government may be vicariously liable for the acts/neglects of the officers of a whole section or department.
Changi Prison is headed by a Superintendent appointed under the Prisons Act (Cap 247). He has overall responsibility for maintaining discipline in the prison, and ensuring that reasonable steps are taken for the safety of all inmates. Of course, below him there are officers who assist him in the discharge of his duties. The distribution of the duties is a matter wholly within the purview of the Superintendent, of which the inmates would have no knowledge. The inmates simply take orders. Obviously, the Superintendent and his assistants must carry out their responsibilities within the constraints of available manpower. If, on a particular day, a significant number of officers should fall ill, then it behoves those in charge to adjust or trim down the schedule of activities for the day to ensure that the supervision of inmates is at all times at an adequate level. This may involve the cancellation of some activities for that day. Whatever the internal arrangements may be, the Superintendent must be ultimately responsible if something goes wrong. The buck stops with him. It may be that in some cases his assistants may also have to share the blame, if they too have been remiss in their duties. But that depends on the facts of each case.
Of course, to succeed in making the Government liable vicariously the claimant must show that the act/neglect of an officer or group of officers fell short of the required standard of care in the circumstances and he has suffered injuries/losses as a result. The claimant has the option of suing the Government and the officer(s) jointly or the Government singly, and in either instance the claimant must prove a breach of the duty of care and the injuries or losses which he has suffered on account of that breach.
 Was there a breach of the duty of care? 
 
 
 
We now turn to the substantive arguments. The first issue to be considered is, what is the level of supervision of inmates which should be adopted by the prison authorities. For the removal of doubt we would say that, in using the term `prison authorities` hereinafter, we have in mind the meaning we have ascribed to it above. In para 1140 of 37 Halsbury`s Laws of England (4th Ed), the duty of the prison authorities is set out as follows: 
 
The duty on those responsible for ... prisons is to take reasonable care for the safety of those who are within, including the prisoners. Actions will lie, for example, where a prisoner sustains injury at the hands of another prisoner in consequence of the negligent supervision of the prison authorities, with greater care and supervision, to the extent that it is reasonable and practicable, being required of a prisoner known to be potentially at greater risk than other prisoners ... (Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
This statement of the law is derived substantially from the case 
Ellis v Home Office
 
[1953] 2 All ER 149
. In 
 Ellis 
, the plaintiff was put in the hospital wing of Winchester Prison as he was suspected to be ill. At the same time H, a convicted prisoner who was thought to be mentally defective, was also in the hospital wing for observation. On the morning of 22 July 1949, owing to a shortage of staff, there was only one prison officer on duty in the hospital wing instead of two. After opening the doors of some of the cells to allow the prisoners to empty their slops, the prison officer left the wing for a period. In his absence, H went into the plaintiff`s cell and hit him violently on the head with an implement. The plaintiff claimed damages for the injuries he suffered, alleging, inter alia, negligence by the prison staff.
Devlin J (as he was then) at first instance found that 
 there was a lack of proper supervision at the material time 
, but that there was no reason to anticipate any act of violence on the part of H. He held that the plaintiff had failed to establish negligence at common law. He said: 
 
The duty that the prison authorities owe to the plaintiff is to take reasonable care for his safety, and it is only if [the prison officer] neglected to do that that his employers, the prison authorities, may be made liable. The test of that is whether [the prison officer], when he left the landing ... ought to have appreciated, as a foreseeable consequence of what he did, that an injury might be done to the plaintiff. I do not think he ought, unless he knew, or his superiors knew - for that would be sufficient for the purpose - that H, was the sort of person who was likely, if he was allowed out of confinement, to commit an act of violence, and, therefore, had to be watched, not merely in his own interest and not merely as a matter of prison discipline, but in order that others might be protected from the foreseeable consequence of what he might do if left at large. Thus, the matter appears to me to turn on whether the prison authorities knew, or ought to have known, that H, was a prisoner who was likely, if not kept under control, to commit an act of violence ... There is nothing in H`s previous record which shows that he was likely to commit an act of violence ... [O]n [the] evidence, there would be no reason to anticipate any act of violence from H and no reason to keep any special observation, or take any special precautions with regard to him for that purpose ... [I]n those circumstances, the plaintiff, in my judgment, failed to make out any breach of common law duty. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Devlin J`s decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. All three appeal judges agreed that he had applied the correct test on the question of negligence. In the course of his judgment, Singleton LJ made the following pronouncement (at p 154): 
 
The duty on those responsible for one of her Majesty`s prisons is to take reasonable care for the safety of those who are within against their wish or will, of whom the plaintiff was one. If it is proved that supervision is lacking, and that accused persons have access to instruments, and that an incident occurs of a kind such as might be anticipated, I think it might well be said that those who are responsible for the good government of the prison have failed to take reasonable care for the safety of those under their care.
 
 
 
Both the appellant and the respondent accept that the statement of Singleton LJ correctly sets out the legal position as to the duty of care of the prison authorities. On our part, we will also respectfully adopt the same. It is apparent from 
 Ellis 
 that, to determine whether there is liability on the part of the prison authorities, two interlinked factors must be considered: (i) was there an adequate level of supervision; (ii) was the attack reasonably foreseeable. It is only when both are present that the prison authorities may be held liable in negligence for the injuries suffered.
The trial judge came to the conclusion that there was an absence of supervision on the day in question and in all the circumstances it constituted a breach of the duty of care. In coming to this view, he took into account the following factors: 
(a) The kitchen work involved the participation of some 50 inmates. This was a substantial number. 
(b) The work required the use of knives and choppers, both of which were capable of being used to inflict bodily harm. 
(c) Fights between inmates were a well-known phenomenon in prisons. 
(d) The kitchen was well separated from the annex by a high wall. When the duty officer was in one side, he could not possibly see what was going on in the other side. 
(e) Inmates were allowed to move freely from the kitchen to the annex and the cutting and chopping implements could similarly be taken from one side to the other. 
(f) On 1 January 1993, a few months before the present attack, there was also a prior incident in the prison kitchen involving the use of a chopper by one inmate on another. Only one warder was on duty at the time and he was in the annex while the attack took place in the main kitchen. 
(g) After the January 1993 incident there was a tightening of procedure whereby knives and choppers were only issued just before the delivery of the wet rations when there were likely to be two officers in the kitchen area. But this was soon not strictly followed.
The thrust of the trial judge`s finding was that supervision was crucial in the prison environment particularly in situations where inmates were entrusted with the free use of dangerous implements and were able to move about freely between the annex and the main kitchen. We would repeat his conclusion: `... it was a breach of their duty of care for the prison authorities to allow the knives and choppers to be in the hands of the inmates when they were unsupervised, particularly in the light of a similar incident which had happened only a few months before.`
 Our determination: adequacy of supervision 
 
 
 
It must be stressed that the duty which the prison authorities owe to each inmate is to take reasonable care in the circumstances and not to anticipate and guard against every conceivable eventuality. They cannot be expected to guarantee the safety of each inmate and the court must guard against setting too high a standard.
At the time of the incident it was the deployment policy of the prison authorities, having regard to the available manpower, that only one prison officer could be assigned to every work-station except for the `condemned block` and the laundry, where it was felt that for security reasons two officers were needed. In the case of the kitchen, if additional staff were available, a second officer would be assigned to be on duty there as well. That was the reason why on some days one officer was on duty in the kitchen and on others, two officers.
While the prison kitchen was in two parts, because of the wall, it was really one single work-station. No other inmates had access to the kitchen area except those inmates who were assigned duties in the kitchen. Prisoners who worked in the kitchen were specially selected and they must be persons who had no known propensity for violence. There was no criticism of the authorities` selection process nor was it suggested that the authorities were wrong to have selected Foo to work in the kitchen. There was nothing to indicate to the prison authorities that Foo was not suitable.
Tremendous stress was placed by the trial judge on the January 1993 incident. It was a key consideration in his eventual decision. He felt that that incident should have sounded an alarm to those responsible for safety, that greater supervision was needed in the kitchen. But as Tan Seng Hin said, fights between inmates and incidents of that kind did occur occasionally. He could not even remember the January 1993 incident. It seems to us that the solution to such incidents does not lie in putting in more manpower (assuming that is available) to supervise inmates in the work-stations where the incidents have occurred but rather to go into the root-cause of each incident. That appears to have been the approach of the prison authorities. If there is animosity between two inmates, then it is reasonable to expect the prison authorities to keep them apart. If an inmate is prone to violence then steps must be taken to separate him or have him more closely supervised.
Counsel for the appellant has also pointed out to us that the trial judge had erred in finding that the January 1993 incident had also happened in similar circumstances, ie that the attack occurred on one side of the wall while the officer was at the other side. He said that there was no evidence to support such a finding and that is indeed so. From exhibit `P4` produced at the trial it would appear that that incident happened in the main kitchen and the officer was also in the main kitchen, but at another section. He did not witness the fight. In any case, even if the trial judge`s finding on that aspect was correct, that was hardly of any significance. The authorities would have discharged their duty of care if they had addressed the root-cause of that incident. The argument that the January 1993 incident should have sounded an alarm, if carried to its logical conclusion would mean that in respect of each inmate in the kitchen who was issued with a knife or chopper, he would have to be constantly supervised at all times - after all, a knife or chopper is a dangerous thing and can be used by one inmate to harm another in a matter of a split second. If this is the level of supervision expected of the prison authorities, then short of closing down the kitchen (and indeed all the other workshops in the prison where various kinds of instruments are used for the works there), very many more officers would be required to effectively supervise the inmates who are issued with knives/choppers.
We are conscious that the trial judge was not saying that many more officers should have been deployed in the whole kitchen area, only that there should have been one more officer present, so that there would be one officer in the main kitchen and another in the annex. However, it does not seem unreasonable to treat the whole kitchen area as one work-station although it is separated by a wall and joined by a corridor. Indeed, even within the main kitchen, there are sections for different types of cooking, Chinese, Malay, Indian and others, and each section has its own enclosure. So even though an officer may be within the main kitchen, his view of the inmates within each section would also be obstructed. Or his attention might be drawn to something else. It was standard instructions that the officer who was assigned for duty in the kitchen was to patrol both the main kitchen and the annex and Cpl Vincent Tan did so that morning. So there could be no question of `absence` of supervision as the trial judge thought. At the very most it was a question of `adequacy` of supervision. In their judgment the prison authorities felt that one officer would be adequate to supervise the entire kitchen, though where the manpower situation allowed, a second officer would be assigned to assist. It does not follow that just because the prison authorities had from time to time (before the date of subject incident) assigned two officers to oversee the kitchen areas, that they would be in breach of their duty when they assigned only one officer on the other occasions, as was the case on the day of the incident.
It is crucial to bear in mind that in determining the appropriate level of supervision expected of the prison authorities one must balance the safety needs of the inmates with the need for them to be trained and rehabilitated so that when they are eventually released from prison they can more readily settle themselves into society. These interests are to some extent in conflict. The simplest thing would have been to lock them up all the time so that their contact with other inmates is minimal, thus reducing the chances of misunderstanding between them which could potentially give rise to fights. But to so incarcerate them would be inconsistent with modern penal philosophy and the overall interests of society. We would also add that there is a third factor which should be taken into account in the equation: the fact that the financial and manpower resources of the prison authorities are finite.
While it is true that each prisoner has committed an offence or offences which is the very reason for him being in prison, it would be wholly unreasonable to expect the prison authorities to treat each of them as if he has the propensity to violence while in prison, necessitating constant supervision. In our judgment we think the prison authorities were entitled to take the view that one officer would be adequate to supervise the inmates in the whole kitchen area, bearing in mind that each of the inmates was specially screened before being placed for duty in the kitchen. It seems to us that the significance of the January incident has been overblown. If the mere fact of a knife or chopper in the hands of an inmate gives cause for concern, then one wonders whether two or even ten officers would suffice. An inmate who has cause to injure another can do so within a split second, no matter where the supervising officer may be. He would not be concerned with the punishment he would receive for the attack but with settling a score. That seems to have been the attitude of Foo.
In [para ] 33 of his judgment the trial judge said: 
 
I accept that our prisons have to work within the constraints of limited manpower resources. But it has not been shown that it was impossible for those in charge of the prison in this case to arrange things in such a way that knives and choppers were in the hands of the prisoners only when they were under supervision.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant made two points on the above statement. First, he said that the trial judge had reversed the burden of proof, requiring the appellant to prove that the prison authorities had not been negligent. Secondly, he argued that the trial judge had set a standard of care which was far too high, ie he required the appellant to show that it was `impossible` for the prison authorities to arrange things so that choppers were only issued to prisoners when they were supervised. On the first point, the burden was clearly on the respondent (the plaintiff) to show that the prison authorities had been negligent. Reading the judgment as a whole, we think it is clear that the trial judge did not reverse the burden of proof as suggested by counsel for the appellant. In our view, the above statement was simply an indication of how the trial judge had weighed the relative positions of the parties. However, in relation to the second point, we agree that the trial judge may have misdirected himself with regard to the standards required of the prison authorities. As we have already stated, the duty of care owed to each inmate is not to anticipate and guard against every conceivable eventuality, but rather to take reasonable steps in all the circumstances, having regard to the needs of the prison as a whole.
 Foreseeability 
 
 
 
In any event, even if we were to hold that the prison authorities should have assigned two officers to supervise the kitchen inmates at all times as the trial judge seemed to suggest, it does not follow that this failure automatically leads to liability. The trial judge relied upon 
 Ellis 
 to come to his conclusion that the prison authorities were in the circumstances in breach of their duty of care and were therefore liable to the respondent. But in 
 Ellis 
, even though the court held that there was absence of supervision when the sole prison officer (ordinarily two officers were on duty in the hospital wing but that day only one was assigned to that wing due to staff shortage and two officers were on leave) temporarily left the hospital wing with no one to supervise the inmates in that wing at all, it nevertheless held that there was no liability on the part of the prison authorities (and thus Home Office was not vicariously liable) because the attack was wholly unforeseeable.
Similarly, in our case here there was no reason for the prison authorities to suspect that Foo harboured any grievance against the respondent, or that Foo was going to attack the respondent. They were never informed of the exchange of words which had taken place the previous night. As we have mentioned before, each inmate serving in the kitchen had been specially selected. Foo was in prison for four months before he was chosen to work in the kitchen in January 1993. From then until the date of the incident, he had kept a clean record. So the attack by Foo on the respondent was completely unexpected and unforeseen. In these circumstances, there could be no negligence and no prison staff could be held liable for the injury caused to the respondent on account of the attack. While we greatly sympathise with the respondent for the injuries he sustained, that per se is no reason for us to impose a higher standard of care on the part of the prison authorities.
At this juncture we would refer to only two of the cases cited to us by the appellant to illustrate the sort of standard of care expected of prison authorities in some other common law jurisdictions.
First, is 
Egerton v Home Office
 
[1978] Crim LR 494
, where the plaintiff was attacked in the lavatory of the canvas shop. At the time there were 60 prisoners working with five officers supervising them. The plaintiff was a sexual offender and he alleged that he should have been put on a special watch. The court held that the prison officers in the shop should have been told of the plaintiffs` offence so that they could take steps to guard him from attack by other prisoners. But it nevertheless held that the government was not liable as the spontaneous attack in the lavatory during working hours could not reasonably have been anticipated.
Second, in 
Coumout v Canada
 
[1994] 77 FTR 253
 the plaintiff was stabbed by a fellow prisoner who had some previous score to settle with the plaintiff. The stabbing took place outside the prison clinic/dispensary, in a location where many stabbings had taken place in the past. The plaintiff alleged that there were surveillance cameras in the area which were not functioning at the time because of the negligence of prison officers. The court held that the fact of past incidents at the same location as the stabbing was not relevant, and it was not proven that the installation and operation of video cameras would have prevented it.
 Judgment 
 
 
 
In the light of our views above on the question of liability, the question on causation does not arise for consideration and we do not propose to go into that.
In the premises, the appeal is allowed and the judgment given below in favour of the respondent is set aside. As the respondent is legally aided, there shall be no order as to costs.

Criminal Motions No 6 and 7 of 1999 were two applications taken out by the applicants who were the defendants in a libel action in Suit 1323/98. The prayers in the two criminal motions were identical, save that CM 6/99 was made by Mr VK Rajah SC on behalf of the first, second, third and seventh applicants, and CM 7/99 was made by Mr Harry Elias SC on behalf of the fourth, fifth and sixth applicants. The practical object of the applications was to gain access to certain documents and information belonging to the respondents obtained in a raid at premises of the respondents pursuant to three search warrants. The applicants wanted access to the documents and information for use in the libel action. On 27 October 1999, at the conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed the two criminal motions and I now give the grounds of my judgment.
 Background 
 
 
 
There were altogether seven applicants in CM 6 and 7/99 and I shall refer to them as `the applicants`. The first, second and third applicants, Microsoft Corp (`Microsoft`), Adobe Systems Incorp (`Adobe`) and Autodesk Incorp (`Autodesk`) are companies incorporated in the United States of America and are engaged in the business of, 
 inter alia 
, publishing and distributing computer software. The fourth applicant, Business Software Alliance (`BSA`), is a software anti-piracy watchdog body of which Microsoft, Adobe and Autodesk are members. The fifth applicant, Stuart Ong, is the legal counsel of Autodesk in the Asia Pacific region and a vice-president of BSA. The sixth applicant, Lee Cross, is a vice-president and managing director of the Asia Pacific region and regional counsel of BSA. The seventh applicant, Ronald Eckstrom, is a corporate attorney of Microsoft and a vice president of BSA.
The respondents are SM Summit Holdings Ltd (`Summit Holdings`) and Summit CD Manufacture Pte Ltd (`Summit CD`). Summit Holdings is a public company and was, at the material time, listed on the SESDAQ Board. It is currently listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Singapore. Summit CD is a wholly owned subsidiary of Summit Holdings and is engaged in the business of, 
 inter alia 
, the manufacture of CDs and CD-ROMs. I shall refer to them as `the respondents`.
The matter had its origins in CR 15/97. On 8 August 1997, BSA had applied for and were granted two search warrants before a magistrate to search the premises of Summit Holdings for alleged copyright and trademark offences. On 12 August 1997, armed with the search warrants, the representatives of BSA, police officers and also lawyers from the law firm representing BSA carried out a raid on the premises. As the first two search warrants did not permit a seizure of documents, BSA applied for and were granted, later the same night, a third search warrant by GP Selvam J who was approached for this at his home.
The respondents brought CR 15/97 to quash all the search warrants. The criminal revision came up for hearing before me. On 29 September 1997, I directed that the two warrants issued by the magistrate should stand and the third warrant issued by GP Selvam J should be quashed on the ground, inter alia, that a High Court judge had no jurisdiction to sit as a magistrate or to make orders as a magistrate. All the items seized pursuant to the third warrant and the items seized outside the scope of the first two warrants were ordered by me to be returned. The grounds of judgment were delivered on 13 October 1997: 
SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor v PP and another action
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 922
 .
In the meantime, there was an important event which gave rise to the proceedings in Suit 1323/98 and to the present applications. On 13 August 1997, immediately after the raid on the premises of Summit Holdings, the Applicants held a press conference and published or caused to be published to persons present thereat a press release. The respondents complained that the press release was defamatory of them; they contended that the press release was intended to mean that the respondents were guilty of criminal conduct, namely, the systematic manufacturing of, and trading in, counterfeit CD-ROMs, on such an extensive scale that they were responsible for the pirate CD ROM trade in South east Asia.
On 5 August 1998, about a year later, the respondents instituted Suit 1323/98 for defamation against the applicants. After the commencement of the action, the respondents applied, 
 inter alia 
, for an order that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in the press release be determined under O 14 r 12, Rules of Court, as well as judgment under O 14 r 3 against the first, third to sixth applicants, with damages (including aggravated and exemplary damages) to be assessed by a judge. Prior to the hearing, the applicants filed their joint defence. In the joint defence, they denied that the press release bore the meaning which the respondents had pleaded. By way of defence, they pleaded justification and fair comment.
The application came on for hearing before an assistant registrar. At the hearing Mr Davinder Singh SC, who was then counsel for the respondents, raised a preliminary objection to certain references in the defence and in the affidavits filed in opposition to the application for summary judgment, to documents and information obtained by the defendants pursuant to the search warrants, on the following grounds: 
(a) that there was an implied undertaking on the part of the defendants not to use such documents or information obtained in criminal proceedings in unconnected civil proceedings, as the information was confidential information on which the defendants could not rely without leave of court; and 
(b) even if there was no implied undertaking, it followed, from the order made on 29 September 1997 directing that all documents and copies seized in the raid be returned to the plaintiffs, that the use of such documents and copies and information derived therefrom was impermissible.
The assistant registrar overruled the preliminary objection and held that the information obtained as a result of the raid and referred to in the joint defence and affidavits was admissible and should be allowed to stand. She went on to rule that she was entitled under O 14 r 12, Rules of Court to make a determination as to the meaning of the words before the application for the summary judgment proper. She then ruled that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of was that the plaintiffs were guilty of criminal conduct, namely, the systematic manufacture of and trading in counterfeit CD-ROMs on such an extensive scale that they were responsible for the pirate CD-ROM trade in South-east Asia. After the two rulings were made, the applicants applied for leave to amend the joint defence to justify the meaning as found by the court, in addition to the defences previously pleaded. Leave was granted and the matter was adjourned for the defendants to amend their defence and to file further affidavits in support thereof for the summary judgment application. At the conclusion of the adjourned hearing, she ruled that the applicants be given unconditional leave to defend the action.
All the parties appealed against the decision of the assistant registrar. The respondents appealed against the order giving the defendants unconditional leave to defend the action, and against the decision overruling the preliminary objection as to the use of the documents and information obtained by the applicants pursuant to the search warrants. The applicants appealed against the order determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of. The appeals came up for hearing before Amarjeet Singh JC. The judicial commissioner upheld all the orders made by the assistant registrar and dismissed all the appeals. All the parties appealed against the decision to the Court of Appeal.
Meanwhile the respondents complained that BSA had failed to return certain documents to them pursuant to the order of court of 29 September 1997. They applied by way of CM 21/98 to commit BSA for contempt. The hearing of the criminal motion was concluded on 11 May 1999, which was after the date on which the judicial commissioner had dismissed the Registrar`s Appeals in Suit 1323/98. At the conclusion of the criminal motion, I found that there was a failure on the part of BSA to comply fully with the terms of the order of court of 29 September 1997 and accordingly held that BSA was guilty of contempt and fined BSA a sum of $5,000. The grounds of judgment were delivered on 31 May 1999: 
Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor v Business Software Alliance
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 197
 .
I now go back to the appeals before the Court of Appeal against Amarjeet Singh JC`s decision. The respondents appealed in CA 39/99 against the decision overruling the preliminary objection as to the use of the documents and information. The applicants appealed against the decision determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of in the sense pleaded by the plaintiffs. In this respect two appeals were filed: CA 37/99 was filed by the first, second, third and seventh applicants, and CA 38/99 was filed by the fourth, fifth and sixth applicants.
On 21 September 1999, the Court of Appeal dismissed CA 37 and 38/99 but allowed CA 39/99. For the purposes of these applications, only CA 39 is relevant.
In CA 39/99, in summary, the Court of Appeal held that: 
(a) the order made in CR 15/97 and CM 17/97 prohibited the use of all documents and copies thereof obtained pursuant to the search warrants and information extracted from such information or copies: [para ] 22 of the judgment; 
(b) the order of court did not, however, apply to the information or items which the raiding party saw or observed in the course of the raid at the premises of Summit Holdings, nor did it apply to what such party heard and said during the raid: [para ] 22 of the judgment; 
(c) however, it was open to the defendants [ie the applicants here] to apply to the High Court to vary the order to permit them to make use of the documents in the action: [para ] 22 of the judgment; 
(d) the order aside, there was an implied undertaking in criminal proceedings analogous to that rising on discovery in civil proceedings, which precluded the use of documents seized in the criminal proceedings for a collateral purpose, namely, in civil proceedings, relying on the House of Lords decision in 
Taylor v Director of the Serious Fraud Office
 
[1998] 4 All ER 801
[1998] 3 WLR 1040
; however, the implied undertaking was not absolute and could be varied in an appropriate case: [para ] 36 of the judgment; and 
(e) the issue of the overall interest of justice in permitting the applicants to rely on the documents and information obtained by them pursuant to the search warrants was expressly left open: [para ] 40 of the judgment.
Pursuant to the observation made by the Court of Appeal that the applicants could take out an application for a variation of the order of court or for a release of the implied undertaking, the applicants took out CM 6 and 7/99, in which they applied for the following orders: 
(1) that the order made on 29 September 1997 in CR 15/97 be varied to the extent and effect that the applicants be allowed to refer and rely on the documents, and information therein, which were the subject of the said order, solely for the purposes of defending Suit 1323/98; 
(2) that the applicants be granted a release from or variation of the implied undertaking in respect of documents and information obtained pursuant to the execution of the search warrants on 12 and 13 August 1997 that were the subject of the decision in CR 15/97 solely for the purposes of defending Suit 1323/98; 
(3) that the applicants be permitted to retain, refer and rely on the documents and information referred to and / or contained in all pleadings and affidavits filed and submissions made in all the foregoing proceedings in Suit 1323/98; and 
(4) any consequential order that the court thinks fit.
 Application for variation of the order of court 
 
 
 
With respect to the first prayer, Christopher Austin`s affidavit filed in support of the criminal motions set out the categories of documents and information which the applicants wished to use: 
(a) invoices, sales orders and signed delivery orders, which evidenced the respondents` acceptance, manufacture and delivery of pirated software to customers widely known to deal extensively in such materials (`the pirate customers`); 
(b) a customer list downloaded from the respondents` computer server which corroborated a list provided by two former employees of the respondents, and further evidenced that the respondents had extensive dealings with pirate customers; 
(c) internal memoranda of the respondents` staff, minutes and notes of meetings which indicated that the management and staff of the respondents were aware of the respondents` manufacture, sale and delivery of pirated software; and 
(d) stamper production log-books showing that numerous orders for stampers containing pirated software were accepted, processed and sold to pirate customers.
 locus standi 
Ms Engelin Teh SC, counsel for the respondents, objected to the applications, on the following grounds: 
(a) the applicants have no to make the applications to the court for a variation of the order or for a release of an implied undertaking; 
(b) the applications were misconceived as the High Court had no jurisdiction to vary a final order of court; and 
(c) even if the court had the jurisdiction to do so, the balance of justice did not lie in the applicants` favour.
I briefly disposed of the argument relating to the lack of 
 locus standi 
 on the part of the applicants to make the application. It was really a non-starter. The Court of Appeal had decided that it was not open for the applicants to make use of the documents obtained pursuant to the search warrants, or the information derived therefrom, in any collateral proceedings, without obtaining the prior leave of court. As they had not obtained the leave of court, the use of the documents and information derived therefrom in the defamation proceedings was impermissible. As the applicants were parties directly affected by the restriction, they had a direct personal interest in seeking relief to vary the order of court and/or to be released from the implied undertaking. It followed they must have the
 locus standi 
 to make an application for the restriction to be lifted. An instance in which the English Court of Appeal released an implied undertaking on the application of a third party who was not a party to the original proceedings in which the implied undertaking was given was 
Ex p Coventry Newspapers Ltd
 
[1993] QB 278
.
It was contended before me that the applicants must first obtain the sanction in writing of the Public Prosecutor if they sought to vary the order of court as the Public Prosecutor had the control and direction of all criminal prosecutions under s 336(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), relying on 
Hawa bte Haji Mohamed Hussain v Miranda
 
 
[1988] SLR 720
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 397
 . I did not accept the argument. In these two applications, the respondents were not seeking to exercise the powers of the Public Prosecutor under s 336. Neither was it a case where the Public Prosecutor was seeking to intervene and take over the conduct of the proceedings, as was the case in 
 Hawa bte Haji Mohamed Hussain v Miranda. 
 The fact remained that the applicants were parties which were affected by the order of court and the implied undertaking, and had a direct personal interest in the relief that they were seeking.
As for the jurisdiction to vary the order of court of 29 September 1997, Ms Engelin Teh SC for the respondents submitted that it was a final order of court and the High Court did not have the power to exercise its revisionary powers again over another decision made by its own court in the exercise of its revisionary powers.
The revisionary powers of the High Court are prescribed in s 266(1) Criminal Procedure Code. In 
Bright Impex v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 405
 , the High Court held that it had no power to review a decision of the subordinate court which had already been upheld on appeal by the High Court. However, in this case, the applicants were not asking for a review of its earlier decision, or for a de novo hearing on matters decided in the criminal revision. This was an application to vary the decision on the basis of new circumstances that had arisen since the decision, namely, the defamation suit that was brought one year after the decision was made. In 
Ford-Hunt v Raghbir Singh
 
[1973] 2 All ER 700
, Brightman J held that the court had power to make a supplemental order if and so far as the order was sought on new facts. In my judgment, it would not be appropriate at this juncture to list the circumstances in which the High Court may exercise its inherent power to vary its own order. Suffice it to say, in certain cases, circumstances occurring since the judgment may warrant the making of a supplemental order.
One of such circumstances was expressly noted in CA 39/97, where the Court of Appeal held that it was open for the applicants to apply to the High Court to vary the order to permit them to make use of the documents in the action: 
 
Having regard to what we have decided on the first two contentions advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs, it is unnecessary for us to proceed further and deal with their third contention, namely, that in this case the overall interest of justice favours the plaintiffs and not the defendants, and for that reason the defendants should be barred from using and relying on the documents and information obtained by them in the raid pursuant to the search warrants ... Such an issue as the overall interest of justice may arise and indeed would arise, for consideration at a later date, should the defendants apply to court for permission to use certain of the documents in the action, which they are prevented from using ... : [para ] 40 of the judgment.
 
 
 
In addition, the following observation was made where the Court of Appeal noted the assistant registrar`s ruling that excluding the evidence on the ground of such illegality was a harsh remedy: 
 
Lastly, as regards the point that excluding such evidence at this stage is a harsh remedy, we would say that the defendants are not without a remedy. It is open to them to apply to the High Court to vary the order to permit them to make use of the documents in the action: [para ] 22 of the judgment.
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal, of course, left the issue of whether the exclusion of evidence in the present case amounted to such a harsh remedy, such that the order prohibiting the use of documents should be varied. As such I ruled that the High Court had the jurisdiction to determine whether the order of court of 29 September 1997 could be varied as well as whether the implied undertaking given to the court as regards the use of the prohibited documents should be released or varied.
 Application for a variation of the order of court 
 
 
 
The burden was on the applicants to establish cogent and persuasive reasons in their application for variation of the order of court. The Court of Appeal had held that a very important consideration in such an application for variation to use the documents in the action was the overall interests of justice: see [para ] 36 of the judgment in CA 39/99.
Mr Harry Elias SC for the applicants argued that the interests of justice were in their favour. It was in the interests of justice that the all the relevant information should be placed before the court to arrive at the proper determination of the action. The documents were necessary for the applicants to substantiate their pleas of justification and fair comment in their defence to the defamation action. According to him, the documents contained damning evidence of large scale piracy committed by the respondents and the applicants would be severely prejudiced in their defence if they could not refer to the documents and the information contained therein. Unlike in the other cases, the applicants were not using the documents to mount a fresh cause of action in collateral proceedings but were merely using them as a defence. He also relied on an additional public interest considerations, viz the disclosure of matters and activities carried out in breach of the law, referring to the Copyright Act (Cap 63) and the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332).
Ms Engelin Teh SC for the respondents argued that the interests of justice were in their favour. The applicants had failed in their earlier civil claims for copyright and trade mark infringement in Suit 1596/97 and justice was not served by permitting the defendants to trawl through the documents in the hope of finding a defence; the applicants should be held to the material they had, when the libel was published. She contended that the respondents should be protected from further oppressive and abusive invasions, given that the applicants have breached the confidence reposed in them, arising from an official capacity provided for a stated purpose to misuse documents in civil proceedings.
In determining the considerations of public interest, it will be necessary to bear in mind the purposes of the order of court. In CM 21/98, the High Court held that the purposes of the order of court were threefold: (1) as a remedy for the improper seizure of documents, the seizure being improper because they were either not covered under the two search warrants or were pursuant to a search warrant that was quashed for want of jurisdiction; (2) to protect the owner`s copyright in the documents; and (3) to restore the true owner`s title, possession and right of control of the documents (see [para ] 48 of the grounds of decision). In CA 39/99, Mr Davinder Singh SC, who was then acting for the respondents, argued that the order of court of 29 September 1997 served an additional purpose of protecting the privacy and confidentiality of documents and information. This argument was accepted in the Court of Appeal: see [para ] 34 of the judgment. It was not doubted that the confidentiality of the documents and the information contained therein would be undermined if the respondents were permitted to use the documents and information derived therefrom and belonging to the applicants in their defence in Suit 1323/99.
In this respect, it was instructive to examine the principles relating to the release of an implied undertaking given to the court in respect of documents (and information derived therefrom) obtained under compulsion of law for use in collateral proceedings. Like the cases dealing with the release of an implied undertaking, the documents sought to be used here were obtained under compulsion of law. In those cases, the court had to determine whether the public interest was in favour of preserving the integrity of undertakings given to the court as the price of obtaining them under compulsion, or in favour of placing all the relevant documents before the court. The starting point was Crest 
Homes v Marks
 
[1987] AC 829
. In that case, the House of Lords held that the court would not release or modify an undertaking, save in special circumstances and where the release or modification would not occasion injustice to the person giving discovery. Each case would turn on its own special facts. This principle has been adopted and followed in Singapore: see 
Reebok International v Royal Corp
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 136
 . In 
 Taylor v Director of the Serious Fraud Office 
, the House of Lords held that, when one was considering the release or modification or an undertaking to permit a collateral use of the documents, the interests to be weighed were the public interest in allowing the collateral use and the public interest in avoiding unnecessary invasion of privacy and confidentiality of the maker of the statement and anyone to whom it refers.
Similarly, in 
Holpitt v Varimu Pty Ltd & Ors
 
[1991] 103 ALR 684
, the Federal Court of Australia held that, in an application for a release of the implied undertaking given on discovery, the court`s duty was to consider whether the applicant had shown some circumstances which took the matter out of the ordinary course, according to which production of documents pursuant to an obligation to make discovery involved the implied undertaking to the court, and, if so, whether an exercise of the court`s discretion in the application would be in the interests of justice.
An exercise of the court`s discretion in favour of an application for variation of the order of court prohibiting the use of documents will only be granted in very exceptional circumstances. This was a 
 fortiori 
 in the case where a defendant raised justification and/or fair comment as a defence in a defamation action. In a defamation action, a defendant is generally confined to the particulars of justification and is not permitted to fish for documents in the hope that something will be uncovered. Instead he should be held to the materials that he had at the time the libel was published or caused to be published.
In 
 Metropolitan Saloon Omnibus Co v Hawkins 
 (1859) 4 H & N 146; 157 ER 792, a company brought an action for defamation against a shareholder who had imputed that the company was insolvent. He applied to inspect the company`s books for the purpose of proving a plea of justification. The court refused to grant him the application. Pollock CB held that that a person who defamed another should be in a condition to justify his conduct, and not come to the court to ask for assistance to get some proof to justify his allegations.

Mr Elias relied on 
 Ex p Coventry 
 and 
 Marcel v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis 
; 
Anchor Brewhouse Developments v Jaggard
 
[1992] Ch 225
 for the proposition that it would be in the interests of justice for all the relevant documents to be placed before the court in the collateral proceedings. He submitted that 
 Ex p Coventry 
 was particularly instructive as the court released an implied undertaking to enable the defendants to use the documents in defamation proceedings. The facts in that case were very exceptional. In that case, B was convicted of unlawful wounding. A complaint was made to the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) of the conduct of the two police officers who had given evidence against B, alleging that they had falsified the evidence. A newspaper then published an article which was defamatory of the two officers and they sued the owners of the newspaper for defamation. The owners of the newspaper pleaded justification. At that stage, the conviction was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Home Secretary. For the purposes of that hearing, the court ordered disclosure to B of all witness statements and documents in the possession of the PCA. The appeal succeeded and B was released. The owners of the newspaper asked the Court of Appeal to release B, who was anxious to co-operate, from his implied undertaking pursuant to which discovery of the PCA documents was given. The owners wanted to use the documents to defend themselves in the defamation proceedings brought by the two officers.
The Court of Appeal granted the application and accordingly released B from the implied undertaking. It held that the undertaking imposed in the criminal appeal was not the same as the kind of implied undertaking in civil proceedings. Further, the court held that the undertaking should yield to the countervailing public interest which required that the newspaper be able to mount a proper defence. In that case, the court noted the important public interest ascribed to the maintenance of an honourable, disciplined, law-abiding and uncorrupt police force, the grave public disquiet aroused by proven malpractice on the part of some of those who served on that Crime Squad, and the extensive publicity attaching to the documents in question. Mr Elias argued that it was repugnant to justice that the applicants could mulct the applicants in damages by suing for defamation and then seek to stifle their defence.
Whilst it would be a strong countervailing public interest in ensuring that all relevant evidence which may be required in support of the claim was before the court in the civil proceedings, I did not think that it was a sufficient reason, by itself, to tilt the balance in their favour. On these facts, I did not think that the applicants had demonstrated that the protection of the individual`s privacy and his confidentiality of the documents should be outweighed by allowing them to use the documents.
 Ex p Coventry 
 was distinguishable from the present case: firstly, the Court of Appeal in 
 Ex p Coventry 
, in reaching its conclusion, had relied on the ground that the implied undertaking given in criminal proceedings was of a lesser degree than that given in civil proceedings. The Court of Appeal in CA 39 had already held that the implied undertaking given for documents obtained under compulsion in criminal proceedings was no different from that given for civil proceedings.
Secondly, the issue was whether the undertaking could be released to enable the newspapers to defeat a claim in damages, based on the allegations of corruption which they made, and which were the same allegations that troubled the Court of Criminal Appeal sufficiently to release B. Those allegations were grave and of immense public interest, dealing with the corruption of law enforcement officers. The documents were sufficiently particularised and identified, since they were the very same documents which led to the release of B. It had been accepted in England that there may be cases in which the result of the execution of the order, even though wrongly obtained, was to reveal such iniquity on the part of the defendant that it would be contrary to the public interest to allow it to remain concealed: 
 Naf Naf SA & Anor v Dickens 
 (London) [1993] FSR 424. However, the matters raised in the respondents` allegations were not anywhere near such a case.
The applicants submitted that there was an overriding public interest in the disclosure of matters and activities conducted in breach of the law and the court would not allow confidentiality to be used as a cloak to hide unlawful activity, relying on 
Distillers Co (Biochemicals) v Times Newspapers Ltd
 
[1975] QB 613
, 
A-G v Guardian Newspapers (No 2)
 
[1988] 3 All ER 545
[1988] 3 WLR 776
 and 
Woodward v Hutchins
 
[1977] 1 WLR 760
. I did not find that the authorities supported such a wide proposition. The cases were dealing with the issue of whether a party had the right to restrain another party from breaching the confidential information owed to him if the information was alleged to reveal matters carried out in breach of the law. In this case, prior to discovery, the applicants would have to have sufficient information to justify their allegations and to provide particulars of the same in their joint defence. At the close of pleadings, they would be entitled to discovery which might well give them the very documents in the possession, custody or power of the respondents. There was no reason why the applicants should not have to go through the ordinary discovery procedure without using the prohibited information obtained before its time.
In 
 Marcel v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis 
, the police seized certain documents from the plaintiffs in the course of a criminal investigation in relation to a property development. The plaintiffs brought two civil actions against the defendant relating to the same property development. The defendant issued a subpoena duces tecum to compel the police to produce at the trial of the action certain documents seized by the police concerning the criminal investigation which he wanted to use as evidence. The police allowed a representative of the solicitors to inspect and copy some of the documents before the subpoena was served. The plaintiffs issued proceedings against the Commissioner of Police, the defendant and his solicitors. They applied to set aside the subpoena and to restrain the defendant and his solicitors from using the documents. At first instance, the judge set aside the 
 subpoena duces tecum 
. The Court of Appeal held that the judge`s order should be set aside and the police were bound to produce the documents, subject to the true owner having legitimate grounds to challenge the subpoena, eg legal professional privilege. It was significant that in 
 Marcel v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis 
, the court held that, whilst the police owed a duty of confidentiality to the owners of documents so seized, the plaintiffs could have been required by the subpoena to produce in court at the trial of the main action documents seized from them by the police if those documents or copies had still been in their possession. There was no reason to raise any objection or immunity to the production of such documents seized by the police, if there would be no similar objection against the production by the owners. Otherwise it would have the result of giving the owner of the documents a covenanted benefit as against the opponent in the civil proceedings. In the present case, the issue was not whether the documents should be produced under a subpoena duces tecum by third parties who owed a duty of confidentiality to the owners of the document. However, this case did not call for consideration as to whether confidential documents seized under compulsion were immune from production under a subpoena duces tecum though such an issue might arise at a later date should the applicants choose to take out such a 
 subpoena duces tecum 
 to compel the respondents to produce the prohibited documents.
Further, it was the applicants who had previously invoked the criminal process of the court by obtaining the search warrants. They were found to have acted in a reprehensible and high-handed manner when they executed the search warrants. They seized a large quantity of documents and this was found to be improper because the documents were either not covered by the search warrants or were seized pursuant to the search warrant that was quashed. At the same time they sought to apply for leave for the respondents to deliver up documents, including invoices issued to suspected pirated customers, and to make copies of such documents in CM 17/97. Those documents now fall into the category (a) of the documents which the applicants now sought leave to rely on and to use. That application for delivery up was found to be a fishing expedition in 
SM Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 922
 : 
 
 
115 ... They [the respondents to CR 15/97] made an application for an order that their solicitors be allowed to make copies of documents, and an application that Summit Holdings and Summit CD deliver up the following documents: 
 
(a) copies of all invoices during the period August 1995 to August 1997 issued to the following category `C` customers: Ivan Yee, Ivan Multivision, PLL Computer, Power Multivision, ASK Trading; 
 
(b) copies of the warranties and indemnities signed by the above category `C` documents; 
 
(c) a copy of each CD-ROM produced for the above category `C` customers.
  
 
 
These two applications were made pursuant to s 58 CPC.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
117 The application for the delivery up and production of the enumerated documents was made pursuant to s 58 CPC. In PP v IC Automation 
[1996] 3 SLR 249
, the court held that s 58 CPC only related to documents which were clearly specified. It was clear that a fishing expedition was prohibited under s 58. Here BSA was embarking on a classic fishing expedition; it could not enumerate the specific documents that it required, other than a general reference to invoices, warranties and indemnities during the specified period by the customers. This application was doomed to fail.
  
 
 
Having failed in the application for delivery up and production pursuant to the criminal motion, BSA then attempted to use the copies of the same documents, which they did not succeed in retaining, to support their cause of action in Suit 1596/97. This was clearly impermissible, and they were found to be in contempt of court.
As I held earlier, ordinarily, the applicants would be required to plead their defence with sufficient particularity. They were not allowed to trawl through the respondents` books to make out a defence of justification or fair comment. At the close of the pleadings, they may be entitled to further documents to support their case based on the pleadings. No reason was advanced why they should be exempted from going through the ordinary proper procedure of discovery without making use of the information that was illegitimately obtained. In these circumstances, it was impossible to agree with the applicants that the balance of the interest of justice would fall in their favour by reason of their conduct.
In any event, the applicants could still allude to the existence of the documents and their contents in the pleadings and affidavits in Suit 1323/98. In CM 21/98 [ 
Summit Holdings Ltd v Business Software Alliance
 
 
[1999] 3 SLR 197
 ], the High Court said [at [para ] 47]: 
 
Suit 1323/98 raised completely different issues from the present case; in that suit, the defendants were not seeking to rely on documents obtained in the course of the raid by reproducing the documents in their entirety in affidavits or submissions in the summary judgment application. Rather, one of the issues was whether the defendants could raise, in the defence and in the affidavits filed in defending the summary judgment application, the 
 existence
 of information and items which the raiding party 
 observed
 in the course of the raid at the premises of Summit Holdings. Thus the issue was one of admissibility of evidence in relation to the 
 existence of chattels
 ordered to be returned, including information where the chattels were documents ... .
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal had held that, under the order of court, it was impermissible for the respondents to use the documents and copies and information derived therefrom in the summary judgment application. It was impermissible to 
 rely on those documents 
 falling within the order of court. However the Court of Appeal had also held that the order of court did not prohibit the 
 existence 
 of information and items which the raiding party saw or observed in the course of execution of the search warrants, or to what such party heard and said at the raid.
 Variation of the implied undertaking 
 
 
 
The applicants advanced the same grounds for the application for a variation or release of the implied undertaking to the court as those for the variation of the order of court. The implied undertaking to use the documents only in the criminal proceedings brought against them under the Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act, was analogous to the implied undertaking given to the court for documents obtained under discovery. As I have held above, the applicants had not shown that the interests of justice were in their favour to justify a variation of the order of court. Similarly, the application for a release of the implied undertaking, independently of the variation of the order of court, must similarly fail. After all, the considerations for a variation or release of the implied undertaking were to ensure that the court`s process was not abused and that injustice of the type which might flow from an absolute bar on any other use was not perpetrated in the process. These considerations were largely the same as those for the application for the variation of the order of court.
 Scope of the implied undertaking 
 
 
 
The applicants wished to rely on information obtained through matters observed during the course of the enforcement action. Specifically, they were: 
(a) five CD-ROMs containing infringing software belonging to Microsoft that were found with white production envelopes, with etch numbers marked on the envelopes; 
(b) stampers produced by Summit CD for the pirate customers that were removed from their positions in the stamper library; 
(c) one of the respondents` management staff approached a staff of Microsoft and admitted that the respondents had done some things wrong, but sought to explain that they were under a lot of pressure; 
(d) during the enforcement action, the Assistant Manager of the second respondent was seen removing some documents from the office and leaving the premises by the back door; and 
(e) information observed during the course of the seizure as to the nature of the respondents` business operations.
47The information obtained through matters observed during the course of the enforcement action was not the subject of the implied undertaking. As such the application for variation of implied undertaking to refer to such information was unnecessary. The Court of Appeal said at [para ] 21 of the judgment: 
 
As to how the defendants propose to prove such information [existence of the information and items which the raiding party saw or observed in the course of the raid at the premises of the respondents] and whether such information and items are relevant are different questions altogether. They relate to admissibility and relevance of the evidence, if any, in relation to the information and items.
 
 
 
Although the holding was in relation to the issue of whether the order of court covered the existence of the information and items which the raiding party saw or observed in the course of the raid, this applied equally to the issue of whether an implied undertaking exists in relation to such information. Such information was not covered by the implied undertaking, nor by the order of court. Whether such information may be used was a question of relevance and admissibility of the evidence at the trial.
 Retention of documents referred currently contained in the cause papers and submissions in Suit 1323/98 
 
 
 
The applicants submitted that they should be permitted to retain the pleadings, affidavits and submissions which they had filed thus far in Suit 1323/98, even though they were filed without leave of court, on the ground that they had adopted a position that was consistent with a reasonable understanding of the applicable law in Singapore at the material time, relying on 
 Marcel v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis 
, which I have discussed above. They contended that the court had the jurisdiction to grant retrospective leave to use documents which were subject to an implied undertaking: see 
Miller v Scorey
 
[1996] 3 All ER 18
 and 
Eckert v National Australia Bank
 
[1997] SASC 6130
.
In 
 Miller v Scorey 
 the court held that it would exercise the jurisdiction to grant retrospective leave very sparingly. In both cases, retrospective leave was not granted. In 
 Marcel v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis 
, the police disclosed the documents to the defendant`s solicitors before the subpoena was served. Dillon LJ held that the police should not disclose the seized documents, without the consent of the owners, for a purpose not set out in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, unless a subpoena had been served on the police. He went on to hold that, as the law was not clarified, he would not prevent the defendant from making use of documents, not the subject of legal professional privilege, which were covered by the subpoena but were erroneously disclosed by the police to the solicitors before the subpoena was served.
 Marcel v Commissioner of Police 
 was clearly distinguishable from the present case. The police were held to be obliged to produce the documents under a subpoena; they had erroneously disclosed the documents before the subpoena was served. The exercise of discretion to allow the defendant and his solicitors to retain the documents was premised only on the fact that they would have obtained the documents in any event under the 
 subpoena duces tecum 
. In this case, the applicants had to succeed in both their applications for a variation of the order of court of 29 September 1997 and the release of the implied undertaking before they could then raise the argument that they should be allowed to retain the documents that were held to be prohibited. Since the applicants failed in both their applications, it followed that they could not be permitted to retain the prohibited materials that were currently in the cause papers and affidavits in Suit 1323/98.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the applicants had not made out their case for a variation of the order of court or a release of the implied undertaking in respect of documents (and information derived therefrom) obtained as a result of the raid. Hence I dismissed the applications in CM 6 and 7.
Finally, as for costs, in the criminal motions, the orders prayed for were a variation of the order of court made by the High Court in the criminal revision and a release of the implied undertaking in respect of documents and information pursuant to the execution of the search warrants. Section 262(1) CPC provides that: 
 
The High Court shall have full power in all proceedings under Part VII [of the CPC] to award such costs to be paid by or to the parties thereto as the Court thinks fit.
 
 
 
Given that the applications were quasi-civil in nature and arose as a result of the civil proceedings in Suit 1323/98, and that the applicants had substantially failed in their applications in the two criminal motions, I awarded costs in favour of the respondents, the successful parties, against the applicants, pursuant to s 262 CPC, to be agreed or taxed.

 Introduction 
At all material times, the first appellant, Mr Chew Kong Huat (`Mr Chew`) was the managing director, and his wife, the second appellant, Ms Aw Mui Kee (`Ms Aw`) a director of the respondent company, Ricwil (Singapore) Pte Ltd (`Ricwil`). The third appellant, Sintalow Hardware Pte Ltd (`Sintalow`) and the fourth appellant, Thermosel Engineering Pte Ltd (`Thermosel`) are companies owned and controlled by them. In the proceedings below, the trial judge found that Mr Chew and Ms Aw acted in breach of their fiduciary duties to Ricwil and granted various reliefs to Ricwil. The appellants now appeal against certain of those reliefs.
 Background facts 
 
 
 
A Malaysian company by the name of Ricwil (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (`Ricwil Malaysia`) is a manufacturer of pre-insulated pipes. `Ricwil` is a brand name of a method of pre-insulation originating from the United States. Between 1986 and 1990, Sintalow was a supplier of various types of pipes for the purposes of air-conditioning, drainage and plumbing, and was the sole agent or distributor for Ricwil Malaysia`s products in Singapore.
Towards the end of 1990, Ricwil Malaysia and Mr Chew decided to enter into a joint venture and develop their joint business in Singapore. A joint venture agreement between Ricwil Malaysia and Mr Chew to set up a joint venture company to make pre-insulated pipes was signed in July 1990. Ricwil is the joint venture vehicle set up pursuant to their joint venture agreement in 1990. Ricwil deals in the installation of insulated water pipes for air conditioning systems and the sale of related products. The issued capital of Ricwil was $60,002 divided into 60,002 shares of $1 each. Mr Chew held 20,000 of those shares but Ms Aw did not hold any shares. The remaining shares were held by four other persons. These four shareholders, Mr Chew and Ms Aw were directors of Ricwil. Mr Chew was also the managing director and Ms Aw was the director in charge of the accounts of Ricwil. The company started operations soon after its incorporation.
Apart from their directorships in Ricwil, Mr Chew and Ms Aw were also directors of their own companies, Sintalow and Thermosel. Mr Chew and Ms Aw each held 250,000 shares of $1 each in the capital of Sintalow. None of the shareholders of Ricwil other than Mr Chew had any shares in the capital of Sintalow. As for Thermosel, it was set up only in 1995 to do business in air conditioning duct fabrication and had a paid up capital of only $2 made up of two shares of $1 each which were held, one each, by Mr Chew and Ms Aw. Again, Mr Chew was the managing director of Sintalow and Thermosel and Ms Aw was in charge of the accounts of these two companies. Ricwil, Sintalow and Thermosel occupied the same premises at No 8 Fan Yoong Road, until mid-June 1996 when Ricwil moved out of the premises. According to the appellants, Ricwil obtained its supply of carrier or bare steel pipes from Sintalow for its manufacture of pre-insulated pipes during this period. The trial judge below found that Mr Chew and Ms Aw managed the three companies, Ricwil, Sintalow and Thermosel, as though they were all companies in a group, and anyone dealing with them and the staff of any one of those companies would not be concerned to know which of the companies he was dealing with. Not surprisingly, disputes soon arose between, on the one hand, Mr Chew and Ms Aw and, on the other, the other shareholders of Ricwil. These disputes, which surfaced sometime in 1994 or 1995, came to a head in 1996. At a meeting of the board of directors of Ricwil held on 15 January 1996, Mr Chew and Ms Aw gave notice of their resignations as the managing director and director of Ricwil with effect three months from that date. But, effectively as from that date, one Mr Stanley Wong Syn Loy, a director of Ricwil, who was also at that time the general manager of Sintalow, took over the management of Ricwil and resigned as the general manager of Sintalow. Thenceforth, Mr Chew ceased to be involved in the day-to-day management of Ricwil and he eventually resigned as the managing director on 15 April 1996, but he remained a director. Ms Aw resigned as a director of Ricwil on 12 June 1996. In mid-June 1996 or thereabouts, Ricwil moved out of No 8 Fan Yoong Road and was relocated elsewhere.
 Proceedings below 
 
 
 
On 26 November 1997, Ricwil instituted proceedings against the appellants in Suit 19/97. In this action, the company made several claims against Mr Chew and Ms Aw in relation to the affairs of Ricwil. First, it was claimed that they caused and procured Ricwil to use the letter of credit facilities of Sintalow and pay to Sintalow a commission of 10%. Secondly, it was claimed that Mr Chew and Ms Aw caused eight contracts for the sale of goods agreed to be supplied by Ricwil to its customer, Speed-Air Air-Conditioning Engineering Pte Ltd (`Speed-Air`), to be cancelled and transferred to Thermosel. Thirdly, it was claimed that Ricwil was invoiced twice for the same goods and services provided by Sintalow. It was said that the double invoicing was effected or authorised by Ms Aw who was responsible for the accounts of Ricwil. Fourthly, Ricwil claimed that Mr Chew deprived Ricwil of the ownership of the duct fabricating machinery, which had been agreed to be sold to Ricwil by Kailay (S) Pte Ltd (`Kailay`), by causing and procuring DBS Finance Ltd to sell it to Thermosel. Lastly, it was claimed that Mr Chew at the expense of Ricwil procured contracts for Sintalow to supply Nippon steel pipes to Kwang Wah Engineering Pte Ltd (`Kwang Wah`) and caused Ricwil to lose the benefit of those contracts. Alternatively, it was alleged that Mr Chew and Sintalow conspired to cause injury or damage to Ricwil. The trial judge found in favour of Ricwil on all the claims and made a series of orders against the appellants concerned.
 Appeal 
 
 
 
The appellants appeal against only the following orders: 
 
 
6 The first defendant [Mr Chew] do pay the plaintiffs [Ricwil] damages to be assessed for the plaintiffs being deprived of the ownership of a duct fabricating machine system, such damages being limited to the value of the machine as at the date of the breach, namely, 29 December 1995. 
 
7 At the election of the plaintiffs: 
 
(a) the first defendant do pay the plaintiffs damages to be assessed in causing the plaintiffs the loss of contracts to supply Nippon steel pipes to Kwang Wah Engineering Pte Ltd for the Suntec City, Woodlands Seagate, and UIC projects, or 
 
(b) in the alternative to sub-para (a) hereof, an account of the profits made by the third defendants [Sintalow] in respect of the contracts for the supply of Nippon steel pipes to Kwang Wah Engineering Pte Ltd for the Suntec City, Woodlands Seagate, and UIC projects. 
 
8 The third defendants do make discovery of all documents relevant to its contracts for the supply of Nippon steel pipes to Kwang Wah Engineering Pte Ltd for the Suntec City, Woodlands Seagate and UIC projects within four weeks from the date of this order and the plaintiffs to make the election within four weeks of the said discovery. 
 
9 The first and second defendants [Mr Chew and Ms Aw] do pay the plaintiffs damages to be assessed for causing the plaintiffs` contracts for the manufacture of ducts to be cancelled and transferred to the fourth defendants [Thermosel]. 
 
10 An account of the net profits before tax made by the fourth defendants in respect of the fourth defendants` use of the plaintiffs` duct fabricating machine system, raw materials, and labour for the fabrication of ducts and such profits to be paid to the plaintiffs. 
 
11 The plaintiffs do recover against the first and third defendants damages to be assessed for the tort of conspiracy which will be assessed after the date of election under para 8 hereof.
  
 
 
These orders were made to give reliefs to Ricwil in respect of the following instances of breach of fiduciary duties as found by the trial judge: (i) the loss of the duct fabricating machinery which had been agreed to be sold by Kailay to Ricwil and which was eventually purchased by Thermosel; (ii) the cancellation of the contracts for the manufacture and supply of certain ducts by Ricwil to Speed-Air and the transfer of such contracts to Thermosel; (iii) the contracts for the supply of Nippon steel pipes to Kwang Wah; and (iv) the conspiracy to cause injury or damage to Ricwil in respect of such contracts. Essentially, the appellants appeal against the trial judge`s findings in relation to these breaches of fiduciary duties.
 Duct fabricating machinery of Kailay 
 
 
 
The first dispute relates to the duct fabricating machinery (`the machinery`) of Kailay and arose in the following circumstances. Kailay was the subcontractor of Kailay Engineering Co (S) Pte Ltd, which in turn was a nominated sub-contractor responsible for air conditioning and mechanical ventilation works for the two phases of the Suntec City project. Kailay had been obtaining its supplies of pre-insulated pipes from Ricwil. Sometime in 1994, Kailay ran into financial difficulties and was unable to pay its debts owing to various parties involved in the Suntec City project including Ricwil. By July 1994, Kailay owed Ricwil a sum of $742,958.75. As the chances of recovering the moneys owed by Kailay were remote and for the purpose of obtaining some payment from Kailay, Mr Chew, on behalf of Ricwil, decided to purchase from Kailay the machinery for the sum of $325,000 which was to be paid by setting it off against part of the amount owed by Kailay to Ricwil. An agreement in writing was made between Kailay and Ricwil on 12 June 1995, whereby Kailay would sell and Ricwil would purchase the machinery for the sum of $325,000 and this sum would be paid by Ricwil setting it off against part of the debt owed by Kailay to Ricwil. Further, one of the terms of the agreement was that the machinery would be `free from all encumbrances and/or liabilities such as hire purchase, leasing and/or likewise`.
Pursuant to the agreement, the machinery was delivered and installed in August 1995 at the premises, No 8 Fan Yoong Road, where the three companies, Ricwil, Sintalow and Thermosel, were carrying on their respective businesses. However, unknown to Mr Chew, the machinery was not really owned by Kailay but was on hire purchase from DBS Finance Ltd (`DBS Finance`) and there was still an outstanding amount of about $70,000 owing to DBS Finance under the hire purchase agreement. Kailay defaulted in payment of the hire purchase instalments in November 1995 and was unable to service the instalment payments further.
At that time, Kailay also owed Sintalow a considerable sum of money. That being the position, Mr Chew made another arrangement with Kailay. On 18 November 1995, on behalf of Sintalow he struck a deal with Kailay whereby Sintalow would pay DBS Finance the sum of $16,763 in consideration of Kailay providing Sintalow with certain equipment. That payment was, of course, not sufficient to discharge the remaining sum owing to DBS Finance. On 13 December 1995, another arrangement was made between Mr Chew on behalf of Sintalow and Kailay under which Sintalow agreed to buy certain pipes and fittings from Kailay for the sum of $100,000 and the payment of this sum was to be effected by Sintalow first paying on behalf of Kailay the sum of $70,268.42 direct to DBS Finance to discharge the remaining hire purchase instalments and secondly by setting off the balance of $29,731.58 against part of the amount owed by Kailay to Sintalow. However, subsequently Mr Chew had a change of heart and decided not to cause Sintalow to pay the remaining instalments to DBS Finance. According to Mr Chew, the second arrangement made with Kailay was later terminated orally and a new arrangement was then made by him on behalf of Ricwil with Kailay sometime after 13 December 1995, and this was evidenced by three undated letters. First, there was a letter from Kailay Engineering Co (S) Pte Ltd, the actual owner of the machinery, addressed to DBS Finance stating that the machinery was being transferred to Ricwil and that $70,268.42 would be paid to DBS Finance by Ricwil. The second letter was from Kailay Engineering Co (S) Pte Ltd to Ricwil which set out an agreement whereby Ricwil would pay the outstanding sum of $70,268.42 under the hire purchase directly to DBS Finance. The third letter was from Kailay to Ricwil stating that in consideration of Ricwil taking over certain surplus materials, Ricwil would effect the final outstanding payment of $70,268.42 to DBS Finance. These letters were purportedly issued on 29 December 1995.
The trial judge did not accept Mr Chew`s evidence. He found that there was an agreement in writing made on 13 December 1995 between Sintalow and Kailay whereby Sintalow undertook to pay the instalments to DBS Finance as part payment for the purchase price of certain pipes and fittings owned by Kailay and that the three letters were a sham and had no effect. He held that by failing to procure Sintalow to carry out its part of the agreement and to pay off the outstanding hire purchase instalments Mr Chew had allowed his interest in Sintalow to influence his actions as director of Ricwil. It prevented him from acting in accordance with his fiduciary duties and resulted in Ricwil being deprived of the ownership of the machinery.
The appellants challenge this conclusion of the trial judge. First, it is submitted on their behalf that in relation to Ricwil`s loss of the ownership of the machinery, the dominant or effective cause was not Mr Chew`s breach of fiduciary duties but Ricwil`s complete indifference to the fate of the machinery during the period between 15 January 1996 and 25 June 1996, when there were opportunities for Ricwil to acquire the machinery by making payment of the balance sum due to DBS Finance. As no payment was made by Ricwil the machinery was repossessed on 25 June 1996 by DBS Finance pursuant to the terms of the hire purchase agreement made between them and Kailay. Thermosel subsequently purchased the machinery only after it had been repossessed by DBS Finance. Secondly, Sintalow was under no obligation to Ricwil either to enter into the arrangement with Kailay on 13 December 1995 or to pay off the balance of the instalments due to DBS Finance. Nor was Mr Chew personally.
We find some force in this argument. We think that the trial judge has misdirected himself on certain material facts in relation to the findings he made. It is clear to us that the transaction relating to the acquisition of the machinery from Kailay was arranged by Mr Chew on behalf of Ricwil with the intention of recovering in kind some moneys from Kailay. The purchase price of $325,000 for the machinery was to be paid by setting it off against part of the amount owed by Kailay to Ricwil. Under the agreement made with Kailay, the machinery was to be free from all encumbrances. However, unknown to Mr Chew the machinery was still under hire purchase from DBS Finance and there were outstanding payments to be made which Kailay was unable to pay. Mr Chew then proceeded to make further arrangements with Kailay, and this time he made use of Sintalow presumably because Kailay also owed Sintalow considerable sums of moneys. He made two arrangements, as we have narrated. Under the second arrangement made on or about 13 December 1995, Sintalow in return for certain pipes and fittings would, among other things, pay to DBS Finance the outstanding instalments under the hire purchase agreement. For reasons which the trial judge did not accept, this arrangement was not implemented by Sintalow; it did not pay the sum as agreed. The trial judge found (at [para ] 49 of his grounds of judgment) that Ricwil was put in a disadvantageous position while Sintalow, which bought the materials from Kailay for $100,000 of which $70,268.42 was to be paid to DBS Finance, benefitted by being relieved of this obligation. The trial judge accepted the evidence of one Mr Chai Meng Shep, the then project manager of Kailay, and found that pursuant to the agreement of 13 December 1995 Sintalow did take delivery of the materials agreed to be sold by Kailay, and that Sintalow did not perform the agreement by making the payment to DBS Finance as agreed with Kailay. The trial judge was entitled to make this finding. However, he fell into error in concluding that Sintalow by not performing the agreement made with Kailay had put Ricwil in a disadvantageous position. As between Kailay and Sintalow, the latter was clearly in breach of the agreement made on 13 December 1995, as having taken the materials from Kailay it failed or refused to pay to DBS Finance the sum of $70,268.42. However, that obligation was owed to Kailay and not to Ricwil. Sintalow was under no obligation to Ricwil to pay that amount. Ricwil itself purchased the machinery from Kailay for $325,000 and under the agreement the machinery was to be free from all encumbrances, but as it turned out it was still on hire purchase from DBS Finance and there was a remaining sum of $70,268.42 to be paid to DBS Finance. In these circumstances, if Ricwil intended to retain the machinery, it would have to pay the sum to DBS Finance. If this sum was not paid, as it was not, DBS Finance would be entitled to repossess the machinery, which eventually they did. Mr Chew vis-.-vis Ricwil was under no obligation to use his or Sintalow`s funds to effect the payment to DBS Finance.
That was not all. A meeting of the board of directors of Ricwil was convened for 15 January 1996 and the first item on the agenda was `the takeover of machinery of Kailay (S) Limited`. At the meeting, the transaction of the acquisition of the duct fabricating machinery from Kailay was discussed. Mr Chew informed the board that in view of the huge amount owed by Kailay to Ricwil and `impending liquidity crisis` of Kailay, he had acted on his own and acquired from Kailay the machinery on behalf of Ricwil at the price of $325,000, and that the purchase was a bargain. This sum was to be paid by setting it off against part of the moneys owed by Kailay to Ricwil and there was still an outstanding sum of about $70,000 which Ricwil had to pay to DBS Finance. He further informed the board that should Ricwil decline to take the machinery, Sintalow would buy it. It appeared that the agreement made between Kailay and Ricwil was tabled at the meeting. The chairman of the board, Mr Low Chok Yin, commented that the purchase of the machinery costing $325,000 warranted the board`s approval, as that was specifically provided for in the joint venture agreement. Mr Chew defended the acquisition by saying that it was `only a contra of account, and not a purchase`. To this, another director, Ms Judy Kuan, responded that despite the fact that the price of the machinery was to be paid by way of a set-off against the moneys owed by Kailay, it was, nevertheless, a purchase and approval of the board was required. The board eventually decided to defer its decision on the machinery until it had obtained legal opinion on the documents.
Further, at that meeting, Mr Chew and Ms Aw tendered their resignations as managing director and director respectively, which were to take effect three months from that date. Effectively, as from 16 January 1996, the day-to-day running of Ricwil was taken over by another director, Mr Stanley Wong, who prior to that was the general manager of Sintalow from which position he resigned.
The trial judge found that Mr Chew did not disclose fully the circumstances surrounding the undated letters which he found were a sham. He said at [para ] 58: 
 
Mr Chew did not make a full disclosure of the circumstances surrounding the undated letters. The agreements evidenced by them were shams as I have found. Ricwil did not have to pay DBS Finance. If they were not shams then they were inconsistent with each other and could not have been valid all at the same time. An explanation was called for. None was given.
 
 
 
We agree that Mr Chew did not make full disclosure at the meeting. However, with respect, we are unable to agree with the trial judge that Ricwil did not have to pay DBS Finance. The trial judge continued at [para ] 58: 
 
No arrangements were made at any time after the directors` meeting or at all for DBS Finance to be paid and if such arrangements were made they were not carried out. Mr Chew allowed his interests in Sintalow to influence his actions as a director of Ricwil. He failed to act in the interest of Ricwil and Ricwil was deprived of the ownership of the machine.
 
 
 
With respect, we are unable to agree with this conclusion of the trial judge. No arrangement was made at any time after the board meeting for DBS Finance to be paid, because the board, rightly or wrongly, had decided to defer its decision until after legal opinion on the documents was obtained. As we have recounted, after the board meeting Mr Chew was not effectively in control of the day-to-day management of Ricwil; thenceforth Mr Stanley Wong was in charge.
There were further significant events which occurred after the board meeting which appeared to have escaped the attention of the trial judge. First, on 11 April 1996, DBS Finance wrote a letter to Ricwil, marked for the attention of Mr Chew, offering to provide a hire purchase facility of $68,690.01 repayable over 24 months to enable Ricwil to pay off the outstanding amount still owing under the hire purchase agreement made with Kailay. On 23 April 1996, Mr Chew forwarded this letter to Ricwil, marked for the attention of Mr Stanley Wong. Nothing appeared to have been done in response to the offer of DBS Finance, and no action was taken by Mr Stanley Wong or anyone on behalf of Ricwil in relation to the payment of the sum outstanding in order to obtain the ownership of the machinery.
Secondly, in mid-June 1996, Ricwil moved out of the premises, No 8 Fan Yoong Road. However, the machinery was not taken along and no request then or subsequently was made by Ricwil to take the machinery. Those in charge of Ricwil appeared to be disinterested in acquiring the machinery.
Lastly, on 19 June 1996, officers from DBS Finance showed up at No 8 Fan Yoong Road and gave notice of intention to repossess the machinery. On 25 June 1996, Chew again wrote to Mr Stanley Wong enclosing a letter from DBS Finance which stated that repossession was going to take place, and Mr Chew asked why the situation had been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent. Ricwil did not respond to the letters and did nothing whatsoever with respect to the acquisition of the machinery or the payment of the outstanding sum due to DBS Finance.
The machinery was subsequently repossessed by DBS Finance and was put up for sale in a public auction in July 1996. As the bids were low, DBS Finance did not accept any of them. DBS Finance subsequently sold the machinery to Thermosel on 8 July 1996 at the price of $60,000.
In all the circumstances, we do not see how Mr Chew could be held responsible for Ricwil`s loss of the ownership of the machinery. The failure to acquire the machinery was clearly not due to anything done or omitted to be done by Mr Chew. On the contrary, Mr Chew was interested in acquiring the machinery for Ricwil, but the decision taken by Ricwil`s board of directors on 15 January 1996 was that the acquisition should be deferred pending legal opinion on the documents. It is unclear whether or not any legal opinion was indeed sought on the documents but the fact remained that no action was taken with reference to the acquisition of the machinery or payment of the outstanding sum to DBS Finance. After the board meeting on 15 January 1996, Mr Chew was no longer effectively in control of Ricwil`s affairs. Even if he were still in control, he could not proceed further to pay the outstanding sum to DBS Finance or do anything towards acquiring the machinery, as the board had taken a clear stand that such acquisition required its approval, and the board had not given any approval; instead the board had decided to defer its decision on the machinery after legal advice was sought. The board or those in charge of the affairs of Ricwil, at the time, also took no action in relation to the offer of a new scheme of payments made by DBS Finance that was made on 23 April 1996. Ricwil also appeared not to assert any ownership over the machinery when it left the premises, No 8 Fan Yoong Road, in June 1996 and did not even respond to the notice of repossession sent by DBS Finance on 25 June 1996. In our view, Ricwil`s failure to acquire the machinery was not caused by and was not attributable in any way to any breach of duty on the part of Mr Chew as a director of Ricwil, but was due essentially to the indifference to or disinterestedness in the machinery on the part of the board or those in charge of the affairs of Ricwil at the material time. At any rate, it seems to us that the board did not, at any time, recognise or accept that Ricwil owned the machinery in the first place.
In our judgment, Mr Chew did not commit a breach of duty as a director of Ricwil in relation to the machinery and was not responsible for its loss as a result of the repossession thereof by DBS Finance. While it is true that Mr Chew did not, at the board meeting, make full disclosure of the entire circumstances relating to the arrangement whereby Sintalow would pay the sum of $70,268.42 to DBS Finance in return for certain materials from Kailay, this failure was not a breach of duty as regards the acquisition of the machinery. The two matters were not connected. As such, Ricwil could not be said to have been responsible for the loss of the machinery.
Ricwil`s claim for damages against Mr Chew for being deprived of the ownership of the machinery therefore fails. Accordingly, the order below awarding to Ricwil damages to be assessed for the loss of the ownership of the machinery cannot stand and must be set aside. For the same reasons, the claim against Thermosel for an account of profit for the use of the machinery also fails. In the circumstances that had transpired, Thermosel purchased the machinery from DBS Finance in an arm`s length transaction, free from any claim of Ricwil, and cannot be called upon to account to Ricwil for any profits derived from its use of the machinery. It follows that the order requiring Thermosel to give an account of the profits it made with respect to its use of the machinery must also be set aside.
 Contract with Speed-Air 
 
 
 
The next area of contention relates to the contracts for the manufacture and supply of certain ducts to Speed-Air. The orders for these ducts were placed by Speed-Air with Ricwil sometime in September 1995. In these orders Ricwil`s stationery and order forms were used. It was claimed by Ricwil that these contracts were made with and were performed by Ricwil, and that subsequently Mr Chew and Ms Aw caused these contracts to be cancelled and transferred to Thermosel. As a result, these contracts had been diverted from Ricwil to Thermosel and Ricwil had thereby lost the benefit of these contracts.
The trial judge found that the orders for the manufacture of ducts were placed by Speed-Air with Ricwil, not Thermosel. The contract was performed by Ricwil using its materials and goods. After this had been done, Mr Chew and Ms Aw caused the contracts to be cancelled and transferred to Thermosel by issuing Thermosel`s delivery orders in place of Ricwil`s, thus enabling Thermosel to receive the profits of the contracts without providing the resources. The trial judge held at [para ] 26-28: 
 
 
26 ... In August and September 1995 Thermosel had no employees of its own although it took on Mr Ding from Ricwil in September 1995. It had no inventory. It had no money. The business with Speed-Air was business of the kind that Ricwil could undertake. 
 
27 Ricwil`s forms of delivery order were used in each case but not because Thermosel had no stationery of its own. It had its own stationery for the purpose of the quotations. I see no reason why it did not have delivery order forms. I see no reason why Ricwil`s forms were not overstamped with Thermosel`s name if they were to have been for Thermosel`s use. I think Ricwil`s forms were used because the fabrication work was done by Ricwil. The materials used came from Ricwil. The goods were drawn from Ricwil`s inventory. The business with Speed-Air was undertaken by Ricwil. 
 
28 I find that all the contracts particularised in para (19) of the particulars under para 10 of the statement of claim were contracts made by Ricwil with its customer Speed-Air. I find that after these contracts had been performed by delivery of the goods sold Mr Chew and Ms Aw caused them to be cancelled and transferred to Thermosel by issuing Thermosel`s delivery orders in place of Ricwil`s. I find that Mr Chew and Ms Aw have failed to act in the interest of Ricwil.
  
 
 
Counsel for the appellants argues that as the board of directors of Ricwil had never ratified the purchase of the machinery, Ricwil had not acquired the machinery and could not claim to be in the business of duct fabrication. Ricwil could therefore not have entered into the contracts with Speed-Air to supply the ducts. These contracts thus belonged to Thermosel even though the stationery used in relation to the placing of these orders was Ricwil`s. Furthermore, Thermosel had already been ordered to pay Ricwil $55,149.08 as expenses incurred by Ricwil on behalf of Thermosel in the course of and for the duct fabrication business. There was no appeal against this order. The appellants say that if Thermosel was ordered to reimburse Ricwil this sum of money, Ricwil could not at the same time claim the rights and benefits of the contracts with Speed-Air.
In our opinion, in relation to these contracts with Speed-Air, the question of the board`s approval for the purchase of the machinery has no relevance. It arose much later, namely, on 15 January 1996 at a board meeting of Ricwil when it was pointed out to Mr Chew that board`s approval was required for the acquisition of assets for Ricwil. It is true that neither at that meeting nor subsequently did the board approve or ratify the acquisition of the machinery. But, in relation to the contracts made with Speed-Air, such approval or the absence of it has no relevance. The contracts should be considered in the context of the prevailing circumstances in which they were made.
On 12 June 1995, Mr Chew on behalf of Ricwil entered into an agreement in writing with Kailey to purchase the latter`s machinery, and under the agreement the purchase price therefor was paid by setting it off against an equivalent amount of the debt owed by Kailey to Ricwil. As between Kailey and Ricwil, the machinery had been paid for, and it belonged to Ricwil as from that date. Pursuant to the agreement, the machinery was delivered to and installed at the premises at which Ricwil carried on business, No 8 Fan Yoong Road, in August 1995. Now, the orders for the manufacture and supply of the ducts were placed by Speed-Air with Ricwil sometime in September 1995 and the contracts were made between them and Ricwil at or about that time. Clearly, at that time Ricwil had possession of the machinery and were in a position to perform the contracts, and the contracts were performed by Ricwil. As the trial judge found, the ducts were manufactured and supplied to Speed-Air using Ricwil`s materials and there was no reason why those contracts should subsequently be cancelled and transferred to Thermosel. The decision of the trial judge on this issue is correct and we affirm it.
Related to the same issue is a subsidiary argument pertaining to the sum of $55,149.08 which, under [para ] 4 and 5 of the judgment, was to be paid to Ricwil by Ms Aw and Thermosel as expenses incurred by Ricwil on behalf of Thermosel. Counsel for the appellants argues that this sum represented expenses incurred in the course of and for the duct fabrication business, and if this sum was to be paid to Ricwil, it would result in a double recovery, as there was already an order for damages to be paid to Ricwil for the loss of the benefits of the contracts made with Speed-Air for the manufacture and supply of ducts. The argument raised here relates to assessment of damages. There may or may not be a double recovery. It all depends on the purposes for which these expenses were incurred. If they were incurred in the course of or for the performance of the contracts, then they should be taken into account in the assessment of damages. These items of expenses should be best left to be dealt with in the assessment of damages. The order below on this item should not be disturbed.
 Contract with Kwang Wah 
 
 
 
The third area of dispute between the parties concerns their dealings with Kwang Wah. On 6 October 1995, Ricwil submitted to Kwang Wah a quotation for the pre-insulation of carrier pipes for the Suntec City project. This quotation did not include the carrier pipes which were to be supplied by Kwang Wah itself. Kwang Wah requested for a discount of 30% on the quotation. Ricwil replied in a letter dated 20 October 1995 written by Mr Chew stating that Ricwil would give Kwang Wah a discount of 22.5% on the quotation on condition that Ricwil would supply Nippon steel pipes to Kwang Wah. The letter also stated that this condition would apply to the UIC Woodlands and Seagate projects of Kwang Wah for which Ricwil was also supposed to perform the pre-insulation works on behalf of Kwang Wah. This arrangement was confirmed by Kwang Wah on 30 October 1995 and reconfirmed by Ricwil on 2 November 1995. However, as it subsequently transpired, the supplier of the Nippon steel pipes for the Suntec City, UIC Woodlands and Seagate projects was Sintalow, not Ricwil, but the agreed discount for the pre-insulation works was given by Ricwil. Ricwil therefore claimed that Mr Chew had diverted the contracts for the supply of the Nippon steel pipes from Ricwil to Sintalow, thus causing Ricwil to lose the benefit of the contracts, while bearing the burden of giving the 22.5% discount to Kwang Wah for the pre-insulation works.
The trial judge agreed with Ricwil. He held that it was the duty of Mr Chew to see to it that the Nippon steel pipes were supplied by Ricwil. As it happened, it was Ricwil that bore the burden of providing the discount and Sintalow that reaped the benefit arising from the supply of the Nippon steel pipes. He found that in this respect, Mr Chew acted in breach of his duty to act in the best interests of Ricwil and in breach of s 157(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50). He said at [para ] 65 of his grounds of judgment: 
 
The further discount was in a real sense the price paid by Ricwil for securing the supply of `Nippon` steel pipes to Kwang Wah Engineering. In my judgment Mr Chew was not only in breach of his duty to act in the interest of Ricwil but he was also in breach of s 157(1) of the Companies Act to act honestly in the discharge of his duties as a director of Ricwil. He had appropriated to Sintalow, a company all of whose issued shares were held beneficially by him and his wife, a business opportunity paid for by a discount given by him as a director of Ricwil. The discount was given by Ricwil. The pipes were supplied by Sintalow.
 
 
 
The appellants contend that the true arrangement at the time of the negotiation was that in return for the 22.5% discount given by Ricwil for the pre-insulation works, Sintalow, not Ricwil, would supply Kwang Wah the Nippon steel pipes. It was never the intention of all the parties concerned that Ricwil would supply these pipes to Kwang Wah. In other words, Ricwil would perform the pre-insulation of the pipes for Kwang Wah and Sintalow would supply Kwang Wah the Nippon steel pipes. We have difficulty in accepting such an argument. It does not make any commercial sense to Ricwil. We can see no reason why Ricwil should not also be the party to supply the Nippon steel pipes. As procured by Mr Chew, Ricwil carried out the contract for the pre-insulation of the pipes incurring a loss, while the benefit for the supply of the pipes went to Sintalow. If the intended arrangement was as the appellants alleged, then Mr Chew still did not act in the best interests of Ricwil as he was bound to do in his capacity of director. It could not be in the best interests of Ricwil to sustain a loss in order to enable Sintalow, which is his own company, to make a profit. The discount given by Ricwil and procured by Mr Chew in effect gave Sintalow an opportunity to secure the lucrative contracts of supplying the Nippon pipes to Kwang Wah.
Turning to the letter of 20 October 1995, we find it clear that Ricwil would only give the 22.5% discount on its original quotation to Kwang Wah on condition that Kwang Wah would purchase the Nippon steel pipes from Ricwil in relation to the Suntec City project. This condition was also expressly stated to apply to the UIC Woodlands and Seagate projects. The contract made with Kwang Wah was that Ricwil would carry out the pre-insulation works for Kwang Wah at an agreed discount, and in part consideration of that discount would supply to them the Nippon steel pipes. This was also to be the case for the UIC Woodlands and Seagate projects of Kwang Wah. Therefore, by procuring Sintalow to supply to Kwang Wah the very pipes that were to be supplied by Ricwil, Mr Chew had purloined the business opportunity that belonged to Ricwil and allowed Sintalow to reap the benefit of this opportunity. He had so arranged the contracts that the burden was borne by Ricwil while the benefit was received by Sintalow. This was a classic example of a breach of duty of a director of a company. In our judgment, as the trial judge found, Mr Chew breached his fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of Ricwil as its director.
 Conspiracy 
 
 
 
Based on the same set of facts, the trial judge also found that Mr Chew and Sintalow were liable for the tort of conspiracy, that is, that they conspired by unlawful means with the intention of injuring or damaging Ricwil. The act by unlawful means was carried out and the intention was achieved. Mr Chew and Sintalow were thus liable in damages to Ricwil for this tort.
In 
Quah Kay Tee v Ong & Co Pte Ltd
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 390
 , the Court of Appeal held that a conspiracy by unlawful means is constituted when two or more persons combine to commit an unlawful act with the intention of injuring or damaging the plaintiff, and the act is carried out and the intention achieved. The appellants argue that the elements of the tort have not been established even if it were found that Mr Chew was liable for having caused a loss to Ricwil by offering the 22.5% discount. The discount was not a breach of duty as it represented a bona fide attempt by Mr Chew to secure business from Kwang Wah. Furthermore, even if the tort was made out, the appellants say there was no basis to warrant a further order for the assessment of damages, as the earlier order for the assessment of damages resulting from Mr Chew`s breach of fiduciary duty in diverting the contract to supply the Nippon pipes from Ricwil to Sintalow was sufficient to cover Ricwil`s loss.
We are of the opinion that the trial judge was correct in holding that Chew and Sintalow had committed the tort of conspiracy by unlawful means. The unlawful act was Mr Chew`s breach of his fiduciary duty to Ricwil, and Mr Chew and Sintalow must have intended to injure or damage Ricwil, as Ricwil would obviously lose the benefit to supply the Nippon pipes, while shouldering the burden of giving the discount to Kwang Wah. The loss or damage to Ricwil was a necessary corollary of the profit accruing to Sintalow through the conspiracy. There was a direct nexus between these events. It might not have been the predominant intention of Mr Chew and Sintalow to damage Ricwil, but this is not a necessary element for the tort of conspiracy by unlawful means. It is only necessary when a conspiracy by lawful means is alleged: 
Lonrho plc v Fayed
 
[1992] 1 AC 448
. The tort of conspiracy was committed in this case.
The damages awarded to Ricwil in respect of its losses occasioned by this tort might well result in Ricwil obtaining a double recovery. In this respect, we have to bear in mind the observations made by Lord Nicholls in 
Personal Representatives of Tang Man Sit v Capacious Investments Ltd
 
[1996] AC 514
 at 522
: 
 
Faced with cumulative remedies a plaintiff is not required to choose. He may have both remedies. He may pursue one remedy or the other remedy or both remedies, just as he wishes. It is a matter for him. He may obtain judgment for both remedies and enforce both judgments ... There are limitations to this freedom ... A third limitation is that a plaintiff cannot recover in the aggregate from one or more defendants an amount in excess of his loss ... [O]nce a plaintiff has fully recouped his loss, of necessity he cannot thereafter pursue any other remedy he might have and which he might have pursued earlier. Having recouped the whole of his loss, any further proceedings would lack a subject matter. This principle of full satisfaction prevents double recovery.
 
 
 
In the recent decision in 
Lim Teck Cheng v Wyno Marine Pte Ltd (in liquidation)
 
 
[1999] 4 SLR 673
  this court approved these principles. In addition, it held, inter alia, that where cumulative remedies were available to a plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot recover, in the aggregate, an amount in excess of his loss. The damage sustained by Ricwil as a result of the conspiracy committed by Mr Chew and Sintalow may be the same loss sustained by Ricwil arising from the diversion of the contracts to supply Kwang Wah with the Nippon steel pipes. We express no opinion on this issue and leave it to be dealt with on assessment. While we leave the order for damages to be assessed undisturbed, we would direct that in assessing damages the above principles should be borne in mind.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
We now refer specifically to the terms of the judgment settled by the trial judge and make the following orders. We set aside [para ] 6 and 10 of the judgment. We direct that there should be no double recovery in (1) assessing damages under [para ] 7(a) or accounting for the profits under [para ] 7(b) and (2) assessing damages under [para ] 11 of the judgment. As for the costs of the appeal, the appellants have not succeeded wholly in the appeal. Accordingly, we order that the appellants be awarded only half the costs of the appeal. The order of costs in the court below will remain intact. To the extent of the orders we have made we allow the appeal. We make the usual consequential order for the refund to the appellants of the deposit in court as security for costs.

: The issue that arose in this case was whether the sentence of caning can be executed on an offender who is more than 50 years of age at the time of the execution of the sentence.
 Brief facts 
 
 
 
The appellant was convicted on a charge under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) and was sentenced to five and a half years` imprisonment and five strokes of the cane on 22 May 1999. The appellant was born on 28 September 1949 and as such was 49 years old at the time of his conviction and sentence. The appellant`s appeal against conviction was heard on 28 September 1999 and was dismissed. Upon the dismissal of the appeal, counsel for the appellant informed the court that the appellant would be turning 50 years old on the same day. In the light of s 231, Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), it was submitted by the appellant`s counsel that the appellant was not liable to be caned.
 Section 231, Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) 
 
 
 
Section 231 of the CPC states: 
 
No sentence of caning shall be executed by instalments and none of the following persons shall be punishable with caning:
 
 
 
 
(a) women; 
 
(b) males sentenced to death; 
 
(c) males whom the court considers to be more than 50 years of age.

 commission 
 
Three possible interpretations of s 231(c) of the CPC were submitted by the DPP : 
(i) that the offender would be liable to caning if he were less than 50 years of age at the time he was by the trial court; 
(ii) that the offender would be liable to caning if he were less than 50 years of age at the time of of the sentence of caning; or 
(iii) that the offender would be liable to caning if he were less than 50 years of age at the time of the of the offence.
It was submitted by the DPP that the correct interpretation was the first one, that is, the relevant time to determine the age of the offender would be at the time of sentencing.
No convenient answer can be derived from the case law as I did not come across any authority that had previously dealt directly with this issue. The case of 
Chan Chuan v PP
 (Unreported) that was referred to by the DPP was not at all useful. There was no reported judgment by the Court of Appeal and neither was there any evidence that the issue was raised or decided upon.
 Marginal note of s 231, CPC 
 
 
 
The section itself, on a plain and literal reading, is not entirely clear as to whether the appropriate time is the time of sentencing or the time of execution of sentence. There is no suggestion anywhere that the time of commission of the offence is relevant at all and hence this interpretation can be safely ruled out. A reference to the marginal note accompanying the section would indicate very strongly that the appropriate time should be the time of execution of the sentence. The relevant marginal note reads as follows: 
 
Execution of sentence of caning in certain cases forbidden [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
On the question of the reference to marginal notes in the interpretation of statutes, the local position appears to be that such marginal notes are accepted as part of the Act and may be referred to for assistance in interpreting the statute. In the local Straits Settlements case of 
Re Tan Keng Tin
 
[1932] MLJ 134
 at 135
, Terrell J held that since marginal notes are `treated as part of an Ordinance and are discussed and even amended in Committee, there would appear to be no reason why they should not be referred to assist the interpretation of the section`. This position was adopted by Chan Sek Keong JC, as he then was, in 
Algemene Bank Nederland NV v Tan Chin Tiong & Anor
 
[1986] SLR 526
 at 532
-533, 
[1987] 2 MLJ 278
 at 284, where, in dealing with the construction of a statutory provision, he referred to its marginal note and remarked that it reflected the intention of the provision.
The same position has also been accepted by the Malaysian courts where a marginal note to a section is recognised as a part of the statute and may be considered in construing the section. However, the courts have also cautioned that `due account [must be] taken of the fact that [the marginal note`s] function is merely to serve as a brief guide to the contents of the section`: see 
Ganesan a/l Singaram v Setiausaha Suruhanjaya Pasukan Polis & Ors
 
 
[1998] 1 MLJ 240
 ; 
Aziz bin Muhamad Din v PP
 
 
[1996] 5 MLJ 473
  and 
Foo Loke Ying & Anor v Television Broadcasts Ltd & Ors
 
 
[1985] 2 MLJ 35
 .
A consistent approach to the use of marginal notes can also be found in 
 Bennion`s Statutory Interpretation 
 (3rd Ed, 1997) at pp 575-577. It is stated there that, although the earlier English cases had reflected a general reluctance to resort to referring to marginal notes in statutory interpretation, the more recent judicial approach has been to seek guidance, where necessary, from such marginal notes. In 
Stephens v Cuckfield RDC
 
[1960] 2 QB 373
 at 383, Upjohn LJ said: `While the marginal note to a section cannot control the language used in the section, it is at least permissible to approach a consideration of its general purpose and the mischief at which it is aimed with the note in mind`.
 Parliament`s intention behind s 231(c), CPC 
 
 
 
Section 232(1), CPC provides that a person shall not be caned unless a medical officer has certified that he is in a fit state of health to undergo such punishment. The importance of ensuring that an offender is sufficiently healthy enough, 
 at the time of caning 
, to withstand such punishment is reinforced by s 232(2) which states that: 
 
If during the execution of a sentence of caning a medical officer certifies that the offender is not in a fit state of health to undergo the remainder of the sentence the caning shall be finally stopped.
 
 
 
Bearing this in mind, it would not be wrong to infer that the exemption from caning provided for males above the age of 50 years is intended as a presumption in law that males of that age will be unfit to withstand such punishment. It is not really the age itself that is relevant but rather the offender`s fitness of health and Parliament has deemed it appropriate to create such a presumption in law in favour of men who have attained the age of 50 years. Since the time of assessment of an offender`s state of health is at the time of the execution of the sentence, this means that the proper time to determine when the offender has attained the age of 50 years, is the date on which the caning is to be carried out.
From the above discussion, I was strongly persuaded that value must be given to the marginal note and the intention behind s 231(c) of the CPC. The marginal note provides a clear indication that it is the 
 execution 
 of the sentence of caning that is prohibited in those specified circumstances and this interpretation is certainly in no way inconsistent with the general wording of the whole section. It is emphasised that the use of the marginal note in this case has been to serve as a guide and to assist the court in more precisely defining the application of the section.
The DPP has, however, raised certain other points which may suggest a different interpretation of s 231(c) of the CPC and I shall proceed to discuss them shortly. 
 
`Punishable with caning`
 
 
 
It was highlighted that s 231, CPC uses the word `punishable` in the present tense instead of the word `punished`. This seemed to somewhat support the DPP`s contention that the appropriate time for considering the age of the offender is the time of sentencing. I would agree that had the latter term been used, the position would be much more unambiguous in that, the word `punished` would strongly suggest `time of execution of sentence` since that is the time when a person is being punished. In my view, the proper reading of the word `punishable`, in the context of the section, is that a court must bear in mind the age of an offender at the time when it passes a sentence of caning. If at the time of sentencing, the offender is of or above the age of 50 years, then that would be the end of the matter and clearly, no sentence of caning can be passed in such a situation. Where the offender is below the age of 50 years, this means that he is punishable with caning and such a sentence may be imposed by the court. However, in the light of the words in the marginal note, it also means that any sentence of caning imposed must be carried out before the offender turns 50 years of age otherwise the sentence can no longer be executed once the offender has reached that age. 
 
` Whom the court considers`
 
 
 
The DPP further submitted that the words `court considers` is also indicative that it is at the time of sentencing when the court looks at the age of the offender. The DPP`s reasoning is that this is the time when the court considers whether or not to impose the sentence of caning. I do not agree that this is the effect created by the use of the words. The phraseology may seem awkward but it must be read in the context of the historical background of the provision. Section 231 of the CPC is an old provision. In the early days, birth certificates were not issued and there was no proper record of birth dates. Hence, it was necessary then to give a certain degree of discretion to the courts in determining the age of an offender, as it was not unusual in those days for the exact age of the accused to be unknown. With the implementation of a proper registration of births and the recording of birth dates, this is no longer a problem faced by the courts today. Therefore, the use of the words `court considers` cannot be relied on to support the DPP`s contention.
 Lacuna in the legal system? 
 
 
 
Another point raised by the DPP was that a lacuna or loophole in the legal system would be created if the court was to adopt the time of execution of the sentence as the apposite time. The DPP argued that such an interpretation would allow an offender who is almost 50 years of age at the time of his conviction and sentence in the trial court, to possibly escape punishment by filing a notice of appeal against conviction and/or sentence in order to delay the execution of the sentence of caning. As the execution of the sentence cannot take place until after the appeal has been heard and dismissed, the offender might have attained the age of 50 years by then and would therefore be exempted from the punishment he deserved. The DPP also contended that there would be much uncertainty at the trial court stage as the trial judge would be faced with not knowing exactly when the caning would be carried out and the difficulty of determining whether the accused would be 50 years of age by that time.
I believed that the DPP had slightly misunderstood the application of the section. As I had stated earlier, the sentencing court must consider the age of the offender as at the time of passing the sentence. However, a sentence of caning will not be rendered improper or irregular simply because after the date of sentencing, the offender attains the age of 50 years prior to the time of the execution of the sentence. In such a situation, it only means that the execution of the sentence can no longer be carried out. The trial court therefore does not need to concern itself with whether or not the offender will be turning 50 years of age after the date of sentence. Nonetheless, I would add that the relevant prison authorities in charge of the execution of the sentence should adopt appropriate measures and implement procedures to ensure that no prejudice is caused to any accused who might be entitled to plead the exemption in s 231(c) of the CPC. As for the problem of any loophole being created, in my view, that is not a significant problem as such cases are not common and are unlikely to arise often enough to undermine our legal system. In any case, it is for Parliament to resolve any lacuna that may be present and to settle any ambiguity beyond doubt.
 Conclusion 
 
 
 
In the light of the foregoing, the proper interpretation of s 231(c) of the CPC is that an offender shall not be caned if at the time of 
 execution 
 of the sentence, he has attained the age of 50 years and above. In the present case, the appellant, having reached the age of 50 years prior to the date of caning, shall be exempted from such punishment by virtue of the operation of s 231(c).
