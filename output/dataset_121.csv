2763756,McKellar v DPP [2014] NSWSC 459,"Judgment
Introduction
1The plaintiff, Tara McKellar, appeals under s 52(1) of the Crimes Appeal and Review Act 2001 (NSW) against her conviction of the offence of larceny contrary to s 117 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the sentence imposed by Eckhold LCM (the Magistrate) in the Local Court on 27 June 2013. 
2On 27 June 2013 the Magistrate heard and determined the matter on the basis that she was not present although Mr Cranney, her solicitor, was present in court throughout.
3The principal issue raised was whether the plaintiff was before the court or whether the Magistrate was entitled to deal with her matter as if she were not. A secondary issue was whether s 38 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (the Act) allegedly required, in terms, the plaintiff's physical presence before the court that was hearing and determining the larceny charge against her. There was also an issue whether, if the plaintiff was not before the court, the prosecutor was still required to tender the police brief of evidence to prove the offence.
4The grounds of appeal are:1. The magistrate erred by proceeding to hear and determine the matter and convict the plaintiff pursuant to s 196 of the Act when the plaintiff appeared by an Australian practitioner.2. The magistrate erred in determining that s 36 of the Act did not allow an accused person to appear by an Australian practitioner in the accused person's absence.3. The magistrate erred in considering he was obliged to proceed under s 196 of the Act if the prosecutor sought to proceed under that section.4. The magistrate erred in his application of s 38 of the Act.
5It is accepted by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) that, since the Magistrate was in error, the conviction ought be set aside and the matter should be remitted to the Local Court to be determined in accordance with law.
Relevant legislation
6The Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (the Act) relevantly provides:
3   Definitions(1)  In this Act, except in so far as the context or subject-matter otherwise indicates or requires: accused person includes, in relation to summary offences, a defendant and, in relation to all offences (where the subject-matter or context allows or requires), an Australian legal practitioner representing an accused person.
15   Application of Part(1)  This Part [Part 2 of the Act] applies, to the extent that it is capable of being applied, to all offences, however arising (whether under an Act or at common law), whenever committed and in whatever court dealt with.(2)  In this Part: indictment includes a court attendance notice or any other process or document by which criminal proceedings are commenced.
36   Representation and appearance(1)  A prosecutor or accused person may appear personally or by an Australian legal practitioner or other person empowered by an Act or other law to appear for the prosecutor or accused person.(2)  A prosecutor who is a police officer may appear personally or by a person permitted by subsection (1) or by a police prosecutor.
37   Conduct of case(1)  The prosecutor's case may be conducted by the prosecutor or by the prosecutor's Australian legal practitioner or any other person permitted to appear for the prosecutor (whether under this or any other Act).(2)  The accused person's case may be conducted by the accused person or by the accused person's Australian legal practitioner or any other person permitted to appear for the accused person (whether under this or any other Act).
38   Hearing procedures to be as for Supreme CourtIn any proceedings for an offence (other than in the Supreme Court for an indictable offence), the procedures and practice for the examination and cross-examination of witnesses, and the right to address the court on the case in reply or otherwise, are, as far as practicable, to be conducted in accordance with Supreme Court procedure for the trial of an indictable offence.
192   Procedures where both parties present(1)  If both the accused person and the prosecutor are present at the day, time and place set for the hearing and determination of proceedings for an offence (including a day to which the hearing has been adjourned) the court must proceed to hear and determine the matter.(2)  The court must state the substance of the offence to the accused person and ask the accused person if the accused person pleads guilty or not guilty.(3)  Instead of hearing and determining the matter, the court may, if it thinks that the matter should not proceed on the specified day, adjourn the hearing to another day for mention or hearing.
194   Procedure if offence not admitted(1)  If the accused person pleads not guilty or fails or refuses to make a plea or the court does not accept the accused person's guilty plea, the court must proceed to hear and determine the matter.(2)  The court must hear the prosecutor, any witnesses and other evidence of the prosecutor and must hear the accused person and any witnesses and other evidence of the accused person.
196   Procedure if accused person not present(1)  If the accused person is not present at the day, time and place set for the hearing and determination of the matter (including a day to which the hearing has been adjourned), the court may proceed to hear and determine the matter in the absence of the accused person in accordance with this Division.(2)  If: (a)  a penalty notice enforcement order is annulled under Division 5 of Part 3 of the Fines Act 1996 and the order (together with any annexure) is taken to be a court attendance notice in relation to the offence, and(b)  the accused person has been given notice of the hearing of the matter of the court attendance notice, and(c)  the accused person does not appear on the day and at the time and place specified by the court attendance notice,the court may proceed to hear and determine the matter in the absence of the accused person in accordance with this Division.(3)  The court may not proceed to hear and determine the matter unless it is satisfied that the accused person had reasonable notice of the first return date or the date, time and place of the hearing.(4)  If an offence is an indictable offence that may be dealt with summarily only if the accused person consents, the absence of the accused person is taken to be consent to the offence being dealt with summarily and the offence may be dealt with in accordance with this Division.
199   Material to be considered when matter determined in absence of accused person(1)  The court may determine proceedings heard in the absence of the accused person on the basis of the court attendance notice without hearing the prosecutor's witnesses or any other additional evidence of the prosecutor, if it is of the opinion that the matters set out in the court attendance notice are sufficient to establish the offence.(2)  Before determining the matter, the court must consider any written material given to the court by the prosecutor, or lodged by the accused person under section 182.
202   Determination by court(1)  The court must determine summary proceedings after hearing the accused person, prosecutor, witnesses and evidence in accordance with this Act.(2)  The court may determine the matter by convicting the accused person or making an order as to the accused person, or by dismissing the matter.(3)  In the case of a matter heard in the absence of the accused person, the court may adjourn the proceedings to enable the accused person to appear or be brought before the court for sentencing.Note. Section 25 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides for the issue of warrants of arrest for absent defendants so that they may be brought before the Court for sentencing. Section 62 of that Act also provides for the issue of warrants of commitment after sentencing.
The proceedings in the Local Court
7A Court Attendance Notice (CAN) issued on 23 November 2012 and served on the plaintiff alleged that:Between 3.30am and 4.00am on 23/3/2011 at Dubbo [the plaintiff] did steal certain property of the value of $300 to wit, a black Quicksilver beanie, 4x Steve Grigoryan CDs, 1x Johnstone Brothers CD, 1x Life is beautiful CD, 4x Drive Time Travel Orchid Fever CDs, 3x Good Morning Vietnam CDs, 1x Bronski Beat CD, and 1x Houseworks Songs CD, and approximately $10 in small Australian Currency being the property of Michael Brennan.
8The plaintiff's matter was listed for hearing on 27 June 2013 before the Local Court at Dubbo. Her solicitor, Mr Cranney, applied for an adjournment on the grounds that the plaintiff was unable to come from Sydney, where she was then living, to Dubbo because her Centrelink payments had been terminated two days before.  The Magistrate said that, if the prosecutor wished to proceed, he thought he was obliged to deal with the matter by reason of s 196 of the Act. Mr Cranney said if the Magistrate intended to take that course, he might be able to get instructions to run the matter in the absence of the accused. When the Magistrate expressed doubt as to the availability of that course, Mr Cranney reminded his Honour that the definition of an accused person under the Act included a defendant's legal representative. The prosecutor said he was ready to proceed with the matter. The Magistrate then stood the prosecution down to enable Mr Cranney to obtain instructions.  
9When the matter resumed Mr Cranney said he had been able to contact his client, and submitted he could appear by virtue of s 36 of the Act, which he contended referred to summary matters because a ""prosecutor"" did not appear at trials.  The Magistrate said that, whilst s 36 was directed to the appearance of a legal practitioner, it was obvious the defendant was meant to be present, since the Supreme Court trial procedure was applicable by reason of s 38 of the Act. The Magistrate remained of the view that s 196 of that Act contemplated the present situation, namely the non-appearance of the defendant in person, although her legal representative was present.  The matter was stood down in the list to be mentioned at noon.
10On resumption, Mr Cranney submitted that he could conduct the matter on behalf of the plaintiff by reason of s 15, s 36 and s 38 of the Act. 
11Mr Cranney referred the Magistrate to R v Abrahams (1895) 21 VLR 343 in which a trial judge had excused four co-accused from being absent from their trial on the grounds of illness.  After commencing its deliberations, the jury returned to court for further directions from the trial judge and subsequently returned a verdict of guilty.  On each occasion the co-accused were absent but their counsel and solicitors were present.  On a case stated the Full Court held that the convictions could stand.   
12Mr Cranney also referred the Magistrate to R v McHardie [1983] 2 NSWLR 733; (1983) 10 A Crim R 51 upon which he relied for the proposition that where a prisoner escapes during a trial, the trial may proceed because such an escape can be considered a waiving of his right to be present. McHardie stood trial with his co-accused Danielson.  On the 13th day (of an 18 day trial) McHardie escaped from Parramatta gaol. The trial continued in his absence. His counsel cross-examined the remaining Crown witnesses and addressed the jury on McHardie's behalf.  The jury returned verdicts of guilty. Danielson was sentenced on 30 April 1982. McHardie was sentenced on 29 July 1982 after his arrest in Queensland and his extradition to NSW.  One of McHardie's grounds of appeal was that the trial judge should have discharged the jury when McHardie failed to appear on the 14th day of the trial.  The Court of Criminal Appeal (Begg CJ, Lee & Cantor JJ) said:Notwithstanding the general principle that at an indictable offence trial before a judge and jury the accused's presence is normally a prerequisite to a fair trial, his failure to appear after the trial has started, through his escape from lawful custody, can correctly be described and found to be a waiver of his right to be present at his trial; that the trial judge has a discretion as to whether he should continue the trial, or discharge the jury; that in NSW this principle applies to a trial whether it be one for a category of the law known as a felony, or for a category known as a misdemeanour, and that in any event, the distinction formerly applied for different considerations in cases of felony, as opposed to misdemeanour, are no longer of any legal significance in the present context. We hold that no error has been shown in the exercise of the judge's discretion to continue the trial, and that on an overall view of the trial, no miscarriage of justice has been shown in the manner now being considered. 
13Mr Cranney submitted that s 36 and s 37 of the Act distinguished between an accused and a legal representative. The police prosecutor also submitted that s 36 of the Act allowed a person to appear either personally or by a legal practitioner, and that s 37 permitted the defendant's case to be conducted by a legal representative. 
14His Honour's reasons and ruling were in the following terms:This is an application before me that the hearing in relation to Tara McKellar occur with Mr Cranney appearing as her legal representative in the absence of the defendant.  The Criminal Procedure Act sets out the legislative basis upon which summary matters proceed.  This is set out in a number of sections, s15 has been referred to and that is the application [of Part 2 ] ""to all offences however arising, whenever committed and whatever court dealt with"".   Part 2 which is ss15-27.If one turns to Part 3 Criminal Proceedings Act generally, s 36 of the Act allows a prosecutor and an accused to appear personally or by an Australian legal representative or other person empowered by an Act or other law to appear as set out in that section.  Section 3 of the Act defines an accused person as follows:An accused person includes, in relation to summary offences, a defendant and, in relation to all offences [where the subject-matter or context allows or requires], an Australian legal practitioner representing an accused person....The application therefore has some basis but I believe that it is misconstrued [sic].  Section 38 sets out that hearing procedures are to be as for the Supreme Court in relation to all criminal matters and as far as practical to be conducted in accordance with Supreme Court procedures for the trial of an indictable offence.  The bench book is one of the resources I have available to me so I have reviewed trial procedures as set out in the Butterworth's Practice and it is quite clear by inference that [it] is never contemplated that an accused person would have a trial in their absence. There is some case law, there is a case referred to by Mr Cranney from 1895 which I have not had regard to which suggests such a trial may occur, I think perhaps that things have moved from that time, certainly the Criminal Procedure Act is an Act from 1986.  Section 196 of the Criminal Procedure Act sets out one of the procedures which is widely used in the Local Court which deals with a defended hearing or a first appearance or indeed another mention as is largely interpreted in the Local Court and upon the non appearance of that defendant.  That is in the following terms:If the accused person is not present at the day, time and place set for the hearing and determination of the matter (including a day to which the hearing has been adjourned), the court may proceed to hear and determine the matter in the absence of the accused person in accordance with this Division.It is of course the case the CAN mustered [sic] out as an indictment with the elements of the offence required [sic].  This is the only contemplation that I can see in the legislation of this current circumstance.  As a matter of statutory interpretation the specific overcomes the general and consequently it is a matter where I am of the view that s196 applies to these current circumstances.CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION BY MR CRANNEY IS REFUSED.
15His Honour then sought confirmation from the prosecutor that he was seeking to proceed under s 196. The prosecution confirmed that he was. The Magistrate then asked Mr Cranney if he wished to withdraw. Mr Cranney indicated he did not wish to do so. 
16The Magistrate then said that the CAN contained the elements of the offence. His Honour then purported to make a finding of guilt under s 196 of the Act, following which the police prosecutor then sought to tender the police facts and the defendant's antecedents on sentence.  Mr Cranney invited the prosecutor to tender the police brief of evidence and submitted that where a matter was being dealt with under s 196, s 199(2) of the Act applied and that, before determining a matter, the Court had to consider any written material given to it by the prosecutor or lodged by the accused under s 182.
17The Magistrate responded:Well that's under 182 which is a written plea of guilty, you see.  It doesn't deal with 196 situations.  The facts sheet is considered sufficient in such circumstances, 182 requires me to have regard to written material or a written plea under that section.
18The plaintiff's solicitor then referred the Magistrate to Barker v Jacob (Supreme Court (NSW), RS Hulme J, 27 March 2000, unrep) in support of the proposition that a person did appear if legally represented, although personally absent.  The Magistrate, after receiving a document which referred to the case, but which did not constitute a report of the case, tried to find the case on his computer but was unsuccessful. Accordingly, no report of the decision was available to the Magistrate. His Honour noted that Mr Cranney was relying on the case in respect of a matter for which the Magistrate had already given judgment.  
19The Magistrate then asked Mr Cranney whether he was submitting that if a person was legally represented s 196 could not apply. Mr Cranney said that he was not but that the Magistrate ""would certainly be allowed to rely on the police evidence and I have no qualms about that evidence"". Mr Cranney later submitted that the offence was not made out on the brief of evidence.
20The prosecutor confirmed that on sentence he relied only on the police facts and that a fine was an appropriate penalty. Mr Cranney said that he did not wish to be heard on penalty.  The Magistrate then convicted the plaintiff and fined her $300. 
The appeal
This Court's jurisdiction
21An appeal under s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal & Review) Act  is confined to a question of law alone.  The Magistrate purported to deal with the CAN under s 196 of the Act, although the plaintiff appeared by her solicitor.  Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to invoke this Court's jurisdiction under s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal & Review) Act since the question raised is one of law. There was no need in my view for the plaintiff to include a claim under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) in the nature of prerogative relief, although the Court's supervisory jurisdiction under that section could also have been invoked: Hill & Ors v King & Ors (1993) 31 NSWLR 654 at 659 (Clarke, Handley & Sheller JJA). 
The legislative history in New South Wales of the statutory right of an accused to appear by a legal representative in summary proceedings 
22In New South Wales an accused person has been entitled to appear by a solicitor in summary criminal proceedings since at least the adoption in 1850 of Lord Jervis' English Acts of 1848 by the English Duties of Justices (Summary Convictions) Act 1950, 11 & 12 Vic c 43, s 13 of which provided in part:"". . . but if both parties appear either personally or by their respective counsel or attorneys before the justice or justices who are to hear and determine such complaint or information, then the said Justice or justices shall proceed to hear and determine the same.""[Emphasis added.]
23Section 77, the equivalent provision in the Justices Act 1902 (NSW), provided (until its repeal by the Justices Legislation Repeal and Amendment Act 2001 (NSW)):If, upon the appointed day and at the time and place for hearing or to which the hearing or further hearing has been adjourned, both parties appear in person or by their respective counsel or attorneys the Justice or Justices shall proceed to hear the case.[Emphasis added.]
24When summary jurisdiction was conferred on this Court by the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967 (NSW), s 12 of that Act was in the same terms as s 77 of the Justices Act 1902.
25In 2001 the NSW Parliament passed cognate legislation dealing with NSW courts and court procedures, particularly with regard to the Local Court.  The Acts, which took effect on 7 July 2003, included the Justices Legislation Repeal and Amendment Act 2001 (referred to above), which repealed various acts including both the Justices Act 1902 and the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967, and the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices and Local Courts) Act 2001 (NSW). The effect of this suite of legislation was to include all provisions dealing with criminal cases, whether indictable or summary, into the Act. In the Second Reading Speech, the then Attorney General, Mr Debus, specifically noted that the Act would, upon coming into effect of the legislation, include the provisions that had been in the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967 to ensure that all summary offences were dealt with in the same way (New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 4 December 2001 at 19428).
The Act
26The provisions in the Act that are of particular relevance to the right of an accused to appear by his or her solicitor are s 3, s 36, s 37 and s 192. These provisions are set out above. Section 192 is the statutory successor to s 13 of English Duties of Justices Summary Convictions) Act 1950, 11 & 12 Vic c 43 and s 77 of the Justices Act 1902.
27Section 192 and its statutory predecessors have been consistently and authoritatively construed to permit an accused to appear by his or her solicitor in summary proceedings. In referring to the authorities which I have set out below, I do not suggest that there is any ambiguity in the wording of the legislation itself.
Cases in which the statutory right of an accused to appear by a legal representative has been considered 
28In Ex parte Dunn (1904) 21 WN (NSW) 152 Dunn, a bookmaker who ran his betting business from premises in King Street, Newtown, was convicted of accepting a bet on a horserace from one W Small.  Dunn did not appear at the hearing, but was represented by counsel who entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Although the plea was accepted and entered by the Court, it was subsequently argued that since the charge was not read out, the plea should not have been accepted.  Darley CJ said at 489-490:""...the defendant did not appear in person, but by counsel, as he had a right to do.  The defendant not being present in person, his counsel, who was doubtless in possession of the information and summons, was called upon to plead, and he pleaded ""Not guilty."" It is now complained that the substance of the charge was not stated in Court under s 78 of the Justices Act.  It may be that that section does contemplate cases where a defendant is represented by counsel as well as those in which he is personally present, but it appears to me that if counsel appears, it is his duty, if he has any doubt as to the nature of the charge, to ask that it may be stated, or that the information be read.  If instead of doing so he pleads when called upon it seems to me that he waives his right to have the substance of the information stated to him.  It would be a waste of time.  In my opinion, therefore, there is nothing in that point.""
29In Ex parte Hughes; re Moulden (1946) 47 SR (NSW) 91 Hughes, who was charged with being found in a common gaming house, did not appear personally to answer the charge but his solicitor indicated he appeared for Hughes and asked the magistrate to accept from him a plea of guilty.  The magistrate refused.  The Court of Appeal (Jordan CJ, Davidson & Street JJ) held there was nothing preventing the magistrate from accepting the plea and proceeding to hear the matter. Jordan CJ, with whom Street J agreed said:"". . . it is well settled that when a trial before justices is proceeding in the ordinary way, by an information laid before a justice followed by a summons, the accused is not required to appear in person; he may appear by counsel or attorney.  This is recognised by s.77 of the Justices Act, and has been decided by the cases of Bessell v Wilson (1853) 1 E&B 489 at 499 - 500; R v Thompson [1909] 2 KB 614 and R v Montgomery (1910) 102 LT 325....there was nothing to prevent the magistrate from proceeding with the trial, since the accused was represented by an attorney who was ready, and wished, to go on.""
30Davidson J said: ""When an accused has been summoned he need not appear in person but may be represented by counsel or attorney.....And under s 77 of the Act, if upon the day and at the time and place appointed for the hearing, or to which the hearing has been adjourned, both parties appear in person or by their respective counsel or attorneys, the justice or justices are required to hear the case.""
31In R v Paauwe [1971] 2 NSWLR 235 Paauwe was charged before the magistrate with indictable offences, to which he pleaded guilty and was committed to the District Court for sentence.  On sentence his counsel indicated that his client adhered to his pleas. Paauwe was then convicted and sentenced.  On appeal he argued that the conviction was bad as the charges had never been read out. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal. The Court (Manning JA, Lee & Slattery JJ) said at 238:  It is well settled that where a proceeding for a non-indictable offence is instituted by summons, the accused is not required to appear in person and counsel or solicitor may appear for him and plead guilty or not guilty: Ex parte Hughes; Re Moulden (1946) 47 S.R.(N.S.W.) 91; 63 W.N. 293; R v Thompson [1909] 2 K.B. 614 and Ex parte Dunn (1904) 4 S.R. (N.S.W.) 486; 21 W.N. 152. But where the information results in a charge being laid, it is the invariable practice, when the accused is before the magistrate, that the proceedings should commence with the accused being charged. Once charged, his counsel or attorney in his presence, may answer for him: Justices Act , s. 70(3); R v Salisbury and Amesbury Justices; Ex parte Greatbatch (1954) 2 Q.B. 142, at p.147 per Goddard L.J.
32In Barker v Jacob (Supreme Court (NSW), RS Hulme J, 27 March 2000, unrep) a defendant did not appear in person in the Local Court but his legal adviser was present. The magistrate purported to hear and determine the matter under s 75B of the Justices Act 1902 (the statutory predecessor of s 196 of the Act) over the objection of the defendant's solicitor.  Hulme J said on an appeal to this Court:""An elementary knowledge of the practice which has prevailed in court generally over a century or more would have precluded her Worship from taking the view that a person did not appear even though a legal adviser was present when the person was not . . . 
The appellant having appeared, the magistrate was then bound to follow the requirements of section 70 [i.e. prescribing how evidence is to be taken in a summary hearing] which obliged her to have evidence given in general orally.  None answered this description.  The case was accordingly one where her Worship's conviction of the appellant and sentence imposed in consequence must be quashed.""
33I was also referred to R v Hodder (1986) 33 A Crim R 295 in which the Court of Criminal Appeal (Street CJ, Lee and Foster JJ) considered the history of ss 74, 75, 75A and 76 of the Justices Act 1902 and in particular the powers of a magistrate to hear and determine a matter under s 76 of that Act (which dealt with the circumstance of an adjourned hearing where a party or parties are not present either in person or by their legal representatives).
Conclusions
34The effect of s 3 and s 36 of the Act is that Mr Cranney's appearance before the Magistrate meant that the plaintiff was before the court and s 196 of the Act did not apply. Once the Magistrate had refused the plaintiff's adjournment application, the Court was obliged by s 192(1) to proceed to hear and determine the CAN.  Further, pursuant to s 202 of the Act, the Magistrate was obliged to hear the evidence in the matter, whether this was by way of the prosecutor tendering the police brief of evidence or the prosecution witnesses giving their evidence orally.  Section 202, in terms, contemplates that the accused person will not necessarily be present in person during the hearing and contemplates the issue of a warrant to bring the person before the Court for sentencing where a custodial sentence is to be imposed or is in contemplation. In the present case it was common ground that no penalty other than a fine would be imposed.
35This error is sufficient to require the matter to be remitted to the Local Court. However, as ground 4 raises the Magistrate's construction of s 38, it is necessary to examine the provenance of s 38 to illuminate its meaning and purpose.
36The statutory predecessor of s 38 of the Act was s 8 of the repealed Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967 (Explanatory Note to the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Justices & Local Court) Bill 2001, page 6). Unlike the Justices Act 1902, which made detailed provision regarding the conduct of summary hearings (including in s 70 of the Justices Act 1902, the statutory predecessor of s 195 of the Act, how evidence was to be taken), the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967 did not contain such detail when conferring summary jurisdiction upon this Court.  Provision was later made in the Supreme Court Rules for such procedure in Division 2 of Pt 75. Section 8 of the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967 effectively replicated s 70 of the Justices Act 1902 and was, in terms, directed to the right to cross-examine witnesses and to address the court after evidence had been taken.  
37Section 38 is a procedural provision. It was considered by Hall J in Mason v Lyon [2005] NSWSC 804 in the context of a direction made by the Local Court that written submissions be served by both parties to the prosecution prior to the hearing. Hall J found that the direction was authorised by s 26 of the then Local Courts Act 1982 (NSW).  His Honour said at [26]:Insofar as the plaintiffs relied upon the conventional principles and procedures that apply to criminal proceedings to support the argument put to the Court, it is of some importance to observe:(a) The right to address a court in accordance with the provisions of s 38 of the Criminal Procedure Act is not expressed in absolute terms but is qualified by the phrase, ""as far as practicable"". In determining practicability in this context, the following two factors are relevant so far as the proceedings before the Local Court are concerned:(i) unlike most proceedings before the Supreme Court for the trial of an indictable offence, the learned magistrate is the judge of both fact and law; (ii) the elements of the offences charged are not, in terms, in dispute. The substantive issues arise from the affirmative defences raised by the plaintiffs (as detailed above). Their complex and, to a point, novel implications, make them entirely suitable for the written submission procedure as they will assist the Local Court in dealing with them, without disadvantage or detriment to the plaintiffs (as to which see below).(b) The procedure envisaged for the filing of written submissions is not one which would, in my assessment, produce any identifiable or particular disadvantage to the plaintiffs nor would it in any broader sense undermine or impair the plaintiffs' right to a fair hearing.(c)  As events have transpired with the service of a copy of the written submissions by the prosecutor on the plaintiffs' legal representatives, there is, in my opinion, no scope for disadvantage or prejudice to the plaintiffs.
38The Magistrate's view that s 38 required the plaintiff's physical attendance at the hearing was incorrect.  Section 38 is a procedural section directed to the examination of witnesses and to a party's right to make submissions to the court. It does not have the effect of applying all criminal trial procedures applicable in the Supreme Court (which generally deals with indictable offences) to the Local Court.
39For completeness I should add that, had the plaintiff's solicitor withdrawn and the matter proceeded under s 196 of the Act (in the then absence of the plaintiff), s 199(2) would not have required the prosecutor to tender the prosecution brief.  Section 199(1) would have allowed the Magistrate to hear the matter on the basis of the CAN, but if any written material had been tendered by the prosecutor or, in the case where an accused had notified the court under s 182 of an intention to plead guilty and had sent with that notification material in mitigation of that guilty plea, then the Magistrate was obliged to consider those materials before determining the matter.  However that is not the present case. 
40Furthermore, the wording of s 196 is such as to confer a discretion on the Magistrate to decide whether to deal with the matter in the absence of the accused; it does not oblige the Magistrate to proceed. In the circumstances of the present case, it was for the Magistrate, and not the prosecutor, to decide whether to proceed, particularly in circumstances where the plaintiff had intended to be present in person but, due to matters that arose shortly prior to the hearing, could not.
Orders
41I make the following orders:(1)Quash the conviction and sentence imposed upon the plaintiff by the Local Court sitting at Dubbo on 27 June 2013.
(2)Remit the matter to the Local Court at Dubbo to be heard and determined according to law.
(3)Each party bear his or her own costs.

2763757,Greenwood v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 64,"Judgment
1CHIEF JUSTICE BATHURST:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
2HOEBEN CJ at CL:  Offences and SentenceAfter a judge alone trial before Colefax SC DCJ, the applicant was convicted of two offences:
(i) Sexual intercourse without consent pursuant to s61I Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
(ii) Indecent assault pursuant to s61L Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years.
3His Honour sentenced the applicant as follows:
Sexual intercourse without consent - imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months, commencing 10 September 2012 and expiring 9 January 2016, with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months, expiring 9 March 2017.
Indecent assault - a fixed term of imprisonment to run concurrently with the sentence for the first offence.  
4The overall sentence was imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months.  Pursuant to s5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following ground:
The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
Factual background
5As at 12 February 2011 the victim was 18 years old and living with her godmother, Margaret Doherty, at Camden.  At that time, although the applicant was married, he was no longer living with his wife.  He was in a close personal relationship with Ms Doherty and was aged 36.
6On the evening of 12 February 2011 the victim, Ms Doherty and the applicant were drinking at Ms Doherty's house near Camden before travelling in Ms Doherty's car to Newtown.  The victim was an inexperienced drinker.  The applicant was in the rear passenger seat and continued to drink.
7When they arrived at the Marlborough Hotel in Newtown, more drinks were consumed before getting out of the car.  The three of them then entered the Marlborough Hotel where more alcohol was consumed.  After a while the group had dinner at a nearby restaurant where further alcohol was consumed.  The group returned to the Marlborough Hotel and more alcohol was consumed.
8While at the Marlborough Hotel on this occasion an argument broke out between Ms Doherty and the applicant.  Ms Doherty announced that she was going to the toilet and that, upon her return, the group would be leaving.  During Ms Doherty's absence, the victim and the applicant waited for her outside.  By this stage the victim had consumed a very considerable amount of alcohol.  She had no recollection of leaving the hotel or of the events which followed.
9When Ms Doherty rejoined the others, the argument revived and the applicant walked off.  The victim and Ms Doherty returned to the car where the victim was ill.  Ultimately Ms Doherty fully reclined the front passenger seat and the victim lay down and effectively passed out.  Her head was facing the rear of the vehicle and her feet were towards the front.
10At about this time, the applicant telephoned Ms Doherty's mobile phone and asked her to collect him from Redfern.  Ms Doherty drove to Redfern and picked him up.  He again sat in the rear of the motor vehicle.  The victim was still lying on the fully reclined front seat.  It was their intention to return to Camden.  However, the argument between the applicant and Ms Doherty flared up again and at Ashfield Ms Doherty stopped the car and got out.  She threw the car keys at the applicant and told him to drive home and stormed off.  At the time Ms Doherty did that, the victim was unconscious and in the same position.
11About 10 or 15 minutes later, Ms Doherty returned to the motor vehicle.  The applicant had not driven off.  Ms Doherty was able to look into the window of the car and she saw the victim.  Although the victim was still on her back, she was in a different position.  She had been turned around so that her head was now towards the front of the vehicle and her feet towards the rear.  She was still unconscious.  Her clothing had been moved: her top was down and her bra was off with her left breast exposed.  Her jeans and her underpants had been pulled down past her knees.  Ms Doherty saw the applicant's head moving up and down between the victim's legs and very close to her groin (sexual intercourse without consent, being cunnilingus).  
12Ms Doherty confronted the applicant who left the scene and an ambulance was called.  The victim was taken to hospital and DNA samples were taken, which showed that the applicant had kissed or touched her left breast (indecent assault).
13The victim had no memory of the events of the night from a point when she was still in the hotel until she awoke in the hospital.  At that time she was sore on her shoulder blade, between her thighs and on ""her private area"", which his Honour found to be her vagina.  She had not been sore in any of those areas before setting off to Newtown.
Proceedings in the District Court
14His Honour noted that while the offences did not involve force, coercion or violence (largely because the victim was unconscious) they were nevertheless serious because of that very vulnerability - a vulnerability of which the applicant was aware and of which he took full advantage.  His Honour noted that although the victim was effectively oblivious at the time of the offences, she had subsequently become aware of what had occurred.  His Honour observed that recalling it caused her some distress when giving evidence, but to his observation not excessively.
15His Honour characterised the offence as below a midrange offence of this kind, but not at the bottom of the range.  He found that the offence of assault with an act of indecency was towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness for such offences, but not at the bottom of the range.
16There was no victim impact statement from the victim, so that there was no evidence of substantial harm to her beyond what might reasonably be expected for offences of this kind.  His Honour nevertheless regarded the offence as very serious, as indicated by the maximum penalty for the sexual intercourse offence.
17His Honour was prepared to accept that the offences were opportunistic.  Although some time was involved in carrying out the offences, his Honour was not prepared to find that they took place over a prolonged period.  He accepted that the offences took place over a period not exceeding 10 to 15 minutes, being the period of time during which Ms Doherty was away from the car.
18His Honour took into account as an aggravating factor that at the time of the offences, the applicant was on conditional liberty.  He had been arrested on 25 January 2011 on charges of damaging property, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order.  On 28 September 2011 the applicant was sentenced to periods of imprisonment for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the contravening AVO offences but those sentences were suspended.  The offences appear to be related to his marriage break-up.
19His Honour then considered the applicant's subjective case.  Although the applicant did not give evidence in the proceedings, evidence was given by his father.  His father confirmed that the applicant's marriage had broken down in 2011 and that at the time of the offending, he was separated from his wife.  His father said that as a young man the applicant had excelled at boxing, rugby league, tennis and golf.  He had worked as an employee of the Water Board but that employment had been terminated as a consequence of his conviction for these offences.  The applicant had earned good money in that employment, but since his conviction the house which he had previously owned had been sold and the proceeds divided with his former wife (presumably pursuant to orders of the Family Court).
20Apart from the matters in respect of which the applicant was on bail at the time of these offences, the applicant had no relevant criminal history.  Notwithstanding those matters, his Honour took into account the applicant's previous good character and work history and concluded that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.  As a result, specific deterrence was not as significant as general deterrence.  That having been said, his Honour observed that unlawful sexual gratification by men of maturity upon young, vulnerable women was to be strongly denounced.  
21His Honour found no evidence of any remorse by the applicant.  His Honour declined to make a finding of special circumstances because the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation would not be enhanced by a longer period on parole, notwithstanding that this was his first time in custody.
The appeal
22The applicant submitted that because of his Honour's finding that the offence of sexual intercourse without consent was below midrange, a significantly lower sentence should have been imposed.  He submitted that in the circumstances of this case, the act of cunnilingus, which formed the basis of the allegation against him was very much at the lowest end of the spectrum. The applicant submitted that given the circumstances of the case, this form of sexual intercourse was less serious than other forms encompassed by s61.
23The applicant accepted that the form of sexual intercourse was not the sole determining factor.  Other factors were ""the degree of violence, the physical hurt inflicted, the form of the forced intercourse, the circumstances of humiliation and the duration of the offence"" (R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20; 194 A Crim R 1 at [56]).  The applicant submitted that each of those matters demonstrated that the offence fell towards the lower end of the spectrum in that the offence did not involve the use of force and the physical hurt was quite limited.  Insofar as humiliation was concerned, the applicant submitted that there were no such circumstances other than the fact of the offence itself.  He submitted that the duration of the offence could not be said to be an aggravating feature since it took place during a period of, at most, 10 to 15 minutes not all of which could be attributed to the offence itself.
24The applicant submitted that a relevant factor was that he had consumed a very large quantity of alcohol.  While he acknowledged that the consumption of alcohol was a matter of only ""limited assistance"", he submitted that his intoxication ""may serve to explain how his judgment was affected to some extent in this way"" (BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159 at [79] per Johnson J). 
25The applicant submitted that for that reason his conduct could be properly characterised as ""out of character"" as that concept was explained in R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [82] per Johnson J.  
26The applicant submitted that in accordance with the finding of the sentencing judge specific deterrence was not of particular significance.  He submitted that a matter which the sentencing judge should have taken into account, but apparently did not, was that he had lost his long held employment with the Water Board, a circumstance which should be taken into account as extra curial punishment.
Consideration
27The difficulty confronting the applicant in an appeal of this kind was succinctly set out by Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 where their Honours said:
""3 ...  The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal was to determine whether there was error made in sentencing the accused, error being understood, in this context, as it was explained in House v The King: 
""It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.""
...
6 Manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion. A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or is not, plainly apparent. It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive. It may be inadequate or excessive because the wrong type of sentence has been imposed (for example, custodial rather than non-custodial) or because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short. ...""
28A similar statement of principle was made by the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25] - [27].  At [27] their Honours said:
""Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.""
29As this Court has said on many occasions, the precise nature of the sexual intercourse which took place is not of primary significance.  Certainly there is no ranking of types of sexual intercourse in some hierarchy of seriousness.  The fundamental concern is a consideration of all of the relevant circumstances, including the nature of the sexual intercourse involved.  A recent statement of that proposition was made by Bellew J (with whom Slattery J and I agreed) in Adam Jolly v R [2013] NSWCCA 76 at [72] where his Honour said:
""72 To the extent that the applicant's written submissions suggested that the objective seriousness of the offending was less because the intercourse was in the nature of fellatio, such a submission should be rejected for two reasons. Firstly, the submission reflects a serious underestimation of the reality of the applicant's offending. Secondly, it reflects an approach which is contrary to principle. The nature of the sexual intercourse which occurs in offending of this nature should not be considered in isolation, and then ranked in some form of hierarchy (see R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 at [36] per McClellan CJ at CL).""
30Similar observations were made in Doe v R [2013] NSW 248 at [48] and RO v R [2013] NSWCCA 162 at [99] (both in relation to digital penetration as distinct from penile penetration).
31It is true that this offence did not involve the use of violence or the administration of some stupefying substance.  Nevertheless the condition of the victim was such that she was completely helpless.  While the absence of such aggravating features is relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence, his offending should be assessed by reference to what it did involve.
32The fact that the victim was unconscious when the offences took place, undoubtedly limited the extent of physical hurt.  Her complaints at the hospital, however, make it clear that some physical hurt was suffered, i.e. to her shoulder blade, between her thighs and to her vagina.  While the precise circumstances in which that hurt was suffered may not be known, the overwhelming inference, certainly one which can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt, is that the soreness between the victim's thighs and to her vagina was a direct result of the applicant's conduct.  As was appropriately submitted by the Crown, in those circumstances the victim is left for the rest of her life to speculate about what the applicant did to her between the 10 - 15 minutes when he was alone with her.  The applicant's conduct was a disgraceful intrusive interference with the intimate personal integrity of the victim which must have caused her continuing humiliation and distress.
33The submission by the applicant that these offences were ""out of character"" is not made out.  There is simply no evidence concerning the applicant's character except that he had previously been convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order.  All that can be said in the applicant's favour is that he had not been convicted of this type of offence before.
34The reliance placed by the applicant on his intoxication ""to explain"" his conduct is largely misconceived.  This Court has consistently stated that intoxication of itself is not a matter to be taken into account in mitigation.  His intoxication may be relevant to the lack of planning and opportunism involved in the offending, but that is all.
35There is no substance in the applicant's submission that his Honour erred in failing to take into account by way of ""extra curial punishment"" the fact that the applicant had lost his job as a result of his conviction for this offence.  Loss of employment, no matter what the employment, would be an inevitable consequence in almost every circumstance where a person was convicted of an offence of this kind.
36The difficulties with such an approach were identified by Basten JA in somewhat different circumstances when referring to the loss of a profession, in Einfeld v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 at [85] - [97] (RS Hulme and Latham JJ agreeing).
""87 ...  Nevertheless, the label ""extra-curial punishment"" seems inapposite in relation to all of these considerations ...  Nor is it desirable to address them all under the same heading. Some consideration must be given to the consequences of how particular matters are taken into account. Thus, loss of good standing in the community may readily give rise to an element of double counting, if the offender is also given favourable consideration for his or her prior good character. Taking account of the economic consequences (including loss of employment) which inevitably follow from imprisonment, may mean that those previously in employment will receive shorter sentences than those who were unemployed.""
37The sentence imposed here was not manifestly excessive.  It involved an appropriate exercise of discretion by the sentencing judge.  The sentencing judge was confronted with a serious offence perpetrated on a helpless and vulnerable victim, whose unconscious state provided an opportunity for the applicant to exploit the situation.
38The sentence imposed was in accordance with two important guidelines, i.e. the standard non-parole period of 7 years and the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years.  The offending was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was on bail at the time.  There was no evidence of contrition or remorse.  As his Honour appreciated, an offence of this kind requires a stern sentence so that the principle of general deterrence can be given effect to and this kind of exploitative conduct clearly denounced.  
39This ground of appeal has not been made out.
40The order which I propose is that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.
41ADAMS J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2763767,Jacob v R [2014] NSWCCA 65,"Judgment

1WARD JA: I have read in draft the respective judgments of Johnson J and RS Hulme AJ. For the reasons set out below, I agree with the conclusions reached by RS Hulme AJ and the orders his Honour proposes.

2The factual background to the matter has been set out in RS Hulme AJ's reasons. The legislative history concerning regulation of prohibited weapons in New South Wales has been set out in the reasons of Johnson J. There is no need to repeat those matters.

3As is apparent from their Honours' respective reasons, the crux of the matter, insofar as Grounds 1 and 2 are concerned, is the meaning of the definition of crossbow in Schedule 1 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 and the application of s.4(2)(a) of that Act on the facts of this case. The respective submissions of the parties in relation to that issue and the various alternative constructions that may be placed on the definition have been canvassed in the reasons of Johnson J and RS Hulme AJ.

4The objects of the Act, as set out in s.3(1) of the Act, are not in doubt. Nor is there any difficulty with the proposition that one may have regard to the general purpose and policy of the provision and the mischief the provision was seeking to remedy. The Crown emphasises the policy aspect of the matter in its submissions. However, s.3 is predicated on the existence of something that is a prohibited weapon. It does not provide assistance in determining whether a particular object (in this case an unassembled object which, when assembled, can function as a crossbow) falls within the definition of a prohibited weapon. 

5Turning to the wording of the definition of crossbow, the parenthetical words ""or any similar device"" do not provide any assistance in answering the question of construction in this particular case. That is because they precede the words ""consisting of a bow fitted transversely on ..."". Thus, for a device similar to a crossbow to be treated as a crossbow by reason of the parenthetical words, that similar device must also consist of a ""bow fitted transversely on a stock that has a groove or barrel designed to direct an arrow or bolt"". 

6Linguistically, the words ""that has a groove or barrel designed to direct an arrow or bolt"" must qualify ""a stock"" and the words ""designed to direct an arrow or bolt"" must qualify ""a groove or barrel"". Reading the plain words of the definition, for an item to fit within the definition, it must consist of ""a bow fitted transversely on a stock"" that must have a groove or barrel that in turn is ""designed to direct an arrow or bolt"".

7The difficulty in the present case is the requirement that there be a bow ""fitted transversely on"" the stock. The language there used focuses on whether there is a bow that is actually fitted (transversely) on a stock, not that there is a bow capable of being fitted transversely on a stock.

8The Crown relies on s.4(2)(a) to overcome this difficulty.

9As was accepted by Senior Counsel for the appellant, it is appropriate to adopt a purposive construction of s.4(2)(a) of the Act (which provides that anything that would be a prohibited weapon if it did not have something missing from it, or a defect or obstruction in it, is taken to be a prohibited weapon). However, he contends that a broad interpretation to the section should not be given because it is a penal provision. 

10The appellant contends that s.4(2)(a) does not assist the Crown because possession of a part of a crossbow is not an offence under the Act and s.4(2)(a) should not be construed as turning a single part into the whole by a process of accumulation or accretion.

11RS Hulme AJ has posited two possible limitations on the operation of s.4(2)(a): first, that the ""something missing"" must be confined, so that what remains is in substance a prohibited weapon; and, secondly, that the component under consideration must have been at one stage part of a complete prohibited weapon from which other part(s) have been detached and therefore can be regarded as missing. 

12I have some difficulty with the alternative view because there is nothing in the definition to suggest a temporal aspect to the operation of s.4(2)(a), i.e., that it was once complete or functioning and now no longer is. However, the first of the limitations identified by RS Hulme AJ seems to me, with respect, to have force. I read s.4(2)(a) as contemplating that the ""something missing"" is a component part of the whole item but not the main or principal part of the item. That seems to me to give content to the expression ""would be a prohibited weapon if it did not have something missing from it"" and leads to a commonsense result. 

13On that construction, a string, which when added to a bow fitted transversely on a stock and tensioned would constitute a completed crossbow, would not be a prohibited weapon on its own, but a bow fitted transversely on a stock missing a string would be a prohibited weapon.

14Similarly, if one considers the example of a slingshot, the Y-shaped frame is surely the principal element of the weapon. Therefore, even if a string is missing one can still readily see that the Y frame would be treated as being a slingshot by reason of s.4(2)(a). However, the string alone would not be. 

15It seems to have been accepted that the unassembled Jaguar crossbow parts included both a stock and a part that, when fitted transversely to the stock would constitute a bow for the purposes of the definition. (The position was somewhat different in relation to the three metallic items but for present purposes that does not matter.) On the reading of s.4(2)(a) that I consider follows as a textual matter, the difficulty is that it is not apparent that the stock (with groove or barrel designed for the requisite purpose) was the main element of the weapon, such that the unassembled ""bow"" is the element that satisfies the ""something missing"" part of the definition (such that the stock alone would be a prohibited weapon for the purposes of s.4(2)(a)) and vice versa. In other words, it is not clear which of the unassembled parts would be treated as the weapon and what is the missing part. On the Crown's construction, the unassembled crossbow parts in the Jaguar box would arguably have constituted two crossbows - the stock and the bow, each with a part missing. This highlights the difficulty in treating the unassembled parts as being the prohibited weapon.

16The definition of crossbow makes clear that the device must consist of a bow ""fitted"" transversely on a stock. In the absence of a bow that is ""fitted"" transversely on the stock, the unassembled parts do not in my opinion constitute a crossbow within the definition.

17I accept that there is incongruity in the notion that the sale of unassembled parts which, once assembled, would fall within the definition of crossbow and which appear to have been marketed for sale as a crossbow will not constitute a prohibited weapon for the purposes of the definition. However, that is the effect of the wording that has been adopted by the legislature. It is for the Parliament to amend the legislation if it seeks to include as prohibited weapons unassembled parts that together, when assembled, would fall within the definition. That could be done in a number of ways, say by including a further paragraph to s.4(2) or, perhaps, by moving the words ""or similar device"" to the end of the definition of crossbow so that it would not be necessary for there to be a bow fitted transversely on a stock but simply a device similar to that. However, this is a penal provision and it is not for the Court to rewrite the legislation.

18For those reasons, I agree with the conclusion RS Hulme AJ has reached in relation to Grounds 1 and 2. 

19As to Ground 3, I share their Honours' view as to the doubtfulness of the admissibility of the expert evidence given as to the items in question. The criticism made of Mr Garland's evidence, as I read it, was the impression gained by the trial judge that Mr Garland was actively seeking to advocate his client's case rather than presenting as an objective witness. That was a view that her Honour was best placed to form. In any event, I agree with Johnson J that no miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated arising from the matters complained of in Ground 3.

20As to sentence, I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by RS Hulme AJ.

21JOHNSON J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgments of Ward JA and RS Hulme AJ. I have reached a different view with respect to the appeal against conviction. This view has consequences with respect to the sentence appeal.

22The judgment of RS Hulme AJ identifies the background to the appeal.

Factual Background

23The following facts concern events giving rise to the four charges upon which the Appellant went to trial. As RS Hulme AJ has stated, there were other offences giving rise to pleas of guilty for which the Appellant was sentenced as well.

24In 2010, the Appellant was the sole operator of a business known as Lock Trading Pty Limited, operating from premises at Penrith. In July 2010, police became aware of a website for a company called ""Combat Australia"" which listed its business address as the same address as the Appellant's business address. As a result of what police observed on that website and checks run on the business, police applied for and were granted authority to conduct a controlled operation under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997.

25On 22 December 2010, an undercover police operative attended the Appellant's business premises and purchased a slingshot from the Appellant for the sum of $100.00. The undercover police operative also purchased a number of steel ball bearings from the Appellant for $50.00. The slingshot transaction was the first sale forming part of Count 1 on the indictment. It was an agreed fact that the slingshot was a prohibited weapon. 

26On 30 December 2010, the undercover police operative again attended the Appellant's business premises and purchased a box containing the components for a crossbow from the Appellant for the sum of $800.00. A number of arrows were also supplied by the Appellant. The box identified the contents as a ""Jaguar"" brand crossbow. This was the second sale for the purpose of Count 1. It is this item which gives rise to Ground 1. More will be said about it shortly.

27On 31 January 2011, the undercover police operative again attended the Appellant's business premises and purchased an assembled ""Jaguar"" brand crossbow from the Appellant for the sum of $800.00. A number of arrows were also supplied. This was the third sale relied upon in support of Count 1. It was an agreed fact that this item was a prohibited weapon.

28In conversations regarding the purchase of the assembled crossbow on 31 January 2011, the Appellant advised the undercover police operative that he should remove the limb or string and have it posted out to him in case he was stopped by police or, if he wanted to risk buying the item assembled, he should cover it with a blanket.

29The Appellant was arrested on 31 January 2011 and declined to participate in a recorded interview. Later that day, police executed a search warrant at the Appellant's business premises and seized three metallic items which the Crown alleged, in Counts 2-4 on the indictment, were crossbows, and thus prohibited weapons under the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. I will return to these items when considering Ground 2. 

Ground 1 - The Unassembled Crossbow Ground

30Count 1 on the indictment alleged an offence under s.23B Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 that, between 21 December 2010 and 1 February 2011 at Penrith in the State of New South Wales, the Appellant did on three separate occasions during a period of 12 months sell a prohibited weapon to another person. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years' imprisonment.

31As mentioned, the Appellant conceded that the slingshot and the assembled ""Jaguar"" brand crossbow were prohibited weapons within the meaning of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, but disputed that the box of components capable of being assembled into a ""Jaguar"" brand crossbow constituted a prohibited weapon within the meaning of that Act.

Prohibited Weapons Legislation in New South Wales

32Brief reference should be made to the legislative history concerning regulation of prohibited weapons in this State. 

33In 1989, the Firearms and Dangerous Weapons Act 1973 was repealed and replaced by the Firearms Act 1989 and the Prohibited Weapons Act 1989. At the same time, a number of serious firearms offences were transferred from the Firearms and Dangerous Weapons Act 1973 to the Crimes Act 1900. It had been decided that the regulation of firearms and prohibited weapons required separate legislation, in order to clearly identify what was seen as the ""difference between the regulation of legitimate firearms use and the need for strict controls and substantial penalties in regard to prohibited weapons"" (second reading speech, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 2 March 1989).

34Included in the ranks of prohibited weapons in Schedule 1 of the Prohibited Weapons Act 1989 was ""a crossbow, other than an antique crossbow"". 

35A ""slingshot"" was included in Schedule 1 of the Prohibited Weapons Act 1989 by the Prohibited Weapons Amendment (Dart Slingers and Slingshots) Regulation 1996. 

36The Prohibited Weapons Further Amendment Regulation 1997 amended the definition of ""crossbow"" to provide:

""An article or device commonly known as a crossbow, or any other article or device consisting of a bow fitted transversely on a stock that has a groove or barrel designed to direct an arrow or bolt.""

37Following the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, the Firearms Act 1989 was repealed and replaced by the Firearms Act 1996, as part of a national campaign to implement firearms control: R v Cromarty [2004] NSWCCA 54; 144 A Crim R 515 at 519 [15]; Thalari v R [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 314 [44].

38The Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 was enacted in 1998. In the second reading speech, the Minister observed that a taskforce had found that the Prohibited Weapons Act 1989 was ""inadequate and outmoded"", and that the 1998 Bill ""implements the recommendations of the taskforce for tougher legislation to protect the community against prohibited weapons"" (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 22 October 1998). The Minister continued:

""The bill will improve public safety by imposing stricter controls on the possession and use of prohibited weapons. In addition, the bill provides tough penalties for a range of prohibited weapons offences. The underlying principles of the bill are that the possession and use of prohibited weapons should be a privilege, and not a right, that is conditional on an overriding need to ensure public safety. The bill requires each applicant for a prohibited weapons permit to prove a genuine reason for possession or use of a prohibited weapon. It provides strict requirements that must be satisfied in relation to the possession and use of prohibited weapons, and it provides an amnesty period for the surrender of prohibited weapons to encourage their removal from the community.""

39The Minister observed that all weapons then currently prohibited under the Prohibited Weapons Act 1989 had been retained in the Bill, with some additions. No reference was made to crossbows or slingshots in the second reading speech.

40The Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 created new offences, including the offence of selling prohibited weapons. 

41The Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 was amended by the Weapons and Firearms Legislation Amendment Act 2010. The second reading speech with respect to the 2010 Bill referred to the report of the statutory review undertaken concerning the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, which had been tabled in the Legislative Assembly in June 2009. Recommendations made in that review had led to amendments to the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 effected in 2010. 

42The statutory review report is available extrinsic material: s.34(2)(b) Interpretation Act 1987. The statutory review report of June 2009 sheds some light upon the prohibition concerning crossbows in the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. The report stated at paragraph 2.2.3:

""During his first term as Minister for Police, the Hon John Watkins MP, successfully lobbied APMC in July 2003 to institute a national ban on all crossbows. Following a serious incident involving a crossbow in a school, all jurisdictions enacted legislative change to include crossbows as a banned or prohibited weapon. This act aligned those jurisdictions with the then NSW laws. At that time, only NSW and the ACT had banned all types of crossbows. Other jurisdictions had banned pistol crossbows but not the larger, non-concealable models.

Events, such as the crossbow incident, highlight the importance of cross-jurisdictional co-operation regarding uniform national prohibition legislation. Standardisation of legislation across jurisdictions has decreased the ease of the acquisition of such weapons.""

43In the Agreement in Principle speech concerning the 2010 Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary said (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 18 March 2010):

""The items currently classed as prohibited weapons range from certain types of specialist knives to tasers and knuckledusters. The list is a dynamic one and additions are made in response to operational feedback from police. For example, over the past few years items such as road spikes and laser pointers have been included as prohibited weapons. Through this bill, improvised explosive devices and taser-proof clothing are proposed additions to the schedule of prohibited weapons. As well as providing clear guidelines for the New South Wales Police Force, the schedule of prohibited weapons serves as guidelines for the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. In order to import any item on the schedule, Customs will require proof of police authorisation. This process is undertaken using a prescribed form.""

44Sections 23A and 23B Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 were introduced in 2010, thereby creating the offence of selling prohibited weapons on an ongoing basis, the offence charged in Count 1 punishable by imprisonment for 20 years. Introduction of offences now contained in ss.23A and 23B was recommended in the statutory review report of June 2009.

The Unassembled Crossbow

45The unassembled crossbow contained in a box labelled ""Jaguar Crossbow"" is depicted in photographs attached to the affidavit of Benjamin Craig sworn 13 February 2014 for the purpose of the appeal. The evidence was that the contents of the box, when assembled, constituted a complete crossbow. There were no missing parts. 

46The only issue with respect to Count 1 was whether an unassembled crossbow in this form fell within the definition of ""crossbow"", and thus ""prohibited weapon"", for the purposes of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. 

47Resolution of Ground 1 will be assisted by photographs of the box containing the ""Jaguar"" brand crossbow, and the unassembled contents of the box with the lid removed. These photographs were in evidence at trial: 


 
 
Construction of the term ""Crossbow"" in the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998

48The construction of the word ""crossbow"" in Schedule 1 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 commences with a consideration of the text itself, with regard to its context, including the general purpose and policy of the provision and the mischief it was seeking to remedy: Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Limited v Commissioner of Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; 239 CLR 27 at 46-47 [47].

49""Prohibited weapon"" means anything described in Schedule 1 to the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998: s.4(1). 

50Schedule 1 is divided under several headings - knives (clause 1), military-style weapons (clause 1A), miscellaneous weapons (clause 2), imitations, concealed blades etc (clause 3) and miscellaneous articles (clause 4).

51Clause 2(5) of Schedule 1 (under ""Miscellaneous weapons"") provides as follows:

""A crossbow (or any similar device) consisting of a bow fitted transversely on a stock that has a groove or barrel designed to direct an arrow or bolt.""

52The Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 contains a principles and objects provision. Section 3 provides as follows:

""Principles and objects of Act

(1) The underlying principles of this Act are:

(a) to confirm that the possession and use of prohibited weapons is a privilege that is conditional on the overriding need to ensure public safety, and

(b) to improve public safety by imposing strict controls on the possession and use of prohibited weapons.


(2) The specific objects of this Act are as follows:

(a) to require each person who possesses or uses a prohibited weapon under the authority of a permit to have a genuine reason for possessing or using the weapon,

(b) to provide strict requirements that must be satisfied in relation to the possession and use of prohibited weapons,

(c) to provide an amnesty period to enable the surrender of prohibited weapons.""

53On the face of it, application of these principles and objects would support an expansive, as opposed to a restrictive, construction of terms in the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, to give effect to the statutory principles and objects. 

54A question, however, is whether these principles and objects operate only with respect to items which are ""prohibited weapons"" as described in the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, with the statutory principles and objects not being capable of being brought into play until the item in question falls within the statutory definition construed strictly. As I understand it, that is RS Hulme AJ's position. I respectfully disagree.

55In the interpretation of a provision, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act) should be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object: s.33 Interpretation Act 1987.

56In my view, the principles and objects provision in s.3 is available to assist in determining the question whether an item is a ""prohibited weapon"", in accordance with s.33 Interpretation Act 1987. An objects clause such as s.3 should be given practical content in the understanding of terms in the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998: Russo v Aiello [2003] HCA 53; 215 CLR 643 at 645 [5]; ID, PF and DV v Director General, Department of Juvenile Justice [2008] NSWSC 966; 73 NSWLR 158 at 189 [255].

57Section 4(2) Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 is also relevant:

""(2) For the purposes of this Act:

(a) anything that would be a prohibited weapon if it did not have something missing from it, or a defect or obstruction in it, is taken to be a prohibited weapon, and

(b) a person in or on (or in or on any part of) any premises, vehicle, vessel or aircraft in which there is a prohibited weapon is to be regarded as having possession of the weapon unless the person proves otherwise, and

(c) if parts of a prohibited weapon are in the possession of, or are being carried by, 2 or more persons, each of those persons is to be regarded as possessing the weapon.""

58Section 4(2) does not address the situation where an individual is in possession of a complete, but unassembled, item such as a crossbow which, once assembled, would clearly fall within the definition of ""prohibited weapon"". However, s.4(2) operates to provide a measure of flexibility to extend the term ""prohibited weapon"" to include:

(a) an incomplete prohibited weapon, with something missing or a defect or obstruction, but for which it would otherwise be a ""prohibited weapon"" (s.4(2)(a));

(b) a scenario where parts of a prohibited weapon are in the possession, or being carried by, two or more persons, with each of those persons to be regarded as possessing the weapon in those circumstances (s.4(2)(c)).

59Section 4(2)(a) and (c) make clear that, at least in the circumstances covered by those provisions, an item may constitute a ""prohibited weapon"" even where it is incomplete (s.4(2)(a)) or broken into parts with the parts being possessed or carried by two or more persons (s.4(2)(c)). The concept of a complete but unassembled crossbow falling within the definition of ""crossbow"", and thus ""prohibited weapon"", does not seem distant from these provisions. 

60The inclusion of the words ""(or any similar device)"" in the definition of ""crossbow"" also suggests a definition with some flexibility, and not a fixed and inflexible verbal formula.

61It is noteworthy that the Schedule 1 definition of ""crossbow"" is close to the dictionary definition of the term. According to the Macquarie Dictionary, a ""crossbow"" is ""an old weapon for shooting missiles, consisting of a bow fixed transversely on a stock having a groove or barrel to direct the missile"".

62The word ""consist"", according to the Macquarie Dictionary, means ""to be made up or comprised (of)"" or ""to be comprised of or contained (in)"". 

63The Appellant's submission invites a strict construction of the definition of ""crossbow"", so as to require a completed object fitting the description in the definition. On this approach, the bow must be ""fitted transversely ..."", a statutory indicator that the component parts must be actually fitted together.

64The Crown submitted that a purposive construction ought be adopted, leading to the conclusion reached by the trial Judge. 

65The construction adopted by the trial Judge permits the statutory definition to be satisfied where the items sold included all the constituent parts so that, upon assembly, a working crossbow results.

66The definition of ""crossbow"" is silent as to whether an unassembled crossbow is included or excluded. Accordingly, it is necessary to construe the term, viewed in its statutory context, but with regard being had to the purpose or object of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 and the prohibition with respect to crossbows.

67It may be observed immediately that the definition of ""crossbow"" is not expressed in narrow terms. It includes ""any similar device"". Further, s.4(2)(a) and (c) Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 make clear that an item may be a ""prohibited weapon"" even though there is ""something missing from it, or a defect or obstruction in it"" or if the parts of a prohibited weapon are being carried by two or more persons. These provisions indicate a preparedness in the legislation for a definition to be satisfied, even if the item in question is not a complete, assembled and functioning item. 

68In my view, the ordinary meaning of the words used in the definition of ""crossbow"" are more than capable of accommodating the construction adopted by the trial Judge. The best that can be said for the strict construction is that there are two competing constructions which are open. Resort may be had to extrinsic material: Newcastle City Council v GIO General Limited [1997] HCA 53; 191 CLR 85 at 113.

69In my view, it is clear that the construction adopted by the trial Judge would promote the purpose or object of the legislation, whilst that advanced by the Appellant would not: s.33 Interpretation Act 1987.

70Indeed, the construction advanced by the Appellant would, in my view, give rise to an outcome which has particular resonance in this case. As McHugh J observed in Newcastle City Council v GIO General Limited at 113, ""if the target of a legislative provision is clear, the court's duty is to ensure that it is hit rather than to record that it has been missed"".

71In my view, it would require clear words in the definition of ""crossbow"", excluding an unassembled crossbow from the definition, before the Court should conclude that the item in question here fell outside the statutory definition. At the very least, there would need to be a stronger indicator than the mere use of the word ""fitted"", a term which, in my view, provides only equivocal support for the Appellant's construction.

72This approach is necessary to give effect to the purpose or object of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, having regard to the mischief to which the statute is directed.

73The High Court has stated that a purposive construction does not justify expanding the scope of a criminal offence beyond its textual limits: Milne v The Queen [2014] HCA 4; 88 ALJR 395 at 403 [38]. However, the construction advanced by the Crown, which I accept, does not expand the scope of this criminal offence beyond its textual limits, considered in the context of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 itself.

74It may be readily inferred that the ""Jaguar"" brand crossbow was commercially manufactured and provided to persons such as the Appellant for sale in a marked box. 

75The contents of the box (as depicted in the photograph) disclose an orderly set of contents accompanied by instructions for assembly. To confine the definition of ""crossbow"" in the manner contended for by the Applicant in this case would, in my view, operate strongly against the purpose of the statute. 

76It is understandable that the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 would seek to extend descriptions of prohibited weapons in this way in an effort to suppress the possession, use and sale of items which are prohibited weapons. 

77The present case is a good illustration of this. The Appellant sold to the undercover police operative a complete crossbow, boxed and unassembled, with the clear capacity for the item to be put together and function as a crossbow falling directly within the Schedule 1 definition. Indeed, the Appellant appears to have been alive to the definitional issue in that he advised the undercover police operative, on 31 January 2011, in the context of the purchase of an assembled ""Jaguar"" brand crossbow and arrows, that the customer should remove the limb or string and have them posted to him separately in case he was stopped by police. Of course, this suggested avoidance strategy was itself misconceived as it overlooks s.4(2)(a) Weapons Prohibition Act 1998.

78The strict construction, which I do not favour, would clearly assist avoidance of the scheme for statutory prohibition, by permitting an item which a reasonable citizen would regard as a crossbow, to be sold in a manner which defeated the legislation, merely because it had not been assembled.

79Having regard to the mischief at which the legislation is directed, such a strict construction would not promote the purpose or object of the legislation and should not be preferred. 

80I would reject the ground of appeal which contends that the commercially produced, boxed, but unassembled, ""Jaguar"" brand crossbow was not a ""prohibited weapon"" for the purpose of Count 1.

81The construction favoured by the trial Judge is correct. Ground 1 should be rejected.

Ground 2 - The Metallic Items Ground

82The Appellant, in Ground 2, challenges the finding of the trial Judge that the three metallic items, the subject of Counts 2, 3 and 4 fell within the definition of ""crossbow"" under the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. 

83In rejecting a submission at the close of the Crown case, the trial Judge said with respect to these items (Judgment, 18 September 2012, page 3):

""Dealing with the items in exhibit F from an examination of one of those items it can be seen that there are two wings or appendages which are affixed to the stock with hinges or pivots. When the locking mechanism is released those wings or appendages extend forward and lock in such a manner as to form a single curve or arch attached to which is the string or cable. It is clear from examination of the item that it is clearly designed to direct an arrow or bolt.

Something which lies transversely to an item lies across it, not necessarily on top of it but nonetheless crossing it. The bow of the metallic item clearly lies transversely to the stock, not on top of it as I have said but at the commencement of the stock.

What is clear is that the device consists of a bow fitted transversely to the stock, that is at the nose of the stock which has a groove or a barrel designed to direct an arrow or bolt and therefore clearly falls within the definition of a prohibited weapon.""

84In her judgment finding the Appellant guilty of Counts 2, 3 and 4, the trial Judge described the metallic items as ""crudely made items"" and observed that the ""string or cable was poorly tensioned"" (Judgment, 19 September 2012, page 10).

85The critical findings of the trial Judge concerning the metallic items, the subject of Counts 2, 3 and 4 in the judgment on conviction were as follows (pages 12-13):

""The evidence in this case of course includes the physical items tendered in the Crown case. To simply look at the items contained in exhibit F it defies logic to suggest that they are items other than crossbows. They are clearly items which have a bow, albeit a bow comprised of two parts which forms a bow which transverses a stock, albeit at the end rather than on top of or across the stock; they have a groove or a barrel designed to direct an arrow or bolt, albeit a modified arrow or bolt; and taking into account the evidence in the Crown case and a physical examination by me of the items tendered, I find myself satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the items are crossbows and therefore as such are prohibited weapons.

The definition of a crossbow does not require that the bow must be a single bow as such. That is one continuous bow not comprised of parts. These items when the metallic object is expanded by use of the spring opening mechanism forms a single bow, and that is plain to see. And it just so happens that it consists of two parts to form that single bow. The definition requires that the bow is fitted transverse to the stock. The definition does not stipulate how. Upon inspection of the metallic items it is also plain to see. Even Mr Garland reluctantly conceded that the middle section of the metallic item could comprise a stock and I find that that is so. There is no real dispute about the items having a groove or a barrel designed to direct an arrow or bolt. That was the relevance of the testing, not the functionality of the items, but to satisfy me whether or not they were designed to direct an arrow or bolt and I find myself so satisfied.""

86In approaching this ground of appeal, I have regard to the conclusions reached under Ground 1 concerning the proper construction of the word ""crossbow"" in Schedule 1 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. 

87The three metallic items are somewhat different from the commercially manufactured unassembled crossbow considered in Ground 1. 

88However, I am not persuaded that these items fall outside the definition of ""crossbow"" in the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. The description of the trial Judge is accurate and brings the items within the statutory formula. 

89I would reject Ground 2.

Ground 3 - Claim of Procedural Unfairness

90Ground 3 challenges the approach adopted by the trial Judge to the expert evidence given at trial and, in particular, that of Mr Garland called on behalf of the Appellant. 

91Like RS Hulme AJ, I am doubtful that much (if any) of the opinion evidence given by expert witnesses was admissible in the trial. 

92The sole issue with respect to Count 1 was whether the commercially manufactured and boxed unassembled crossbow fell within the definition of ""crossbow"" in Schedule 1 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. There was no issue that the item, when assembled, functioned as a crossbow. I do not detect any area where opinion evidence could bear upon what was essentially a legal question to be determined by the trial Judge.

93With respect to the metallic items, the subject of Counts 2, 3 and 4, there was scope for some factual evidence concerning the operation of these items and their capacity to fire arrows or bolts, issues bearing upon the factual and legal question as to whether they fell within the definition of ""crossbow"" in Schedule 1 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. 

94It is the case that the trial Judge made some criticisms of Mr Garland and his evidence in the course of the judgment on conviction. However, I am not persuaded that the matters complained of bear upon any issue of substance to be determined at the trial. Opinion evidence could not meaningfully assist the trial Judge in the determination of the real issues in the trial.

95To the extent that Ground 3 (as it must) asserts that there was a miscarriage of justice for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, arising from the matters complained of under that ground, I am not satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated in the circumstances of this case. I reject Ground 3.

Conclusion on Conviction Appeal

96Having rejected each ground of appeal against conviction, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 

Application for Leave to Appeal Against Sentence

97As I have reached a different conclusion to the other members of the Court with respect to the conviction appeal, Grounds 5 and 6 remain alive, together with Grounds 4 and 7, all of which bear upon the question of sentence. However, as I am in a minority, my conclusions may be expressed briefly.

98The maximum penalty for an offence under s.23B Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 is imprisonment for 20 years. Somewhat curiously, there is no standard non-parole period for this offence, unlike the equivalent ongoing sale offence contained in s.51B Firearms Act 1996 (where there is a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years applies).

99The only standard non-parole period in the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 applies to offences of unauthorised possession or use of a prohibited weapon under s.7, as to which, as RS Hulme AJ observes at [124], a standard non-parole period of three years applies. Counts 2, 3 and 4 were offences of this type.

100With respect to Ground 5, which complains that inadequate regard was given by her Honour to the limited and clearly identified basis upon which the trial was conducted, I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated. 

101The practical parameters of the trial were confined realistically by the nature of the Crown case. Even if the Crown had been put to strict proof on all aspects, it is doubtful that the trial would have occupied much longer (as a Judge-alone trial) than it did here. Mr Game SC did not contend that any numerical discount ought to have been allowed for this aspect, but that it should have been taken into account in light of s.22(3)(l) and s.23A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am not persuaded that any error is demonstrated in this respect. 

102Ground 6 complains of an inappropriately higher level of objective seriousness being accorded to Counts 2, 3 and 4 given what is said to have been the wholly ineffectual nature of the items in question. 

103The evidence adduced at first instance included a DVD showing the weapons being tested. These items were designed to direct an arrow or bolt. Even if they were not outstanding examples of weapons of this type, they had the capacity to perform in the manner described by the trial Judge in her judgment on conviction (see [85] above).

104In any event, the sentences imposed upon each of Counts 2, 3 and 4 were entirely concurrent as between themselves and were subsumed within the sentence imposed upon Count 1. I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated in accordance with Ground 6.

105Ground 7 complains with respect to the sentences imposed for the offences under s.36(1) Firearms Act 1996 (two concurrent fixed terms of 18 months' imprisonment), that her Honour erred in failing to set a non-parole period as required by s.44(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and by failing to state any reasons for deciding to set a fixed term as required by s.45(2) of that Act.

106This ground involves a technical challenge to the sentences in question. No standard non-parole period attaches to offences under s.36(1) Firearms Act 1996. The failure of a court to comply with the requirement to give reasons under s.45(2) does not invalidate the sentence: s.45(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

107When sentencing an offender for multiple offences, and where some accumulation is appropriate, it is acceptable to impose fixed terms of imprisonment for some of the sentences. This is because, if a sentence containing a non-parole period and a parole period was set for each offence, the parole terms of many of these sentences would be subsumed in a non-parole period or fixed term of some longer sentences: R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 346 at [161]. 

108In the context of this case, I agree with the Crown submission that a technical error of this type is of little or no practical importance. The sentencing Judge was required to sentence the Appellant for a number of offences, keeping in mind issues of concurrency, accumulation and totality. In this context, the use of fixed terms of imprisonment is understandable. Although her Honour did not state expressly this was the reason for taking this course, it may be inferred readily that this is what occurred. 

109I am not persuaded that the technical error involved in Ground 7 is one which would require reconsideration to be given to the sentences affected by this ground. I observe, in any event, that the concurrent fixed terms for the s.36(1) offences were subsumed within the sentence imposed upon Count 1.

110Ground 4 contends that the sentences imposed for each matter individually, and collectively, were manifestly excessive. RS Hulme AJ has addressed a number of issues which bear upon the resolution of this ground.

111It is to be kept in mind that, to make good this ground, it is for the Appellant to demonstrate that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust.

112I approach this ground, of course, upon the basis that the Appellant remains convicted of all offences for which he stood to be sentenced in the District Court. The total effective sentence imposed by her Honour for all the Appellant's offences comprised a head sentence of four years and six months' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of two years and six months expiring on 28 July 2015. 

113I note that the orders proposed by the other members of the Court, allowing for sentences remaining after the quashing of convictions, will see a total effective sentence of three years and six months' imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years expiring on 29 January 2015. 

114For the purpose of this judgment, the Appellant remains convicted of all offences for which he was sentenced in the District Court. Those offences include the offence under s.23B Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, for which the maximum penalty is 20 years' imprisonment, and the three offences of possession of a prohibited weapon, being Counts 2, 3 and 4 on the indictment relating to the metallic items, for which a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment applies with a standard non-parole period of three years.

115I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed upon the Appellant for all the offences of which he was convicted or pleaded guilty is unreasonable or plainly unjust, by reference to the total effective sentence and non-parole period. There was a very great degree of concurrency as between the various sentences. Given that my judgment expresses a minority view, I will not proceed further to expand upon my reasons for this conclusion. 

116The orders which I propose are as follows:

(a) appeal against conviction dismissed;

(b) leave to appeal against sentence granted, but appeal dismissed.

117RS HULME AJ. These reasons relate to an appeal against conviction and an application to appeal against sentence imposed by English DCJ on 1 February 2013. The circumstances giving rise to the appellant's conviction and sentence were as follows: -

(a) On 22 December 2010 an undercover operative purchased a slingshot from the appellant for $100.00 and a large number of steel ball bearings for $50.00.

(b) On 30 December 2010 the undercover operative purchased a number of unassembled items and arrows in a box for $800.00. The box was labelled ""Jaguar Crossbow"". The Crown contended and English DCJ found that the unassembled items constituted a crossbow.

(c) On 31 January 2011 the undercover operative purchased an assembled Jaguar brand crossbow and arrows for $800.00. At the time of the purchase the Applicant advised the operative that he should remove the limb or string and have them posted to him separately in case he was stopped by police or that if he wanted to take the risk of buying the crossbow assembled he should ""chuck a blanket over it"" as he took it away from the premises. 

(d) Also on 31 January 2011 the Appellant agreed to sell to the undercover operative a 30.30 lever action Winchester rifle for $1,000.00.

(e) Later on 31 January the appellant was arrested. During the execution of a search warrant at the appellant's business premises, police found a 30.30 lever action Winchester rifle unsecured in a cardboard box together with 10 slingshots, three metallic items found by Her Honour to be cross bows, a large number of crossbow bolts or arrows and a large number of steel ball bearings capable of being used in conjunction with the slingshots. It was agreed between counsel that the rifle was that which the Appellant had earlier that day agreed to sell to the undercover operative.

(f) During the execution of the search warrant at the appellant's residential premises, police found a number of other slingshots.

(g) At the time, the appellant held a NSW shooters license. Nine other firearms, all of which were registered in the appellant's name and found appropriately stored, were also seized.

118There was no dispute that the slingshot in paragraph (a) and the crossbow referred to in paragraph (c) were prohibited weapons and that the Appellant sold them as described. His counsel indicated that, considered as individual offences, the Appellant was prepared to plead guilty to them. The Appellant also did not dispute evidence that her Honour accepted to the effect that the unassembled items were all that were necessary to make a functioning crossbow and that when assembled later by an officer of the Police Forensic Services Group, they did so. He did however dispute that the unassembled items referred to in paragraph (b) did, in that state, constitute a crossbow.

119There was also an issue whether the three metallic items found on 31 January constituted crossbows. As found by the police each included what could fairly be described as a stock. There was no bow attached but there were two arms attached, one on each side, near the front of the stock and lying more or less parallel to the stock. These arms did not touch each other but could pivot at or near the point of attachment which seems to have been a bolt. When pivoted sufficiently, most of the end of each arm closest to the stock would lie at approximately 90 degrees to the stock. Each arm was curved and when pivoted sufficiently, in combination with the width of the stock at about the point of attachment to it they formed a shape of or similar to that of a bow. The arms did not touch each other. Mr Garland, a weapons dealer, called on the Appellant's behalf described the extended arms as a ""bow"", albeit one that did not ""transverse"" the stock. 

120The events referred to led to a number of charges, four on an indictment and four the subject of Court Attendance Notices. The events in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) led to Count 1 on the indictment, a charge of, on three separate occasions during a 12-month period, selling a prohibited weapon. To this charge, the Appellant pleaded not guilty. He admitted that the items referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) were prohibited weapons and the sole issue was that referred to above, viz. whether in the form they were in when the Appellant had possession of them, the unassembled items purchased on 30 December 2010 constituted a crossbow. On this issue English DCJ found in favour of the Crown and in respect of the charge imposed a sentence of four years including a non-parole period of two years both such terms commencing on 29 July 2013. The charge arose pursuant to s.23B of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 and carried a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment. 

121CAN 6 - the full number can at this stage be omitted - contained a charge of agreeing to sell an unregistered firearm being the rifle referred to in sub-paragraph (d). The Appellant pleaded guilty to this charge and was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing on 29 January 2013. The offence was one arising under s.36(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years.

122CAN 3 contained a charge of possessing an unregistered firearm, being the rifle found as referred to in sub-paragraph (e). To this charge also the Appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a similar term of 18 months concurrent with that referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. This offence also arose under s.36(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years.

123CAN 4 contained a charge of not taking all reasonable precautions to keep that same firearm safely. To this the Appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of six months commencing on 29 January 2013. The offence was one arising under s.39(1)(a) of the Firearms Act 1996 and carried a maximum penalty of a $2,200.00 fine and imprisonment for 12 months. 

124CAN 2 contained a charge of possessing a prohibited weapon, viz. a slingshot, and also arose out of the events referred to in sub-paragraph (e). To this also the Appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for two-and-a-half years including a non-parole period of 12 months both such periods commencing on 29 April 2014. The offence was one arising under s.7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. A standard non-parole period of three years has been ordained for such an offence.

125Counts 2 to 4 on the indictment were three charges of possessing prohibited weapon, viz. crossbows, arising out of the finding of the three metallic items referred to in sub-paragraph (e). To these the Appellant pleaded not guilty. He was found guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for concurrent terms of two-and-a-half years including non-parole periods of 12 months all such periods commencing on 29 April 2013. The charges arose pursuant to s.7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 and each carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. The standard non-parole period of three years mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph applied.

126The effective sentence this imposed was one of four years and six months including non-parole periods totalling two years and six months. Her Honour also made orders that the Appellant pay the sum of $900.00 by way of pecuniary penalty and for the forfeiture and destruction of the weapons.

127The grounds of appeal were:

(a) With respect to the first count on the indictment the trial judge erred in finding that a set of parts capable of being made into a crossbow was a crossbow within the meaning of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998.

(b) With respect to the second, third and fourth counts on the indictment the trial judge erred in finding that the devices in question were crossbows within the meaning of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. (These devices were the three metallic devices found on 31 January 2011).

(c) With respect to each of the counts on the indictment the trial judge erred in her treatment of the expert evidence in that:

(i) her Honour denied natural justice to the appellant by not giving Mr Garland an opportunity to respond to matters she later relied upon in dealing with his evidence;

(ii) her Honour failed to analyse adequately or at all the competing positions of the Crown and defence weapons experts;

(iii) her Honour failed to have proper regard to the evidence of Mr Garland on the issues to be determined. 

(d) With respect to each of the matters for which the appellant was sentenced the sentences individually and overall were manifestly excessive.

128Originally, the sole ground of appeal against sentence was that last quoted. During the course of the appeal leave was sought to rely on three additional Grounds of Appeal, viz.

""5. With respect to each of the matters for which the appellant was sentenced after trial her Honour erred in that she gave inadequate regard to the limited and clearly identified basis on which the trial was conducted as required under s22 (3)(I) and s22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999;

6. With respect to the sentences imposed for the second, third and fourth counts on the indictment her Honour erred in regarding the offences as being of inappropriately high objective seriousness given the wholly ineffectual nature of the items in question.

7. With respect to the sentences imposed for the offences against s36 (1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (two concurrent fixed terms of 18 months) her Honour erred in failing to set a non-parole period as required by s44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and in failing to state any reasons for decided to set a fixed term as required by s45(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.""

129The Crown took no objection to the further grounds and accordingly leave should be given to the Appellant to amend. 



Ground 1

130A number of provisions of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 were relied on. Section 3 sets out in a number of paragraphs the underlying principles and specific objects of the Act. By way of example, paragraph 2(b) states as one of the objects, ""to provide strict requirements that must be satisfied in relation to the possession and use of prohibited weapons"". All of the paragraphs are similarly couched by reference to ""prohibited weapons"".

131Section 7 of the Act provides that a person must not possess or use a prohibited weapon unless authorised to do so by permit. ""Prohibited Weapon"" is defined in Section 4 as meaning anything described in Schedule 1. Schedule 1 makes reference to, inter alia:

""A Slingshot (being a device consisting of an elasticised band secured to the forks of a 'Y' shaped frame), other than a home made slingshot for use by a child in the course of play.

A crossbow (or any similar device) consisting of a bow fitted transversely on a stock that has a groove or barrel designed to direct an arrow or bolt.

A Flail or any other similar article that consists of a staff or handle that has fitted to one end, by any means, a freely swinging striking part that is armed with spikes or studded with any protruding matter.

Kung fu sticks or 'nunchaku', or any other similar article consisting of 2 or more sticks or bars made of any material that are joined together by any means that allows the sticks or bars to swing independently of each other, but not including any such article that is produced and identified as a children's toy.""


132Section 4(2) provides that:

""For the purposes of this Act:

(a) anything that would be a prohibited weapon if it did not have something missing from it or a defect or obstruction in it, is taken to be a prohibited weapon, and 

(b) a person in or on (or in or on any part of) and premises, vehicle, vessel or aircraft in which there is a prohibited weapon is to be regarded as having possession of the weapon unless the person proves otherwise, and 

(c) if parts of a prohibited weapon are in the possession of, or are being carried by, 2 or more persons, each of those persons is to be regarded as possessing the weapon.""

133Except as indicated, there is nothing in the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 dealing with the component parts of prohibited weapons. 

134It may also be noted that although some detachable firearm magazines are included in Schedule 1, the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 does not include firearms as ""Prohibited Weapons"".

135The Firearms Act 1996 deals with the possession, use, supply and other dealings with firearms including items falling within the description ""Prohibited Firearms"". Section 4 contains a definition of ""Firearm"" and also of ""Firearm Part"" the latter meaning:

""A barrel, breach, pistol slide, frame, receiver, cylinder, trigger mechanism, operating mechanism or magazine designed as, or reasonably capable of forming, part of a firearm.""

136Additional to those sections directed to the dealing in firearms, ss.50AA, 50B, 51BA and 51BB of the Firearms Act 1996 prohibit the purchase and supply in various circumstances of ""firearm parts"". Section 50A prohibits the manufacture of a firearm except under license. The various provisions dealing with ""firearm parts"" were introduced, variously, in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2013.

137In essence the argument for the Appellant before English DCJ and in this Court was that even if the items in the box sold on 30 December could, when assembled, amount to a crossbow, in the state they were when the Appellant had possession or was dealing with them they did not fall within the definition of ""crossbow"". 

138In that connection, emphasis was placed on the words ""fitted"" and ""transversely"" in the description of ""crossbow"". It was further contended that in a penal statute, if it was intended that the possession of parts merely capable of being turned into a prohibited weapon should be an offence, Parliament should have said so, as it has in the case of firearms. 

139In response, the Crown drew attention to the terms of s.4(2) set out above and submitted that it would be absurd if an offence occurred when parts of a prohibited weapon were in the possession of two people but not if they were all in the possession of one.

140The Appellant's answer was to return to the definition of ""Crossbow"", to submit that some limitation had to be imposed on the bare terms on s.4(2)(a) and that, as Parliament had chosen in s.4(2)(c) to include the words ""two of more persons"", the various provisions could not be construed so as to apply when only one had possession of or carried the relevant parts. 

141In my view the Appellant's submissions are to be preferred. Able to phrase the Act in any terms it chose, Parliament has defined a crossbow in the terms it has. At the time the Appellant had possession of and sold the items on 30 December, relied on as constituting the second of the transactions the subject of the first charge, the Appellant did not have a ""bow fitted transversely on a stock"" which is part of the definition of crossbow.

142The fact that the parts could have been fitted together and then could have formed a crossbow is nothing to the point. The parts were not a crossbow when the Appellant had possession of them. To quote an example given during the course of argument, a box of parts bought from Ikea and which, when assembled, form a bookcase is not a bookcase until the assembly occurs. 

143Nor do the words ""or any similar device"" assist the Crown. Positioned where they are in the description, they also are governed by the words ""consisting of a bow fitted transversely ..."".

144Section 4(2)(c) also must be given an operation in accordance with its terms. One cannot construe the reference to ""two or more persons"" as including only one person.

145The exact operation of s.4(2)(a) is not as simple to determine. Thus, to take the definition of a slingshot by way of example, one could not fairly regard every elasticised band as a slingshot, treating the absence of an attached ""Y"" shaped frame as overcome by the terms of s.4(2)(a). Similarly, one could not regard every staff or handle in the community as a flail, or every stick or bar as Kung Fu sticks upon the basis that the absence of the other parts included in the description of those items was covered by that sub-paragraph. 

146Furthermore if everything that was part of a prohibited weapon was, by virtue of s.4(2)(a) to be taken to be prohibited weapon, then s.4(2)(c) would be unnecessary. Each of the two or more persons who was carrying or in possession of a part of the weapon would, by virtue of s.4(2)(a) be taken to be carrying or have possession of the weapon. 

147Thus there must be some limitations in the operation of s.4(2)(a). The difficulty is to determine what they are. Normal statutory construction principles and s.8 of the Interpretation Act 1987 require that ""something"" include more than one component but given the sorts of problems that would arise if paragraph 4(2)(a) were applied without limitation, it seems to me that the ""something missing"" must be confined so that what remains is in substance a ""prohibited weapon"". To illustrate, albeit by an article that is dealt with in the Firearms Act 1996 rather than the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (and ignoring the specific provisions of the Firearms Act 1996 dealing with parts), a rifle would still be a firearm even if the bolt or firing pin or both were missing but those items would not themselves be firearms in circumstances where all the remaining parts, barrel, stock, magazine, trigger mechanism etc were missing. In the case of a crossbow, the fact of, say, a missing string, would not prevent the balance of the item being a crossbow, but the absence of a bow or stock would do so.
148An alternate view is to require that the component under consideration have been at one stage part of a (complete) prohibited weapon, from which other part(s) have been detached and therefore can be regarded as missing. Such an approach would solve the difficulties attendant upon the examples of elasticised bands, staffs, handles sticks and bars referred to above. 

149However, there was no evidence that the unassembled items purchased on 30 December 2010 had ever been put together so as to constitute a cross-bow so, whichever of the interpretations just expressed be adopted those unassembled items, either in totality or individually, did not constitute a crossbow and the Appellant's conviction on the first count was wrong and must be set aside. 

150In so concluding, I am not unconscious of the decisions of Barr AJ in DPP v Morgan [2013] NSWSC 1474 and of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Mezzadri [2011] NSWCCA 125; (2011) 210 A Crim R 442. The former case was one involving the Firearms Act 1996, s.4(2) parts of which are for all practical purposes identical with s.4(2)(a) and (c) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. Barr AJ held that the fact that there was missing from an unassembled collection of the component parts of a rifle, an integral part without which the rifle could not operate, did not prevent the balance constituting a firearm. 

151In R v Mezzadri, by way of obiter, Adams J with the concurrence of the other members of the Court remarked at [18] that ""a gun stock or trigger guard alone would arguably nevertheless be a firearm for the purposes of the [Firearms] Act, as much as would a completely operable machine gun"". 

152While conscious of the attraction of simply following these cases, it does not seem to me appropriate to do so in the context of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 as that Act encompasses a far more disparate collection of items than the Firearms Act 1996. I have indicated the sort of difficulties that would arise if one were to do so.
153I should add that the Crown's argument is not advanced by reference to the principles and objects of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. Referring as those principles and objects do to ""prohibited weapons"", s.3 gives no assistance in the determination of what are ""prohibited weapons"" or why ""crossbow"" should be given a meaning different from that which Parliament has specified. 

Ground 2

154This ground also must be upheld. Although I accept that a number of pieces of material, commonly wood, can be joined together and could form a bow, I doubt if that is a proper description of the two arms in this case, joined as they were to the stock which was in between them. In any event any bow consisting of the arms and part of the stock was not ""fitted transversely on a stock"". 

Ground 3

155In light of the conclusions at which I have arrived, it is unnecessary to explore this ground or to detail the evidence given by the experts called by the parties or the matters relied on. It may be appropriate to say however that I doubt the admissibility of much of the evidence given by the weapons experts.

Appeal against Sentence

156Given the conclusions expressed above, Grounds 5 and 6 are no longer relevant. However the conclusion arrived at in respect of Count 1 make relevant ss.23A and a number of parts of 23B(3) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. These provide: 

""(1) Prohibited weapons generally A person (the seller) must not sell a prohibited weapon to anther person (the buyer) unless:

(a) the buyer is authorised to possess the weapon by a permit, and 

(b) the seller:

(i) has seen the buyer's permit, or

(ii) knows that the buyer is an authorised weapons dealer or authorised theatrical weapons armourer 

The maximum penalty: imprisonment for 14 years.

(2) Military-style weapons A person (the seller) must not sell a military-style weapon to another person (the buyer) unless:

(a) the buyer is authorised to possess the weapon by a permit, and 

(b) the seller:

(i) has seen the buyer's permit, or

(ii) knows that the buyer is an authorised weapons dealer or authorised theatrical weapons armourer 

The maximum penalty: imprisonment for 20 years.

....

23B

(3) If, on the trial of a person for an offence under this section, the jury is not satisfied that the offence is proved but is satisfied that the person has, in respect of any of the occasions relied on as evidence of commission of the offence under this section, committed a relevant selling offence, the jury may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of the relevant selling offence, and the person is liable to punishment accordingly.""

157It follows that the Appellant falls to be sentenced for selling the slingshot and Jaguar crossbow referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above. As has been said he admitted the ingredients of these offences and was, and remains, willing to plead guilty to them. 

158Relevant to any decision as to what sentences should be imposed for those offences and to the contention that (all of) the sentences individually and overall were manifestly excessive, it is appropriate to refer to some further matters and findings of her Honour. 

159The Appellant had established a website called ""Combat Australia"" which attracted the police interest in him. In conversations associated with the purchase of the items on 30 December and 31 January the Appellant had advised the purchaser that he should remove the string and have it posted out to him in case he was stopped by police or that if he wanted to take the risk of buying the whole thing assembled, then he should ""chuck a blanket"" over it. The number of items dealt with or found by the police, and the circumstances detailed above indicate that the offences were committed in the course of a commercial operation. 

160The Appellant was a registered shooter and based on this and his advice to the purchaser of the crossbow her Honour found that that Appellant well knew he was acting against the law. Given the use of unregistered firearms by criminals and that the Appellant had no way of knowing who the ultimate purchaser of his weapons might be, her Honour said that the Appellant's conduct in respect of the firearm was an act of immense social irresponsibility and had the potential to cause significant risk to the community. She observed that the sale of the crossbow displayed a reckless disregard for public safety, having earlier observed that:

""A cross bow is capable of being loaded quickly and fired with precision. It is capable of causing significant injury or harm. It is not unheard of that a cross bow has been used in the commission of a serious criminal offence. Some years ago a young girl was shot by a school boyfriend in the playground at a Raymond Terrace high school with a cross bow.""

161Later her Honour remarked: 

""Submissions were made regarding the imposition of an intensive corrections order. The difficulty that the offender faces in that regard is that for such an option to become available the sentences to be imposed must be for two years or less. I find his offending behaviour is such that first a custodial penalty is the only appropriate punishment available but, secondly, that the totality of the sentences to be imposed will all [sic] above a two year term thereby rendering the offender ineligible to serve his sentence by way of other than full time custody.""

162Her Honour also recorded that the Appellant: 

"" ... now has a significant criminal record, which, of course, will impact upon his prospects for employment, overseas travel and perhaps even involvement with his children in their educational and sporting activities once he is released from custody. He will not longer be able to pursue recreational shooting and his criminal behaviour may even cost him his marriage"".

163Turning to other matters, the appellant was 37-years old at the time of sentence, married with two children and no prior criminal antecedents. He was educated to Year 12, employed by the Defence Department for a number of years and at the time of his arrest, carrying on his own importing business. He provided however, no explanation for his offending. 

164Her Honour accepted that the Applicant had contributed significantly to the community through volunteering and charitable organisations, that he was remorseful, of good character, his prospects for rehabilitation are good and he is highly unlikely to re-offend. Indeed there were unchallenged references put before her Honour as evidence that the Appellant had donated thousands of dollars in money and kind to charities and schools. 

165Her Honour referred also to evidence that the Appellant had suffered from anxiety and depression since childhood and had been diagnosed with dysthymia. Her Honour found however that there was no basis for concluding that this contributed to the offending but that the Appellant's time in custody might be more onerous in consequence. On this account, a need for the Appellant to attend for assessment, treatment and psychotherapy, and because this would be the Appellant's first time in custody and the accumulation of sentences, her Honour found special circumstances.

166One matter to which her Honour seems not to have adverted was that, with the exception of the charge under s.23B of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, all of the offences with which she was dealing could have been dealt with in the Local Court. Listed in Table 2 to Schedule 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, all but the offence of not taking reasonable precautions to keep a firearm safely were, by s.260(2) required to be so dealt with unless the Prosecutor elected to have them dealt with on indictment. The maximum penalty for the precautions offence was two years and thus in the normal course it also would have been dealt with summarily. No doubt it was before English DCJ as an offence ""related"" to others her Honour was dealing with - see s.165 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, et seq.

167Section 23A(1) is also one of the provisions listed in Table 2. 

168In light of this, the Court's conclusion that the convictions for the most serious offence charged and the other offences on the indictment should be quashed, her Honour's decision that a custodial sentence was called for must be reconsidered. That said, the decision was clearly correct. There can be no doubt that the principles and objects of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, the maximum penalties provided for his offences together with the obvious problem that weapons cause in the community and the deliberate and significant criminality in which the Appellant engaged argue convincingly for a custodial sentence.

169On the other hand half of his offences related to slingshots and a crossbow, weapons that are not commonly - indeed one may say rarely - associated with crime other than the weapons' own use. I of course accept that, as demonstrated by the example to which her Honour referred, they may be so used but the general proposition just stated remains true. Furthermore, I am by no means convinced that her Honour was correct in the statement she made that ""... a crossbow is capable of being loaded quickly ..."". There was no evidence before her Honour to that effect and a demonstration by police of the use of one of the metallic items recorded on a DVD in evidence suggested that loading one of those weapons was by no means a speedy task. Certainly, any pistol or rifle would be far more convenient to use.

170The Judicial Commission statistics show that in the period October 2009 to September 2013, 405 offenders were dealt with in the Local Court and only eight in the superior courts for the offence under s.36(1) of possessing an unregistered firearm. Only 25 of the former group went to prison, 17 of these receiving sentences of 12 months or less, while six of the eight did. In that latter group sentences were fairly evenly spread between one and three-and-a-half years. 

171The statistics show that in the same period seven offenders were dealt with in the Local Court and none in the superior courts for selling an unregistered firearm. There was one offender dealt with in the superior courts for conspiracy to sell or purchase such a firearm. Of the seven, only two were sent to prison, one for three months and one for eight months. The offender guilty of the conspiracy was sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years. 

172In the period October 2009 to September 2013, 1,003 offenders were dealt with in the Local Court for possessing or using a prohibited weapon and, since the introduction of the standard non-parole period, 22 in the superior courts. Only 55 of the 1,003 and 10 of the 22 were sent to prison. Of the 55, three received sentences of two years, two received sentences of 18 months, one received a sentence of 15 months and 11 received a sentence of 12 months. The sentences on the balance were shorter.

173Of the 10 sentenced in the superior courts to imprisonment, one received a sentence of eight years, four received sentences of three years and two received sentences of two-and-a-half years. The sentences on the other offenders were shorter.

174The sentence of eight years, which included a non-parole period of five years, was imposed on a former member of the army who, following his appropriation of the weapons, had possession of 10 rocket launchers containing rockets, capable of travelling 1,100 metres and containing explosives capable of penetrating 28 cm of steel plate. The offender had disposed of the weapons which, this Court inferred, remained in the possession of criminals and which were dangerous and life threatening and the only reasonable use of which was for criminal or terrorist activities. There had been a plea of guilty. This Court held that the sentence was not manifestly excessive - see Della-Vedova v R [2009] NSWCCA 107. 

175Hence the Appellant's offences now to be dealt with could well have been prosecuted in the Local Court. However, when regard is had to the totality of his offending and that it occurred as an incident of a business he was running in dealing in either unregistered firearms or prohibited weapons, it is impossible to say that the Local Court was the most appropriate venue. Accordingly I do not regard the fact that the remaining charges could have been dealt with in the Local Court as an argument in mitigation - see Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 460; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [109].

176The statistics do suggest that the sentences imposed on the Applicant were relatively severe. However, inevitably the statistics do not provide any information as to the details of the offences or offenders reflected in them. Importantly, they do not indicate whether the offences were incurred in the course of a significant commercial operation. They provide at best but limited guidance.

177Against the statutory penalty of five years' imprisonment the commercial nature of the Appellant's offending makes it impossible to regard the sentence of a fixed term of 18 months' imprisonment for selling an unregistered rifle as outside the legitimate exercise of English DCJ's discretion, and this even taking into account the favourable matters that could be put on the Appellants' behalf. Given it was made concurrent, the same may be said for the 18-month sentence for possession of that weapon. 

178In that connection it is appropriate to observe that rifles and pistols are by far the most common form of firearm that is not a prohibited firearm and while pistols might be thought to be more of a menace to the community, the penalty for possessing or selling an unregistered pistol is double that prescribed for possessing or selling a rifle. The Appellant's offence was well up the scale of those created by s.36(1). 

179I take a somewhat similar view in respect of the sentence of six months' imprisonment imposed for the offence of not keeping this rifle safely. Given that the sentence for this offence was entirely concurrent with part of the terms imposed for possessing and selling that unregistered rifle, it is unnecessary that I remark further on this six months sentence.

180More must be said however in relation to the sentence of two-and-a-half years, including a non-parole period of 12 months for possessing a slingshot. ""Prohibited weapons"" for the possession of which a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment is prescribed (and was when the Act was introduced in 1998) include military style weapons such as bombs, IEDs, grenades, rockets, missiles, mines and flame throwers - weapons vastly more dangerous, or at least with a much greater capacity to kill or injure, than the non-military prohibited weapons such as flick knives, star knives, crossbows, cat-o-nine-tails, Taser guns, extendable batons, knuckle dusters and slingshots. 

181I doubt if it is possible to find a feature common to all of the weapons in the non-military category other than their capacity to assist in the infliction of serious injury although a feature of many is the ease with which they can be concealed. Thus a flick knife would not seem inherently more dangerous than many other knives and an extendable baton not more dangerous than a non-extendable baton, baseball bat or medium sized jemmy. Flick knives and extendable batons are however much more easily concealed. 

182Ease of concealment is probably a feature of a slingshot but not of a crossbow. On the other hand, the latter weapon has a substantially greater prospect of resulting in a fatal wound than does the former, both because of its accuracy and the nature of its projectile.

183So far as I am aware there are no statistics as to the use or abuse of weapons in the prohibited weapons category or the extent to which they are used in the furtherance of other criminal activities. Certainly my experience on the bench has included a number of cases where flick knives and knuckle-dusters have been employed but with the exception of that referred to by her Honour, I have not heard of anywhere crossbows or slingshots have been. It is also of significance that the nature of slingshots (and cross-bows) is such that it is impossible to predicate that their possession or use is for the purposes of injuring people.

184In the result any conclusion as to where in the scale of prohibited weapons, slingshots and cross-bows fall, other than that they fall a long way below military weapons, must to a degree be a matter of impression. The wide variety of weapons also makes difficult any determination of what is an offence answering the description of that charged that is in the middle range of objective seriousness

185I do not deny the possibility that slingshots, particularly when used to fire a ball bearing could be fatal. However, it seems to me that they are very unlikely to be so, at least to anything larger than a bird. When one adds back the 25% discount her Honour applied, the sentence of two-and-a-half years imposed for the offence of possession of the slingshot represents a starting point of three years and four months - about one quarter of that provided for the possession of military style weapons to which reference has been made. I of course accept that the severity of sentences of imprisonment are not simply proportional to their length - see R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2; (2000) 111 A Crim R 152 - but three years and four months does not seem to me to adequately reflect the difference in the character of the weapons. The sentence of two-and-a-half years for possession of the slingshot was manifestly excessive. 

186In my view an appropriate sentence, if it were to include periods of non-parole and when the Applicant will be eligible for parole, would be one of 12 months. Divided in the usual proportions this would result in a non-parole period of nine months but given the other sentences imposed and to be imposed for this offence, I would simply make that nine months period a fixed term. 

187Falling as they do within the terms of s.23A(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, the sale of the slingshot and crossbow on 22 December and 31 January raise different issues. That section itself provides maximum penalties which differ for military and non-military weapons. The sale of non-military weapons attracts a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment and it is against that standard, shorn of the impact of military weapons, that the Appellant's offences involving the sale of these weapons must be judged.

188No doubt reflected in the penalty prescribed is the fact that after a sale the Appellant would have no control over the use to which the slingshot and crossbow would be put. However, as I have indicated, the nature of both is such that it is impossible to predicate that their possession or use is for the purposes of injuring people. Indeed, the fact that there are many other more convenient weapons available to those who, with a view to causing injury or death, are disposed to breach the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 or the Firearms Act 1996, argues against the likelihood of such use.

189In the result, for that offence of selling the crossbow, I would impose a sentence of imprisonment for a total of two-and-a-half years. For the sale of the slingshot, an appropriate sentence, if it were to include periods of non-parole and when the Applicant will be eligible for parole, would be one of one-and-a-half years. 

190As her Honour recognised, the number of offences meant that some degree of accumulation of sentences was required although the principle of totality led to the conclusion that there should also be a degree of concurrency. There was no challenge to her Honour's finding of special circumstances and certainly the accumulation of sentences inspires such a finding.

191As has been indicated, there is no occasion for this Court to interfere with the sentences of:

""A fixed term of 6 months imprisonment commencing on 29 January 2013, for the offence of not taking all reasonable precautions to keep a firearm safely, the subject of CAN H4399256/004 and

A fixed term of 18 months imprisonment commencing on 29 January 2013. for the offences of possessing and selling an unregistered firearm, the subject of CANs H4399256/003 and H4399256/006.""

192As has been said, the convictions and sentences imposed for Counts 1 to 4 on the indictment should be quashed. So must the sentence for possessing a slingshot, the subject of CAN H4399256/002. For that offence a sentence of a fixed term of nine months commencing on 29 April 2013 should be substituted.

193The Appellant should also be convicted and sentenced as follows:

""For the offence of, on 22 December 2010, selling a prohibited weapon, viz a slingshot, imprisonment for a fixed term of 14 months commencing on 29 July 2013, and

For the offence of, on 31 January 2011, selling a prohibited weapon, viz. a crossbow, imprisonment for a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 29 January 2014, together with a further term of 18 months commencing on 29 January 2015.""

194The departure in that last paragraph from the common 75:25 relativity is due to the accumulation of sentences and English DCJ's finding of special circumstances.

195The effective term of imprisonment will thus be one of imprisonment for fixed or non-parole terms totalling two years commencing on 29 January 2013, together with a further term of 18 months commencing on 29 January 2015.

196I propose the following orders:

(a) Grant leave to the Appellant to amend his Notice of Appeal by adding the further grounds set forth in [128] above.

(b) Allow the appeal against conviction.

(c) Quash the convictions and sentences imposed for Counts 1 to 4 on the indictment dated 17 September 2012.

(d) Convict the Appellant of a charge that on 22 December 2010 he did sell a prohibited weapon, viz. a slingshot.

(e) Convict the Appellant of a charge that on 31 January 2011 he did sell a prohibited weapon, viz. a ""Jaguar"" brand crossbow.

(f) Grant leave to appeal against sentence.

(g) Allow the appeal against sentence.

(h) Quash the sentence for possessing a slingshot, the subject of CAN H4399256/002. 

(i) In respect of the offence of possessing a slingshot, the subject of CAN H4399256/002, sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for a fixed term of nine months commencing on 29 April 2013.

(j) In respect of the offence of, on 22 December 2010 selling a prohibited weapon, viz. a slingshot, sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 14 months commencing on 29 July 2013.

(k) In respect of the offence of, on 31 January 2011, selling a prohibited weapon, viz. a crossbow, sentence the Appellant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 29 January 2014, together with a further term of 18 months commencing on 29 January 2015.

(l) Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Appellant shall become eligible for parole, 29 January 2015.

		23 April 2014",2014-04-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763772,CB v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 134,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY P: I agree with the reasons of Barrett JA and his Honour's proposed orders and with the additional reasons of Emmett JA. 

2BARRETT JA: These proceedings arise from a decision of a judge of the Common Law Division (Adamson J) who, on 23 May 2013, dismissed an appeal from a decision of Blewitt LCM, sitting in the Children's Court of New South Wales at Nowra. The magistrate had held that the present applicant was guilty of an offence under s 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Section 195(1) is in these terms:

""A person who intentionally or recklessly destroys or damages property belonging to another or to that person and another is liable:
(a) to imprisonment for 5 years, or
(b) if the destruction or damage is caused by means of fire or explosives, to imprisonment for 10 years.""

3The orders made by Adamson J were made pursuant to s 55 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). Section 55 is within Part 5 of the Act. Appeals to this Court from orders of the Supreme Court made on appeal under Part 5 require leave to appeal: Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 101(2)(h). 

4The applicant's application for leave to appeal and the appeal itself were heard concurrently. In addition and for reasons to be mentioned presently, an application under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act in respect of the Children's Court decision was made orally before this Court.

The facts

5The facts as found by the magistrate came very substantially from admissions made by the applicant when interviewed by police in the presence of his parents.

6At about 4.00pm on 29 March 2012, the applicant, who was then 14 years old, went with a friend to an unoccupied house at Sanctuary Point. The house was an investment property or holiday house that was in the process of being renovated by its owner at weekends. Some of the windows were boarded up but one could be opened from the outside. The applicant and his companion entered the house through that window without permission.

7Once inside, they went to an upper storey where the applicant smoked a cigarette. While sitting on a couch after his companion had gone downstairs, the applicant played with the companion's cigarette lighter and was ""singeing the couch"" - which, it appears, involved applying the flame of the lighter to either a fringe forming part of the couch's cover or threads where the fabric of the cover had frayed or been torn. The couch cushion contained foam which caught fire. The applicant attempted to extinguish the fire and called to his companion for help. They were unable to put the fire out and were forced to leave the premises when the smoke became overpowering. The house was destroyed. 

8Police apprehended the applicant and his companion later the same day. They were interviewed separately. The applicant gave a full account of events. Police accepted that he was truthful and remorseful.

The Children's Court proceedings 

9The applicant (as defendant) appeared before the Children's Court on 20 September 2012 in response to a court attendance notice charging two offences. The first was an offence under the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 (NSW). The second was expressed in these terms:

""Crimes Act 1900, Section 195(1)(b)
Intentionally or recklessly damage property by fire/explosive between 4.00 pm and 4.15 pm on 29/03/2012 at Sanctuary Point. did intentionally or recklessly destroy by means of fire certain property, to wit, A house at [address] Sanctuary Point the property of [name].""

10The applicant pleaded guilty to the first charge and not guilty to the second. There were two issues: first, an issue of doli incapax (and the question whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knew that what he was doing was wrong); and, second, whether the applicant recklessly destroyed the house. The magistrate found against the applicant on both issues. Only the second is of present relevance.

11The applicant's solicitor submitted before the Children's Court that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt, as a necessary element of the offence, that the accused foresaw the possibility that the house would be destroyed by fire. Reliance was placed on the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93; 81 NSWLR 119. That case was concerned with s 35(2) of the Crimes Act which, at the relevant time, provided that a person who recklessly caused grievous bodily harm was guilty of an offence. Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) held (at [82]), with the concurrence of James J, that a necessary element of the offence was that the accused should have foreseen that his conduct would cause grievous bodily harm and not just ""some physical injury"". The applicant relied on this analysis in support of the proposition that proof of a charge that encompasses a particular consequence entails proof of that very consequence and not just some general class of consequences of which the particular consequence forms part. 

12The prosecution submitted that it had only to prove that the accused foresaw that the particular kind of harm that occurred may occur and not the extent to which that harm occurred. In other words, the accused only had to foresee that his actions may lead to some property being destroyed by fire but not that his actions may lead to the destruction of the house.

13No authority was given for the proposition that the reasoning in Blackwell v R applied beyond the particular provision with which that case was concerned, although the view that it did received some support from the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book. The magistrate preferred the submissions of the prosecution and held:

""In my view there is no requirement in s 195 of the Crimes Act, nor in the definition contained in the Act, that it is necessary for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused foresaw the possibility of the house burning down. That being the case, the test is, as it has existed since Coleman [(1990) 19 NSWLR 467], that the accused had the realisation that the particular kind of harm in fact occasioned might occur, but not necessarily the degree to which that damage occurred.

So I am satisfied having regard to the admissions contained in the record of interview that the act of setting fire to the lounge was a deliberate act, it was not an accident. In my view the act of setting fire to that lounge and its subsequent spreading was a reckless act. ACCORDINGLY I FIND THAT THE OFFENCE HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.""

The appeal to the Supreme Court

14Upon his appeal to the Supreme Court, the applicant sought an order that the finding of guilt be set aside pursuant to s 55 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. 

15There were six grounds of appeal:

""(1) The Magistrate misconceived the elements of the offence under s 195 Crimes Act 1900;

(2) The Magistrate failed to give adequate reasons for his conclusion that the offence was proved beyond reasonable doubt;

(3) The Magistrate erred in finding that the [appellant] acted deliberately in setting fire to a lounge inside the premises;

(4) The Magistrate failed to give adequate reasons for his finding that the [appellant] acted deliberately in setting fire to a lounge inside the premises;

(5) The Magistrate erred in conflating the question of prima facie case with proof beyond reasonable doubt;

(6) The Magistrate erred in finding the offence proved beyond reasonable doubt.""

16Adamson J held that an appeal lay of right for grounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 under s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, and granted leave to appeal in respect of grounds 3 and 6 pursuant s 53. Her Honour also stated, albeit obliquely, that s 55 of the Act governed how a court may determine an appeal against a conviction. Section 55 is relevantly as follows:

""Determination of appeals:
(1) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against conviction:
(a) by setting aside the conviction, or
(b) by setting aside the conviction and remitting the matter to the Local Court sitting at the place at which the original Local Court proceedings were held for redetermination in accordance with the Supreme Court's directions, or
(c) by dismissing the appeal.""

17In relation to the grounds of appeal, her Honour found that the magistrate properly formulated the elements of the offence under s 195 of the Crimes Act (Ground 1); gave adequate reasons for his conclusion that the offence was proved beyond reasonable doubt (Ground 2); gave adequate reasons for his finding that the appellant deliberately set fire to the couch (Grounds 3 and 4); and correctly found that the offence was proved beyond reasonable doubt (Grounds 5 and 6). The primary judge ordered that the appeal be dismissed. 

The appeal to this Court 

18The applicant seeks to appeal on the following grounds:

1. That the primary judge erred in finding that the prosecution only had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the requisite mental element for the offence with which the applicant was charged under s 195 of the Crimes Act was that he foresaw the possibility that his actions might lead to property being destroyed, rather than that he had the foresight that his actions might lead to the house being destroyed;

2. That the primary judge erred in finding that the magistrate's reasons were adequate for his conclusion that the offence was made out; and,

3. That the primary judge erred in finding that the trial judge did not conflate the tests for whether there is a prima facie case and the test for whether the prosecution has proved its case. 

The judge's decision on the mental element (Ground 1)

19The first ground of appeal concerns the mental element of the offence charged.

20The applicant submitted before the primary judge that the magistrate was in error in deciding that it was sufficient that the accused person realise that the particular kind of harm in fact occasioned might occur, but not necessarily the degree to which that damage occurred. He contended that the prosecution had to prove that the accused person foresaw the possibility that his actions might lead to the destruction alleged - in the instant case, that applying a flame to the threads on the cover of the couch might lead to the destruction of the house building. Her Honour quoted the following passage from the written submissions:

""In this case, the 'particular kind of harm' alleged in the charge was the destruction of the house. Notwithstanding this, the Magistrate found that it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove...that the accused foresaw the possibility of the house burning down. This approach, it is submitted, involved an error of law. The Magistrate applied a wrong test."" [Emphasis in original]


21The submission of the respondent before the primary judge was that the magistrate was correct to conclude that there was no requirement, either in s 195 of the Crimes Act or in s 4A (which says that the element of recklessness, where required, may also be established by proof of intention or knowledge), that the prosecution prove beyond reasonable doubt that the plaintiff foresaw the possibility of the house burning down. It was sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the plaintiff foresaw the possibility of some destruction of property. This was because the prosecution had to prove the charge, but not the particulars of the charge; and it was not essential for proof of the charge that foresight of the possibility of the house burning down be proved, since the charge would be made out by proof of foresight of the possibility of damage to the couch.

22As the primary judge correctly observed, the question of the mental element required for an offence under s 195(1)(b) is a matter of statutory construction. Her Honour then turned to decided cases, noting the submission of counsel for the respondent that the magistrate's decision was consistent with Blackwell v R (above) and that R v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467 also needed to be considered. She then proceeded to ""summarise the proposition for which each stands"".

23Blackwell v R, her Honour said, had been decided by reference to a statutory provision concerning the meaning of ""maliciously"" since replaced which said that an act ""done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, . . . or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and of every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient in the crime"". The trial judge had directed the jury on the mental element required for the alternative charge or malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm in the following terms:

""Now you will see I have defined maliciously at the bottom of the page for you. It means intending to cause some physical injury, that is, the Crown must satisfy you that at the time [the appellant] inflicted grievous bodily harm to [Mr Ward] he did so intending to cause some physical injury... At law in the context of this particular charge maliciously means doing an act intending to cause some physical injury and without lawful cause or excuse.""

24Her Honour noted that, when the matter reached the Court of Criminal Appeal, there was a unanimous holding that, where the mental element of an offence is recklessness, the Crown must establish foresight of the possibility of the relevant consequence; and, since the relevant consequence for the alternative offence was grievous bodily harm, the direction was erroneous since it referred only to ""some physical injury"". Because the offence involved ""recklessly causing grievous bodily harm"", the mental element required was foresight of the possibility of grievous bodily harm. This was made clear in the following parts of Beazley JA's judgment:

""[78] . . . Accordingly, in this case, the jury should have been directed in terms that if the appellant was to be found guilty on the alternative count, they had to be satisfied that he realised that by thrusting the glass into Mr Ward's face, it was possible that grievous bodily harm, that is really serious injury, would be inflicted and yet went ahead and acted. . . 

[82] . . . Relevantly for present purposes, the statute provides for an offence of ""recklessly [causing] grievous bodily harm"". There is no definitional construct within the terms of the provision which governs its meaning. There is a requirement of recklessness, which I have addressed. That is, there must be a foresight of the possibility of something. The recklessness must cause something. That which it must cause is grievous bodily harm. In my opinion, there is no basis upon which that term can be read down to mean 'some physical injury'.""

25Against that background, the primary judge said (at [27)]:

""When one applies the construction authorised by Blackwell to the proscription in s 195(1)(b) against reckless damage or destruction of property belonging to another, the foresight of the possibility caused by the recklessness must be, in my view, damage to, or destruction of property, since they are the consequences referred to in the statute.""

26The primary judge then turned to R v Coleman (above), where the accused had been charged with malicious infliction of actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. The issue for determination was whether it was sufficient that the accused recognise the possibility that injury might result, or whether it was necessary that the accused recognise the probability that actual bodily harm would result. The Court of Criminal Appeal held as follows in relation to the now superseded statutory provision concerning ""maliciously"" to which reference has been made: 

""At the time of that decision [R v Crabbe (1985) 156 CLR 464], it was also generally accepted law in Australia that, in statutory offences other than murder, the degree of recklessness required in order to establish that an act was done maliciously was a realisation on the part of the accused that the particular kind of harm in fact done (that is, some physical harm - but not necessarily the degree of harm in fact so done) might be inflicted (that is, may possibly be inflicted) yet he went ahead and acted.""

The offence charged

27Submissions in this Court paid attention to the construction of the description of the statutory offence charged in the court attendance notice. That description is set out at [9] above. It consists of two parts, as follows:





First part:

""Crimes Act 1900, Section 195(1)(b)
Intentionally or recklessly damage property by fire/explosive.""





Second part:

""between 4.00 pm and 4.15 pm on 29/03/2012 at Sanctuary Point, did intentionally or recklessly destroy by means of fire certain property, to wit, A house at [address] Sanctuary Point the property of [name].""

28It was common ground before the primary judge that the charge was contained in the first part of the description and that the second part set out particulars of the offence charged. There was debate as to whether the element consisting of destruction of the house was an essential or an inessential fact or particular. 

29There is, in my opinion, no need to determine that matter. The description in the court attendance notice was inelegantly composed. But the meaning and intention were clear. The first part, whatever its technical status, served a merely introductory purpose. It identified the statutory provision under which the charge was brought and gave a short label to it. It was the second part that served the indispensable purpose identified by Evatt J in Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77; 59 CLR 467 at 497-8:

""It is an essential part of the concept of justice in criminal cases that not a single piece of evidence should be admitted against a defendant unless he has a right to resist its reception upon the ground of irrelevance, whereupon the court has both the right and the duty to rule upon such an objection. These fundamental rights cannot be exercised if, through a failure or refusal to specify or particularize the offence charged, neither the court nor the defendant (nor perhaps the prosecutor) is as yet aware of the offence intended to be charged. Indeed the matter arises at an even earlier stage. The defendant cannot plead unless he knows what is the precise charge being preferred against him. If he so chooses, a defendant has a right to plead guilty, and therefore to know what it is he is being called upon to answer."" 


30In this case, the accused was called upon to answer the second part of the description. He was not called upon to answer the proposition that he intentionally damaged the couch by fire or that he recklessly damaged furniture in some other room by fire. Nor had he to prepare himself to meet an allegation that he had damaged anything by explosives. All of those were possibilities comprehended by the first part of the description, read in conjunction with the section of the Act to which it referred; and that first part (which referred to damaging only) did not, in terms, comprehend what was put against the applicant in the second part, namely, that he destroyed something.

31Having regard to s 11 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), the first part was ""sufficient in law"" as a description of the offence. That section is as follows:

""The description of any offence in the words of an Act or statutory rule or other document creating the offence, or in similar words, is sufficient in law.""

32In Kirk v Industrial Relations Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531, French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ noted (at [26]) that it had been held in Smith v Moody [1903] 1 KB 56 that such a statutory provision did not dispense with the common law rule ""that fair information and reasonable particularity as to the nature of the offence must be given in indictments"" (per Lord Alverstone CJ at 60). The members of the High Court also noted that, in Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 153, Jordan CJ doubted that earlier authorities such as Smith v Moody should be regarded as binding and was of the view that the object of the rule could be secured only by the requirement of particulars on the face of the information. The joint judgment continued (at [29]):

""Nevertheless, in Johnson v Miller, Dixon J appears to have applied the common law rule and to have held that a statutory provision like that made by s 11 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 'relates only to the nature of the offence and does not dispense with the necessity of specifying the time, place and manner of the defendant's acts or omissions'.""

33The applicant, in deciding how to respond to the charge brought against him, was fully justified in regarding the first part of the description in the court attendance notice as relating ""only to the nature of the offence"" and the second part as stating the allegation to be met. He was therefore justified in thinking that the prosecution had discarded possibilities involving damage as distinct from destruction. With particular property identified in the second part of the description and the allegation in that part confined to destruction (as distinct from damage), the prosecution had to establish two things to the requisite standard: first, that the applicant destroyed the identified property (the house); and, second, that the destruction of that property by the applicant was accompanied by a relevant mental element (intention or recklessness). The case that the prosecution in fact pursued, as to the mental element, was a case of recklessness, not intention. There was no allegation that the applicant intentionally destroyed the house. The allegation was that he recklessly destroyed the house. 

34The was discussion in the course of argument in this Court as to the meaning of:

""A house at [address] Sanctuary Point the property of [name].""

35A possibility canvassed is that this description included not only the building but also chattels within that building, so that the allegation was to be understood as involving destruction of the building and each and every thing within it. On that basis, the ""house"" included the couch and, arguably, the threads on the cover of the couch. I do not accept that construction. The description in the court attendance notice put the applicant on notice that he had to deal with the proposition that he had, with the relevant mental element, destroyed the particular ""house"", not some other item of property (potentially of trifling value) within the house or elsewhere. The reference was to the building and to destruction of the building.

Ground 1 - assessment 

36The issue raised by the first ground of appeal is whether, with recklessness rather than intention identified as the relevant mental element, the prosecution had to prove that the applicant realised that, by his acting as he did, it was possible that the house would be destroyed or whether it was sufficient to prove that he realised the possibility that some property or other would be either destroyed or damaged.

37Numerous offences created by the Crimes Act have recklessness as an ingredient. In many cases, recklessness is an alternative to intention, in that an offence is committed if specified conduct is engaged in either intentionally or recklessly. This is the scheme adopted in Part 4AD (which includes s 195(1)) inserted by the Crimes (Criminal Destruction and Damage) Amendment Act 1987 (NSW). In such cases, recklessness is established by proof that the accused realised that the particular type of harm constituting the offence (but not necessarily harm of the severity of that in fact caused) may possibly be inflicted, yet the accused went ahead and acted. This formulation has been generally favoured in this State since R v Coleman (above).

38The primary judge's view, which corresponded with that of the magistrate, was that the necessary foresight in the case of a charge under s 195(1) involving recklessness rather than intention is that of ""damage to, or destruction of, property, since they are the consequences referred to in the statute""; and that the only necessary finding in relation to the property the subject of the foresight is that, as specified in the statute, it be property ""belonging to another"".

39The contention of the applicant in this Court was that, leaving to one side as irrelevant any issue of intention, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the applicant had recklessly destroyed the house and that foresight of the possibility of destruction of the house itself comprised the element of the charged offence comprehended by the word ""recklessly"".

40As the primary judge recognised, the resolution of this matter involves the construction of the statute. The statutory offence is, in one sense, multi-faceted. As a matter of words, s 195(1) provides that an act capable of amounting to contravention occurs if a person destroys property or damages property. When the mental element is added, there are four proscriptions: intentionally destroying, recklessly destroying, intentionally damaging and recklessly damaging; and the number rises to eight in a s 195(1)(b) case, four involving fire and four involving explosives.

41The implicit premise is that a given course of conduct may cause either damage or destruction. The latter, obviously enough, is at the most serious point on a scale which, at its lower end, involves slight or trivial damage. Destruction and damage are not posited as distinct effects or results. Rather, each is an aspect of a single statutory specification, with destruction recognised as the absolute form of damage. The act relevant to the statutory offence is committed regardless of the point on the spectrum of seriousness occupied by the harm that that act actually causes. There is not an offence of damaging and an offence of destroying. The offence is one of causing harm to property to any degree from the slightest damage to destruction. It thus encompasses a single form of conduct of varying severity, not two forms of conduct (being, first, damage standing anywhere in the range from trivial to virtual destruction and, second, destruction as an absolute).

42That being so, the decision in Chen v R [2013] NSWCCA 116 is instructive as to the mental element of recklessness. The accused in that case was charged with an offence under s 35(3) of the Crimes Act:

""A person who, in the company of another person or persons, recklessly wounds any person is guilty of an offence.""

43It was held that the reasoning in Blackwell v R was irrelevant to the issue of recklessness in relation to this offence. The offence is defined in terms of an act of wounding. A provision dealing with that act has regard to the inflicting of a wound of any degree of seriousness, from ""a small cut"" to ""a gaping one"", to quote Button J (at [51]). Grievous bodily harm, by contrast, consists of harm of a particular degree of seriousness. An act occasioning bodily harm falling short of that degree of seriousness is not comprehended by the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm and, as was held in Blackwell v R, even when harm of that degree is inflicted, recklessness is not established if the consequence foreseen was harm of a lesser degree. 

44Recklessness in relation to an offence involving a result of a particular quality requires foresight of a result of that quality, not some other result. If the result is wounding, the offence entailing recklessness is committed by a person who inflicts a gaping wound even if the person's foresight extended to a small cut only. Both the act and the foresight entail wounding. If the result is grievous bodily harm, the offence entailing recklessness is committed by a person who deprives the victim of both eyes even if the person's foresight extended to deprivation of only one. Both the act and the foresight involve grievous bodily harm, it being obvious that some instances of grievous bodily harm are more extreme and more serious than others, just as some wounds are more extreme and more serious than others.

45In the case of an offence under s 195(1) of the Crimes Act, the result that the accused's acts must produce in order to sustain conviction is harm to property at any point on the scale of seriousness from minor damage to destruction. The foresight that must be proved to establish recklessness is therefore foresight of harm to property to any degree from minor damage to destruction. If the result of the accused's acts is slight or moderate damage, recklessness will be established if the proved foresight was of destruction; and likewise if the result is destruction, recklessness will be established if the proved foresight was of slight or moderate damage.

46A charge under s 195(1) is necessarily framed in terms of particulars alleging damage to or destruction of specified property. But the necessary foresight, where recklessness is alleged, is not confined to foresight of damage to or destruction of that specific property. It is sufficient that the foresight be in relation to property more generally. Thus, someone who lights a fire foreseeing that a particular house might thereby be damaged or destroyed does not escape conviction because the wind changes and the fire destroys a motor vehicle parked in the adjacent street. A conviction in relation to the vehicle will be supported by the foresight of damage to or destruction of the house. Furthermore, the foresight need not comprehend any particular item of property. A person who, as an act of spite, throws a bomb into a factory building after all the workers have gone home has foresight of damage to or destruction of a large range of property within the building much of which may be unknown to the person. That foresight would be sufficient to support a finding of recklessness where the particulars of charge referred to destruction of, say, a particular machine in fact destroyed by the blast; and this would be so whether or not the perpetrator had foresight that that machine might be affected or even knew that such a machine was on the premises. 

47The primary judge and the magistrate were correct in their conclusion that acts causing destruction of the house accompanied by foresight of harm to any property, whether damage or destruction, was sufficient; and that the prosecution was not required to prove foresight of destruction of the house alone.

The judge's decision on adequacy of reasons (Ground 2)

48As the primary judge recognised (at [50]), the giving of reasons is central to the judicial function: Wainohu v New South Wales [2011] HCA 24; 243 CLR 181 at [54]-[58] per French CJ and Kiefel J. Her Honour quoted a passage in the judgment of Meagher JA in Beale v Government Insurance Office (NSW) (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 (at 442):

""A failure to provide sufficient reasons can and often does lead to a real sense of grievance that a party does not know or understand why the decision was made: Re Poyser and Mills' Arbitration [1964] 2 QB 467 at 478. This Court has previously accepted the proposition that a judge is bound to expose his reasoning in sufficient detail to enable a losing party to understand why they lost ... One reason is obvious: if decisions cannot be understood, a feeling of injustice can arise ...""

49Reference was also made to the need to make allowance for the pressures under which magistrates are required to make decisions and also for judgments which are given ex tempore: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402 at [15]-[18].

50The judge referred to the magistrate's opinion, based on the police interview, that the prosecution was not able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant foresaw the possibility of the house burning down. Her Honour quoted the following part of the magistrate's reasons for decision:

""In particular, reference was made to the answers contained in the record of interview at question 117 where, I am paraphrasing, that the accused said to the police that 'We just thought that the couch was going to burn out and the flyscreen.' Answer to question 128, he did not think that the whole house would catch fire. Answer to question 148, he thought that he was just going to singe the couch, as well as answers to questions 151 and 159 which demonstrate that the accused was not aware of the consequences.
If the position is that the prosecution must establish that the accused must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused foresaw the possibility of the house burning down, I think the answers that I have just referred to in the record of interview would place the prosecution in some jeopardy.""

51Thereafter, having said that it was sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the plaintiff realised that damage to property might occur and that the prosecution did not have to prove that the plaintiff realised that his act of singeing the couch might cause the house to burn down, the magistrate said:

""So I am satisfied having regard to the admissions contained in the record of interview that the act of setting fire to the lounge was a deliberate act, it was not an accident. In my view that act of setting fire to the lounge and its subsequent spreading to beyond the lounge was a reckless act.""

52The primary judge was of the opinion that the magistrate's reasons were sufficient to address the principal arguments raised by the plaintiff and were ample to inform him why he was convicted. Her Honour observed that the reasons articulated the opposing arguments on the construction issue, gave reasons for preferring the construction for which the prosecution contended and sufficiently identified the evidence of the plaintiff's admissions which resulted in his Honour being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the plaintiff's guilt. Accordingly, the primary judge did not accept the submission that the magistrate had failed to give adequate reasons. 

Ground 2 - assessment 

53The applicant says that the primary judge failed to deal adequately with several shortcomings in the magistrate's decision, specifically, that there was no articulation of the reasoning employed in concluding that the act of setting fire to the couch was deliberate and no identification of the admissions relied on in that respect; that there was no explanation of how the magistrate had concluded that ""spreading beyond the lounge was a reckless act""; and that there was no articulation of the basis for concluding that there was no reasonable doubt about the applicant's guilt.

54As submissions made on the respondent's behalf recognise, the applicant's complaint depends on some relevant distinction between ""singeing the couch"" (something the applicant admitted he did) and setting it on fire. There is, in reality, no relevant distinction. The applicant admitted that he deliberately applied a flame to part of the couch, being the threads or fringe that he was ""singeing"". That was sufficient to support a finding of deliberate setting fire to the couch, in the same way as a finding of deliberately applying a flame to the very tip if one corner of a sheet of paper supports a finding of deliberately setting fire to the sheet of paper. The primary judge was correct to describe the magistrate's reasons, in that respect, as ""sufficiently clear"".

55As to the basis for the conclusion that ""spreading beyond the lounge was a reckless act"", the magistrate's discussion of the recklessness concept made it clear that he appreciated the issue to be whether there was foresight of damage beyond that immediately inflicted by the igniting of fibres of the fringe; and the reference to the admissions as a basis for the finding entailed explicit reliance on the following part of the police interview: 

""Q: So yes, I guess, is it fair to say that yes, you certainly didn't, did you have any intention of lighting the couch.
A: No. Not completely on fire. No.

Q: So what was your intention, just to ---
A: Just to singe it.

Q: O.K. I guess, even as little things like that, do you appreciate that that's not the right thing to do?
A: Yes. Definitely.

Q: O.K. Why, I guess, just to ask. You know why did you?
A: 'Cause it could have endangered people around us. Houses, people animals.

Q: But if, if, if you did know it was the wrong thing to do, why did you, you know, why would you do it?
A: 'Cause I didn't think it was gunna set the whole couch on fire.""

56The applicant's foresight that his actions might have ""endangered"" nearby houses, people and animals was clearly acknowledged. That foresight included the possibility of damage to property, even though the applicant did not ""think"" that he was going to set the whole couch on fire. In addition, there was a clear acknowledgement of foresight that the couch would be burnt to some extent (and thereby at least damaged), that being the import of the applicant's statement that he did not think he was going to set ""the whole couch"" on fire. The applicant realised that the particular type of harm constituting the offence (damage to property, to any degree up to and including destruction) may possibly be inflicted - even would be inflicted - yet went ahead and acted. The magistrate's articulation of reasons made it clear that it was because of the admissions in the record of interview that he regarded the relevant matters, including recklessness, as proved beyond reasonable doubt.

57The magistrate was correct in this respect and the primary judge correctly held that there was no error.

The ""no case to answer"" issue (Ground 3)

58The applicant complained before the primary judge that the magistrate had failed to distinguish between proof of a prima facie case and proof beyond reasonable doubt. The primary judge did not accept that proposition. She referred to the course of the hearing. The police brief (including the record of interview) was admitted into evidence by consent and the hearing proceeded by way of oral submissions. No witnesses were called. The applicant's solicitor made a ""no case"" submission on the second charge, dealing with the doli incapax issue and the question whether the evidence was capable of establishing that the plaintiff intentionally or recklessly destroyed the house by fire.

59After referring to the core content of the magistrate's decision (set out at [13] above), the primary judge said that, while the magistrate did not expressly say that there was a case to answer, that conclusion was implicit in his finding as to the requisite mental element; and, because there was evidence on the basis of which it was open to the magistrate to find that the plaintiff foresaw at least that the couch might be damaged, the determination of the legal test of recklessness against the applicant meant that there was necessarily a case to answer.

60It was common ground before the primary judge that the applicant did not intend to call evidence if the no case submission was rejected and agreed that the magistrate could determine the matter on the papers. For that reason, her Honour said, it would have been futile for the magistrate to determine the no case submission and then ask the plaintiff whether he wished to go into evidence.

61The judge also observed that the applicant's submissions before the magistrate were directed to an interpretation and weighing of the evidence, something that would not have been germane to an assessment whether there was a case to answer but was central to the determination whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt; and the applicant's case was conducted on the basis that, if the magistrate decided that there was a case to answer, he would proceed to determine whether the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

62The primary judge's conclusion on this aspect (at [77]-[79]) was:

""I consider that the substance of what the Magistrate said and did was sufficient to indicate that his Honour distinguished between the requirements of a case to answer on the one hand and satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt on the other. That his Honour did so in a shorthand way is understandable in circumstances where there was no conflict in the evidence and the plaintiff had elected not to adduce evidence in his case. The only real matters in issue, apart from doli incapax, which is not the subject of appeal, were the mental element required and the effect of the plaintiff's admissions as to his thought processes.

Although the Magistrate did not, in his reasons, expressly deal with the two matters separately, his Honour did make clear in the final paragraph of the reasons that he was addressing the second question: whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. This followed a consideration of the elements of the offence together with the evidence probative of such elements. The Magistrate had earlier addressed the question of the mental element in respect of which there needed to be some evidence for there to be a case to answer.

The Magistrate did not in terms say 'I find there is no [sic; scil 'a'] case to answer'. However in light of the way the hearing was conducted and the submissions were made, the Magistrate must be taken to have found a case to answer since this was the only basis on which his Honour could have proceeded to determine the factual question whether the requisite mental element had been established beyond reasonable doubt.""

Ground 3 - assessment 

63The applicant maintains in this Court that the judge should have recognised that the magistrate in truth heard a ""no prima facie case"" submission and then, as it were, jumped to a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt and, in doing so, failed to distinguish between the capacity of the evidence, taken at its highest, to satisfy the court that the offence had been committed and the question whether the evidence had in truth made out the offence beyond reasonable doubt.

64It is true that the magistrate made no express finding that there was a case to answer. But, as the primary judge recognised, he implicitly embraced that proposition by dealing with the matter in the way that he did, that is, by surveying the whole of the evidence in a context where the issue of recklessness and the findings necessary for proof of that element had been exposed and then announcing the unambiguous conclusion stated at [13] above.

65There is no room to doubt that, as the primary judge found, the magistrate embarked on the process of deciding the issues relevant to the applicant's guilt, directed himself as to the legal test of recklessness and then made a determination of the pertinent factual matters beyond reasonable doubt. The course taken is clearly demonstrated by the transcript of the Children's Court hearing. There was no confusion with the process of deciding whether there was a case to answer.

Conclusion 

66The applicant has not made good any of the grounds on which he seeks to appeal from the decision of the primary judge.

67Because the issue concerning recklessness involves an important question of law, leave to appeal should be granted. But the appeal should be dismissed.

68I mentioned at the outset that the applicant had made an oral application under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act in respect of the Children's Court decision. This was prompted by the circumstance that, after the adjudication of the magistrate, the applicant was referred to a youth justice conference and entered into (and performed) a youth justice agreement, following which the charge under s 195(1) of the Crimes Act was dismissed on 4 July 2013 in accordance with provisions of the Young Offenders Act 1997 (NSW). That raised an issue of utility of the proceedings in this Court. It was noted, however, that the master bench sheet forming part of the record of the Children's Court at Nowra continued to contain an entry in respect of the s 195(1) charge: ""Proved following hearing (on papers)"". The s 69 application was made with a view to that entry being somehow dealt with by an order of this Court if the appeal were allowed. In view of what I have said about the outcome of the appeal, that possibility does not need to be pursued and the capacity of a s 69 order to produce the desired result does not need to be explored (see, however, LS v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2011] NSWSC 1016).

69Finally, I note the parties' agreement that there should be no order as to costs in this Court.

70I propose orders as follows:

1. Grant leave to appeal.

2. Direct that a notice of appeal in the form of the draft in the white folder be filed within seven days.

3. Dismiss the appeal.

4. No order as to costs.

71EMMETT JA: The applicant, an infant (CB), seeks leave to appeal to this Court from an order made by a Judge of the Common Law Division dismissing an appeal from a decision of the Children's Court. CB was convicted of an offence under s 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act). He appealed to the Supreme Court under ss 52 and 53 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (the Appeal Act). The primary judge ordered on 23 May 2013 that CB's appeal be dismissed. By summons dated 22 August 2013, CB has applied for leave to appeal under s 101(2)(h) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) (the Supreme Court Act) and Rule 51.10 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR). 

72Section 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act relevantly provides that a person who intentionally or recklessly destroys or damages property belonging to another, by means of fire, is liable to imprisonment for ten years. Property, as defined in s 4, includes every description of real and personal property. Under s 4A, if an element of an offence is recklessness, that element may also be established by proof of intention or knowledge. 

73At 4pm on 29 March 2012, CB, who was then aged nearly 15 years, and another youth (CS), climbed through the bathroom window of an unoccupied residence in Sanctuary Point, New South Wales. The residence was being renovated at the weekends by its owners. CB and CS went up to the third floor where they smoked cigarettes, which they lit with a lighter belonging to CS. CS went downstairs and CB used the lighter to singe frayed material on a couch. The couch was made of foam and caught fire. CS returned to the third floor to help CB in trying to extinguish the fire, but their efforts were unsuccessful. When the room filled with smoke, they left the residence, which then burnt down. 

74CB was subsequently charged with an offence under s 195(1)(b) in the following terms:

Intentionally or recklessly damage property by fire/explosive
between 4:00pm and 4:15pm on 29/03/2012 at Sanctuary Point, 
did intentionally or recklessly destroy by means of fire certain property, to wit, A house at ... Sanctuary Point, the property of ...

75The prosecution case consisted of the police brief, which included an electronically recorded interview of CB (the Interview Record) and statements by police officers. None of the makers of statements was cross-examined and no objection was taken to the Interview Record. At the close of the prosecution case, CB, through his solicitor, submitted that there was no case to answer. The solicitor indicated that CB would not go into evidence in any event. The magistrate sitting as the Children's Court stood the matter down in the list so that he could read the police brief. Later in the day, for reasons given ex tempore, his Honour found that ""the offence"" had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 

76The Children's Court magistrate indicated to the parties that he thought that it was appropriate to refer the matter to a youth justice conference since CB had no criminal record. The prosecution supported that course. 

77The prosecution then indicated to the Children's Court magistrate that the owners of the house wished to attend the conference and had asked the prosecution to ask the Court for compensation. The prosecutor indicated that the total repair bill was $166,000. Later, the magistrate said that, while he had been asked to consider the question of compensation, the Children's Court had only very limited power to order compensation and certainly nowhere near the amount sought by the owners. His Honour said that he would not make any order for the payment of compensation. His Honour then adjourned the proceedings to a date in November 2012, but excused CB from attending provided that he completed any outcome plan prepared as a result of the conference. 

78Following the decision of the Children's Court, CB was referred to a youth justice conference. He entered into, and subsequently performed, a youth justice agreement. The charge under s 195(1)(b) was then dismissed on 4 July 2013, in accordance with the provisions of the Young Offenders Act 1997 (NSW). 

79There was no suggestion that a different outcome would have been possible had the particulars of the charge asserted that CB did intentionally or recklessly destroy by means of fire certain property, to wit, a couch situated in a house at Sanctuary Point, rather than referring to intentionally or recklessly destroying by means of fire certain property, to wit, a house at Sanctuary Point. That is to say, there can be no suggestion that the treatment of CB was based on reckless destruction of the house, rather than reckless destruction of the couch. 

80In his amended summons instituting the appeal under the Appeal Act, CB sought an order setting aside ""the conviction (finding of guilt)"" made by the Children's Court. Alternatively, he sought an order setting aside ""the conviction (finding of guilt)"" made by the Children's Court and remitting the matter for redetermination in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court. 

81Before the primary judge, CB relied on six grounds. The primary judge rejected all of those grounds. The proposed grounds to be relied upon if leave to appeal to this Court is granted are as follows:
(1)The primary judge erred in finding that, in order to establish a charge that CB intentionally or recklessly destroyed a house by means of fire, it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove that CB foresaw the possibility that his actions might lead to the house being destroyed;
(2)The primary judge erred in finding that the Children's Court gave adequate reasons for the conclusion that the charge was made out;
(3)The primary judge erred in finding that the Children's Court did not err in failing to distinguish between proof of a prima facie case and proof beyond reasonable doubt.

82The respondent to these proceedings, the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP), opposes the grant of leave on the basis that the decision of the primary judge was the product of the application to the decision of the Children's Court of well-settled principles. A direction was given that the application for leave to appeal be heard concurrently with the appeal, assuming that leave were to be granted. 

Ground 1: The Necessary Mental Element

83In his reasons, the Children's Court magistrate considered that, if the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that CB foresaw the possibility of the house burning down, the answers contained in the Interview Record of CB would place the prosecution in some jeopardy. However, his Honour accepted the submission of the prosecution that that is not the test. His Honour held that there is no requirement in s 195, nor in the definitions contained in the Crimes Act, for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that CB foresaw the possibility of the house burning down. Rather, his Honour said, the test is that CB had the realisation that the particular kind of harm in fact occasioned might occur, but not necessarily the degree to which that damage occurred. Accordingly, his Honour was satisfied, having regard to the admissions contained in the Interview Record, that the act of setting fire to the lounge was ""a deliberate act"" and that the act of setting fire to the lounge, and its subsequent spreading beyond the lounge, was ""a reckless act"". Therefore, his Honour found that ""the offence"" had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. 

84CB contends that the requirements of procedural fairness did not permit the prosecution to depart from the particulars pleaded in the charge. The charge expressly alleged that CB either intentionally or recklessly destroyed the property, namely, the house, by means of fire. That was the issue on which CB contested the case in the Children's Court. It was on that basis, CB contends, the solicitor acting for CB must be taken to have made decisions as to how to run the case, for example, whether or not to go into evidence, and to have given advice to CB. Having regard to the specific way in which the charge was pleaded, and the way in which the respective cases of the prosecution and CB were run, the destruction of the house was an essential fact or particular. 

85As a general rule, in order to obtain a conviction, the Crown must establish the essential facts alleged in the Indictment. If the Crown fails to establish an inessential fact, or fails to establish a particular provided before the trial, that will not necessarily be fatal. On the other hand, in some circumstances, the requirements of procedural or substantive fairness may restrict the capacity of the prosecution to depart from particulars (see R v VHP (Court of Appeal (NSW), 7 July 1997, unrep)). 

86Section 175(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) relevantly provides that a Court Attendance Notice must describe the offence and briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence. Under s 11, the description of any offence in the words of an Act creating the offence, or in similar words, is sufficient in law. Under s 12, an indictable offence that may be dealt with summarily is taken to be sufficiently stated or described if it is stated or described by the use of a short expression that describes the offence in general terms. That provision applies to a statement or description of an offence in any Court Attendance Notice. 

87Clearly, in the light of those provisions, there are two requirements for an effective Court Attendance Notice. The first is to describe the offence. The Court Attendance Notice in the present case did that in the following terms:

Crimes Act 1900, Section 195(1)(b)
Intentionally or recklessly damage property by fire/explosive.

88The second requirement is that the Court Attendance Notice briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence. In the present case, that was done by the following:

between 4:00pm and 4:15pm on 29/03/2012 at Sanctuary Point, 
did intentionally or recklessly destroy by means of fire certain property, to wit, A house at ... Sanctuary Point, the property of ... .

89CB contends that the primary judge should have found that the charge brought against him required the prosecution to prove that he had intentionally or recklessly destroyed the house, since that is the allegation made by the prosecution. He says that the primary judge erred in concluding that it was sufficient for the prosecution to prove merely that he foresaw the possibility of some damage to any property whatsoever, no matter which property and no matter how minimal. 

90Where the mental element of an offence is recklessness, satisfying that element requires the prosecution to establish foresight of the possibility of a relevant consequence. The primary judge held that the reference to the relevant consequence is a reference to the physical consequences of the acts in question contemplated by the statutory provision (see Blackwell v The Queen [2001] NSWCCA 93; 81 NSWLR 119). The primary judge considered that the foresight of the possibility caused by the recklessness must be damage to, or destruction of, property, since they are the consequences referred to in s 195(1)(b). The property to which the foresight of the possibility of damage or destruction applies is described in s 195(1)(b) as ""property belonging to another"". All that was necessary, on that contention, is that CB be found guilty of having damaged or destroyed property of another. 

91I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the proposed reasons of Barrett JA. I agree, for the reasons given by his Honour, that the primary judge and the Children's Court made no error in concluding that acts causing destruction of the house, accompanied by foresight of harm to any property, whether damage or destruction, were sufficient and that it was not necessary to prove foresight on the part of CB on the destruction of the house alone. 

Ground 2: Adequacy of Reasons

92The primary judge rejected CB's contentions that the Children's Court had given inadequate reasons for being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of CB's guilt. Her Honour characterised the real issue in the case as being the mental element required and whether the prosecution had at least established foresight of the possibility of the couch being damaged beyond reasonable doubt. The Children's Court magistrate was satisfied that the act of setting fire to the lounge was a deliberate act and not an accident and that that act was a reckless act because CB foresaw the possibility that the couch might be damaged. Accordingly, his Honour found that the offence had been proved. 

93I also agree with Barrett JA, for the reasons given by his Honour, that the articulation of reasons by the Children's Court made it clear that it was because of the admissions in the Record of Interview that the relevant matters, including recklessness, were regarded as proved beyond reasonable doubt. The primary judge correctly held that there was no error in that regard. 

Ground 3: Distinction between proof of a prima facie case and proof beyond reasonable doubt

94The question whether the prosecution has established a prima facie case is a question of law, while the question of whether it has proved the commission of the offence beyond reasonable doubt is a question of fact. The two questions are separate and distinct. Keeping the two issues separate and distinct is more than a mere formality (DPP v Adam James Lee [2006] NSWSC 270 at [32]). 

95The prosecution's case before the Children's Court consisted of the police brief, which was admitted by consent. No witnesses were called. CB's solicitor then made a ""no case"" submission on the charge under s 195(1)(b). The submissions concerned two issues. The first was whether the prosecution had established that CB knew that what he was doing was wrong. The second was whether the evidence was capable of establishing that CB intentionally or recklessly destroyed the house by fire. The Children's Court magistrate concluded that foresight of the possibility of damage to property was sufficient, rather than, as was contended on behalf of CB, that it was necessary to establish foresight of the possibility of the house burning down. 

96Although the Children's Court did not expressly find that there was a case to answer, it was implicit in the magistrate's finding as to the requisite mental element that there was evidence that, if accepted, could establish that CB foresaw the possibility of damage to property. I agree with Barrett JA, for the reasons given by his Honour, that, as the primary judge found, the Children's Court embarked on a process of deciding issues relevant to CB's guilt, directed itself as to the legal test of recklessness and then made a determination of the relevant factual matters beyond reasonable doubt. CB's solicitor had indicated that he did not intend to call evidence if the ""no case"" submission was rejected and agreed that the Children's Court magistrate could determine the matter on the papers. It would therefore have been futile to determine the ""no case"" submission and then ask CB whether he wished to go into evidence. 

Conclusion

97There are reasonable arguments in support of the first proposed ground of appeal. In the circumstances, I agree with Barrett JA that leave to appeal should be granted. However, the appeal should be dismissed. The DPP does not ask for any order for costs.

6The principal complaint is that each of the sentences, and the combined sentence, were manifestly inadequate (ground 4 in respect of the Puckeridge sentence and ground 1 in respect of the Haesler sentence). 
7In respect of the Puckeridge sentence, the additional grounds are:
(1)Accumulating the two sentences by one year was erroneous (ground 1);
(2)Insufficient effect was given to the respondent's role (ground 2);
(3)It was erroneous to take into account the respondent's depressive condition and opium use in the absence of evidence of a temporal or causal link to the offending (ground 3).
8In respect of the Haesler sentence the additional grounds are:
(1)Failure to have sufficient regard to the Standard Non-Parole Period (SNPP) for the drug offences (ground 2); and
(2)The erroneous finding that depressive illness and opium use ought be taken into account in the commission of the offences in the absence of evidence of a causal or temporal link to the offending (ground 3).
The facts
Procedural matters: severance of the opium counts
9On 18 June 2013 the respondent entered a plea of not guilty to an indictment containing seven counts involving the importation, possession and supply of various border-controlled drugs. Counts 1-3 concerned opium. Counts 4-7 concerned morphine, heroin and methylamphetamine. Puckeridge A-DCJ granted the respondent's application to sever counts 4-7 from counts 1-3. 
10On 24 June 2013, the Crown presented a fresh indictment that contained only counts 1-3, the opium counts. By verdicts returned on 12 July 2013, the jury found the respondent guilty of counts 1 and 2.
The facts as established in the trial conducted by Puckeridge A-DCJ 
11In about July 2010 the respondent left Australia for Iran. After his return a month or two later, the first of seven shipments arrived in Sydney by air from Tehran, Iran. Each of the consignments was addressed to Ali Roshane (who did not exist) at an address in North Parramatta which was a similar address to one used by the respondent in 2001 and 2002. The first six containers were not examined by Australian Customs and Border Security (Customs). 
12In May 2011, the seventh consignment of goods arrived and was examined. Its contents were described as ""Carpet, bed sheet, samovar"". The consignment contained samovars (Persian tea urns) and rugs. Analysis of a brown substance concealed in the samovars revealed it to be opium. The net weight of the opium was 14,875.9 g. Unlike other drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, opium has no ""pure weight"". Section 314.4 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) defines a ""marketable quantity"" of opium to be an amount between 20g and 20 kgs.
13Telephone records showed calls between the phone number on the consignment notes for the seventh and a previous consignment and phone numbers of persons associated with the respondent.
14A search warrant executed on a locker at Rydalmere in a storage facility operated by Kennard's revealed six samovars, one of which contained opium, in the form of a brown substance, which had a net weight of 8,342.1 g (the subject of the second count). A set of electronic scales, a knife and small zip lock plastic bags were also found, together with a receipt associated with the respondent's wife. The respondent's fingerprints were found on various items within the locker.
15The storage locker also contained other drugs (methylamphetamine, heroin and morphine) the details of which will be set out below since the respondent was sentenced for offences relating to those drugs by Haesler DCJ.
16A search warrant was executed on the respondent's home at Bella Vista on 18 July 2011. One of the phones seized was linked to the consignment. A key which fitted the padlock on the storage locker at Rydalmere was also found.
17The total amount of cash in the respondent's possession was $348,350. This offence was on a schedule to be taken into account by Haesler DCJ pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) when sentencing the respondent for an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime. 
18The principal issue at the trial before Puckeridge A-DCJ was whether the respondent knew, or was reckless as to the fact, that the consignment contained opium. There was considerable evidence to establish the respondent's involvement in the consignment as well as closed circuit television (CCTV) footage of his accessing the storage facility on five occasions.
The respondent's case at trial
19The respondent denied knowledge of the consignment and the opium found at the storage unit and his home. He admitted using the storage unit but said he visited it only on the occasions recorded on CCTV and that it belonged to a friend. He denied having anything to do with the opening of an account with Kennard's Storage several years before.
The sentence hearing before Puckeridge A-DCJ
20The Crown read an affidavit of Detective Sergeant Stipnieks, whose evidence was not challenged. He opined that the combined street value of opium resin was $706,758 and its wholesale value was $471,200.
21At the sentence hearing, the respondent tendered:
(1)his statement in support of his application for a protection visa together with documents to establish that he suffered from depression in Iran;
(2)a document and a certified translation that stated that his brother was executed on 16 August 1984;
(3)a report of Becky Salter, family caseworker, which recorded the detrimental effect of the respondent's incarceration on his family; and
(4)a report dated 10 August 2013 of Dr Allnutt who saw the respondent on 30 July 2013 for the purposes of preparing a report for the sentence hearing.
22In his report Dr Allnutt concluded:Your client states that since he has been in Australia he had continued to have underlying depressive and anxiety symptoms and has continued to use opium until the time of his arrest thus manifesting both a Depressive Disorder and probable Opium Dependence Disorder both of which it appears were active at the material time of the alleged offending.
Your client denies the offending and thus it is not possible for me to provide any opinion on the nexus between of the relationship between any psychiatric disorder that he might be experiencing and his offending in and of itself.
23Puckeridge A-DCJ found that it was the respondent who arranged for the importation of the opium in the samovars and that he was aware both the type of drug and the quantity. He made the arrangements on his own account in that he was not part of a criminal organisation involved in the importation of drugs. His role was, accordingly, significant. He was no mere courier.
24Puckeridge A-DCJ referred to the fact that the respondent is Kurdish and applied for a protection visa by reason of persecution in Iran. He came to Australia as a refugee in 1999. His Honour referred to the following history the respondent gave to Dr Allnutt:
(1)he had used opium from the time he arrived in Australia and was still using it, at the rate of half a gram a day, at the time of the offending for his depression;
(2)he was concerned about his children's welfare;
(3)he suffered from nightmares, and experienced tremors when exposed to prior traumatic events.
25His Honour made the following finding:""I consider that on the evidence before this Court his experiences in Iran were such that it is more than likely that those experiences had an enduring psychological effect upon him and that the evidence as to his intake of opium as at the time of the committing of the offence is evidence to be taken into account as he probably was suffering from the effects of depression as at the time of the committing of the offences.""
26His Honour referred to the report of Ms Salter and the difficulties experienced by the respondent's wife and young children arising from his incarceration. His Honour said in the remarks on sentence:""I have taken these matters into account but have to bear in mind what is stated in s 16A [of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)], that a court must impose a sentence that is of severity appropriate in all circumstances of the offence.""
Procedural matters: balance of charges
27The remaining four counts on the original indictment were the subject of negotiation which resulted in an agreement. The respondent pleaded guilty to two of the remaining four counts and the other two charges were dealt with on a Form 1 pursuant to s 32 and s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and a schedule pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
28These matters were listed for sentence before Haesler DCJ on 22 January 2014 since Puckeridge A-DCJ was no longer available, his final Commission having expired. 
The sentence hearing before Haesler DCJ 
29The facts were agreed and were summarised by Haesler DCJ in the remarks on sentence.
30The respondent created a false identity in order to deposit money in Westpac bank account at Chatswood. In the period from 11 March to 8 June 2011 he deposited a total of $213,687 in seven separate transactions and then instructed a total of $196,370 to be remitted from this account to four individual recipients in Iran. This money, which the respondent knew to be proceeds of crime, derived wholly or partly from the commission of drug-related offences. These facts relate to the first count on the indictment before Haesler DCJ: deal with money that the respondent believed was the proceeds of crime in an amount of more than $100,000, contrary to s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (NSW).
31On or about 18 July 2011 a search warrant was executed on the respondent's storage unit at Rydalmere. A clear plastic bag was found inside a HUGGIES nappy box which contained gross weight of 2,270.8 g of methylamphetamine. The respondent's fingerprints were on the bag and on electronic scales, which were also found in the storage unit. Those scales, and another set found at the respondent's home in Bella Vista, tested positive to traces of methylamphetamine and heroin.
32The possession of 2,270.8 g (gross weight; net weight of 1,777.25 g) of methylamphetamine amounted to a deemed supply of a large commercial quantity (being a quantity in excess of 1 kg) in contravention of Section 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (DMTA). This offence was the second count on the indictment presented before Haesler DCJ. The uncontested evidence of Detective Sergeant Stipnieks was that this amount of methylamphetamine had a street value of $1,135,400 and a wholesale value of $567,500.
33A brown powder substance was also found in the storage unit. It comprised a combination of:(a)morphine with a net weight of 280.9g; and(b)heroin with a gross weight of 894.8 g and a net weight of 574.5 g of pure heroin.
34The deemed supply of a commercial quantity of heroin was on a Form 1 before Haesler DCJ to be taken into account in the sentence for the offence of supply of methylamphetamine. The uncontested evidence of Detective Sergeant Stipnieks was that this amount of heroin had a street value between $574,480 and $670,250 and a wholesale value of $231,400.
35In the course of the execution of the search warrants on 18 July 2011, a total of $348,350 was located: $242,800 in the Blue HUGGIES box in the storage unit and $105,550 at the respondent's home. The money, which the respondent knew to be proceeds of crime, was partly or wholly derived from the commission of drug-related offences. Possession of such substantial amounts of money was beyond the legitimate means of the respondent and his wife, who were both recipients of Centrelink payments. This offence was taken into account in the sentence for count 1 by Haesler DCJ pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
36The Crown tendered the respondent's criminal history and bail report. The respondent tendered the same documents as he had tendered before Puckeridge A-DCJ. In addition he tendered a character reference from Soliman Gilany, who employed the respondent as a cleaner in Department of Housing projects, which contained the following paragraph:""I've seen him as an honest, reliable and family man. He is a community minded individual who puts the needs of others before his own, best evidenced through his community work, both professional and voluntary work.""
Haesler DCJ's remarks on sentence
37Haesler DCJ found that the respondent was a sole trader who was the principal in his own ""fairly large scale supply operation""  which he organised and controlled for his own financial gain. The drugs were being held in storage for a commercial purpose with items that indicated ongoing supply, although the precise way in which this was to be done was not revealed in the evidence. 
38His Honour adverted to the maximum penalty and to the harm that flowed from illicit drugs and said: ""It bears repeating that the sale of illicit drugs causes considerable harm not just to those who purchase and ingest such drugs but to the community in general.  The illicit trade in drugs is one of the principal sources for crime in our community.  It is not just the sale of drugs, it is the crimes that are committed by those who seek to obtain the funds for drugs and the destruction of family life and personal life that drugs cause.  For that reason significant maximum penalties are set by Parliament and for that reason significant penalties must be imposed by sentencing judges.""
39Haesler DCJ referred to the SNPP in the following terms:The standard non-parole period fixed by Parliament must be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence.  I note that that standard non-parole period, here 15 years, represents an offence in the middle of the range of seriousness taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence.
I note I am required to make a record of my reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period and the need to identify the reasons for each factor I take into account.  I am not, as I understand it, required to identify the extent to which the seriousness of the offence for which the non-parole period is set differs from that - an offence to which the standard non-parole period is referable.
There are reasons here for a shorter non-parole period, they include firstly, the plea of guilty, secondly, that the offence is not objectively within the middle of the range.  Given the quantities that could be caught by the section and the level of organisation by this offender and the fact that it was found in storage and not individually packaged, I find that it falls reasonably well below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  I note the subjective matters which I will refer to shortly.  Some subjective matters call for a finding of special circumstances.  There is also a need in this matter for a finding of special circumstances particularly to allow for accumulation and the proper application of the principal of totality.
40Haesler DCJ referred to the respondent's subjective circumstances and found:""He suffered, at the time of this offence and still does, from what Dr Allnutt, exhibit 1, describes as a depressive disorder. This on balance I find relates to and is caused by his background in Iran. Without going into any significant detail, the evidence before me supports that he was, as a Kurd, persecuted, imprisoned, tortured and aware that his brother was executed for his political activities. Those matters founded his being granted a protection visa by the Australian government.
It is clear from the material before me that his opium use could be and probably was related to that background. His opium use and his depression does not and cannot excuse his offending but they may explain his state of mind and why his capacity to exercise sound judgment was impaired.
41Pursuant to s 19AD(2)(e) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) Haesler DCJ fixed a new single non-parole period of six years in respect of all federal sentences that commenced on 18 November 2011 and expired on 17 November 2017. The only sentence imposed by Haesler DCJ which is the subject of appeal is the sentence for the offence relating to methylamphetamine against s 25(2) of the DMTA and the associated count of supply of heroin which was to be taken into account on a Form 1.
The appeal against the sentence imposed by Puckeridge A-DCJ
Principles that relate to Crown appeals42The Crown accepts that its right to appeal should be exercised rarely and principally for the purpose of allowing the Court to lay down principles for the guidance of sentencing judges: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 (Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen) at 465 [1]-[2]. This Court retains a residual discretion in the exercise of the jurisdiction under s 5D to refuse to intervene in a sentence even if error has been demonstrated and manifest inadequacy established. This Court is obliged to consider whether to exercise the residual discretion to dismiss the appeal even in circumstances where the Crown has demonstrated error and established manifest inadequacy: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37 at [24] (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ).
43The limitations that apply to Crown appeals were summarised by McHugh J in Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 306:""Defining the limits of the range of appropriate sentences with respect to a particular offence is a difficult task. What is the range in a particular case is a question on which reasonable minds may differ. It is only when a court of criminal appeal is convinced that the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range that it is ever justified in granting leave to the Crown to appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence. Disagreement about the adequacy of the sentence is not enough to warrant the grant of leave. Sentencing is too inexact a science to make mere disagreement the criterion for the grant of leave to appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence.""
44If this Court considers it appropriate to re-sentence a respondent to a Crown appeal, it is obliged to exercise restraint and re-sentence at the lower end of the acceptable range to overcome the manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed.
45As grounds 1, 2 and 4 are substantially related I propose to address them together. The third ground, which relates to subjective circumstances, is discrete. I shall deal with the third ground first.
Ground 3: Puckeridge A-DCJ erred by taking depressive illness and opium use into account in the commission of the offences in the absence of evidence of a causal or temporal link to the offending
46The respondent did not give evidence at the sentence hearing before Puckeridge A-DCJ. Accordingly, there is no verification of the history he gave to Dr Allnutt other than the documentary material tendered to establish that his brother was executed and that he suffered from depression. The history is of limited weight since the respondent's version could not be challenged by the Crown in cross-examination: R v Niketic [2002] NSWCCA 425 (Wood CJ at CL, Howie J and Smart AJ agreeing).
47Furthermore the respondent denied the offending when he conferred with Dr Allnutt. Puckeridge A-DCJ found that the respondent was suffering from depression at the time of the commission of the relevant offences and said that he took it into account in sentencing the respondent. By implication, Puckeridge A-DCJ regarded the depression as a mitigating factor and appears to have inferred that there was a causal connection between the depression and the commission of the offence, notwithstanding the lack of evidence to support such a finding.
48The respondent submitted that it was open to the sentencing judge to find a causal connection because of the temporal connection. Ms Davenport SC, who appeared on behalf of the respondent, contended that in these circumstances, the respondent's illness was a mitigating circumstance which ought be taken into account in his favour.
49Mental illness is a potentially relevant factor in sentencing. It may bear upon the appropriate sentence in various ways, not all of them mitigating: R v Engert  (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 (Gleeson CJ, Allen and Sully JJ agreeing). However, in my view, it was not open to Puckeridge A-DCJ  to find that the respondent's depression contributed to the commission of the offence. 
50First, as appears from the passage of his report set out above, Dr Allnutt opined that, in circumstances where the respondent denied the offending, such assessment was ""impossible"". Secondly, there is no proper basis to infer a causal connection from a temporal one. Thirdly, one might have thought it less likely that depression, which is a notoriously debilitating illness, could reasonably be regarded as contributing to the conducting of a large-scale successful business that required the transfer of substantial sums of money and illegal goods across the world, particularly where deception was required to mask its illegality.
51ln my view, the erroneous inference the sentencing judge drew as to the connection between the mental illness and the offence led Puckeridge A-DCJ  into the error of regarding the respondent's mental illness as diminishing his moral culpability.
52The third ground has been made out.
53Because of the view to which I have come in relation to ground 4, it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the respondent in any event. Accordingly, there is no need to quantify the effect on the sentence of the third ground having been made out.
Ground 1: Puckeridge A-DCJ  failed to give effect to the principle of totality by accumulating the sentences for counts 1 and 2 by only one yearGround 2: Puckeridge A-DCJ  failed to give effect to the finding that the respondent's role was greater than that of a mere courierGround 4: the sentence was manifestly inadequate
54The Crown accepted that it was likely that the opium in the first count was imported from Iran in the same manner as the opium in the second count. However, it submitted that there was no other connection between the two offences, which formed part of the respondent's business enterprise. The Crown contended that the offences were distinct and represented the respondent's involvement in two critical stages of drug distribution: importation on the one hand, and possession (deemed supply) for the purposes of supply in smaller quantities on the other. It submitted that this factor ought to have reduced the level of concurrency whereas it appears to have increased it. The Crown argued that Puckeridge A-DCJ  failed to pay regard to the finding of the respondent's principal role in the enterprise.
55Furthermore the Crown submitted that the overall sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate having regard to the quantity of drugs and the respondent's involvement.
56Ms Davenport submitted that there was no evidence of actual supply, although she accepted that it could be inferred that the opium had been imported for the purposes of sale and was in the possession of the respondent pending its division into smaller amounts for sale. She submitted that the question of what category in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [207]-[224] (McClellan CJ at CL) was appropriate was largely a matter of judgment which Puckeridge A-DCJ was pre-eminently in a position to make. Ms Davenport contended that the difference between the first count  (importation) and the second count  (deemed supply) was substantially a matter of timing since the first count concerned opium that was arriving and the second count concerned opium that had arrived. In substance, the criminality between the two counts was much the same and, for that reason, the substantial overlap of head sentences was appropriate. 
57I am persuaded that the sentence imposed by Puckeridge A-DCJ was so manifestly inadequate to reflect the criminality of the respondent's importation and possession of opium that it must have involved error: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2005] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 (Hili v The Queen). The sentence imposed by Puckeridge A-DCJ was such as to create an inconsistency in sentencing standards such as to require this Court's intervention to maintain adequate standards of punishment for offences of this kind.
58The manifest inadequacy arose, in my view, from the inadequate accumulation between the sentences imposed for importation of opium on the one hand and supply on the other. 
59Although there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought be dealt with concurrently or consecutively, the principle of totality is an overriding principle by reference to which sentences are to be measured: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 308 (McHugh J). I am persuaded that Puckeridge A-DCJ failed to take account of the overall criminality in accumulating the sentences for the two counts by only one year. 
60In my view, consistent with the principle of restraint in determining Crown appeals, the individual sentences imposed by Puckeridge A-DCJ ought stand but the commencement date for the sentence for the supply offence ought be varied to 18 July 2014 so as to increase the period of accumulation from one year to three years. Having regard to the need to take account of the sentences imposed by Haesler DCJ for the other offences, it is not necessary to express a view about the non-parole period for the opium offences.
The appeal against the sentence imposed by Haesler DCJ
61As grounds 1 and 2 are substantially related I propose to address them together. I shall address ground 3 first since it is distinct from the other two grounds.
Ground 3: Haesler DCJ erred by finding that depressive illness and opium use ought be taken into account in the commission of the offences in the absence of evidence of a causal or temporal link to the offending
62The relevant finding is contained in the passage from Haesler DCJ's remarks on sentence set out above. It was:""[The respondent's] opium use and his depression does not and cannot excuse his offending but they may explain his state of mind and why his capacity to exercise sound judgment was impaired.""
63The Crown submitted, largely for the reasons for which it contended in support of ground 3 against the Puckeridge sentence, that the finding was not supported by the evidence of Dr Allnutt, which was the only evidence adduced that was germane to the connection, if any, between the offending conduct and the respondent's opium use and his mental state. 
64Ms Davenport accepted that the opium use and depression were relevant only to the determination of how onerous a sentence of imprisonment might be for the respondent. She conceded that a connection between them and the criminal conduct could not be made in light of the evidence of Dr Allnutt.
65In my view, Haesler DCJ, in using the word ""may"", may have been engaging in no more than a speculative exercise of envisaging what was possible, as distinct from making a finding. If, however, his Honour took into account a causal connection between the opium use and mental state on the one hand and the offending conduct on the other, this would have amounted to an error, since the evidence did not support the finding.
66Because of the view to which I have come in relation to grounds 1 and 2, it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the respondent in any event. Accordingly, there is no need to quantify the effect on the sentence of the third ground having been made out.
Ground 1: the sentence imposed for the drug offences by Haesler DCJ is manifestly inadequateGround 2: by the sentence imposed for the drug offences, Haesler DCJ failed to have adequate regard for the SNPP
67The SNPP for offences under s 25(2) of the DMTA is 15 years. Accordingly for such offences this represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the objective seriousness of the offence: s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Haesler DCJ was obliged to take it into account: s 54B(2). His Honour also obliged to take into account the respondent's guilty plea: s 22, as his Honour did, by discounting the sentence by 12.5%.
68The remarks on sentence show that Haesler DCJ had regard to the SNPP. His Honour's reasoning as to where the offences fell within the range of objective seriousness appears from the following passage:Given the quantities that could be caught by the section and the level of organisation by this offender and the fact that it was found in storage and not individually packaged, I find that it falls reasonably well below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  
69Although the second ground is expressed in terms of a failure to have adequate regard for the SNPP, the Crown's principal submission was that it was not open to Haesler DCJ, in all the circumstances, to find that the offence of deemed supply of 2,270.8 g of methylamphetamine fell ""reasonably well below the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". The Crown relied on the quantity and value of the drugs and the respondent's role in the enterprise. It submitted that the fact that the methylamphetamine did not happen to have been packaged at the time of the seizure was both inconsequential and fortuitous since the compelling inference was that, in due course, it would be packaged for distribution and sale.
70Ms Davenport submitted on behalf of the respondent that the Crown had, in its submissions to Haesler DCJ, relied on the sentence imposed by Sweeney DCJ on 25 May 2012 on Tien Ly Mac. She contended that the sentence imposed by Haesler DCJ was not out of the range as indicated by the sentence imposed on Mac by Sweeney DCJ and that the Crown, having put it forward as a relevant comparable, ought not be heard to contend to the contrary.
71In that case, Mac was found to have travelled to Vietnam and organised for a shipment of heroin to be delivered to an address owned by him in his daughter's name. Customs intercepted the parcel and found the heroin among packets of tea. When the offender attempted to collect the parcel from the Lakemba Mail Delivery Centre he was arrested. The powder in the parcel had a bulk weight of 1,387.3 g and contained 981 g of pure heroin. Mac was found to be in possession of $554,250 in cash. The jury's verdict of guilty indicated that it rejected his argument that this money was the proceeds of gambling. A large commercial quantity of heroin (1,016.5 g) and a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (1,532.6 g) were found in his home safe, each of which were intended for supply for financial reward. Mac had all of the equipment and supplies necessary to cut, weigh and package the drugs in his possession.
72Mac was a refugee from Vietnam and had no previous convictions. He played an organisational role in having the parcel sent from Vietnam, although others were also involved. Mac knew that the package contained heroin and he knew how much had been sent. His motive was financial gain. 
73Mr Mac was convicted after trial of all four charges and sentenced as follows:

74Mr Mac was convicted after trial. This Court dismissed his appeal against conviction and refused his application for leave to appeal against sentence: Mac v R [2014] NSWCCA 24 (Mac). In Mac it was the offender who sought to challenge the sentence, including on the ground of manifest excess. That this Court did not consider his challenge to the sentence to warrant a grant of leave does not particularly illuminate the issues in this appeal which concern manifest inadequacy.
75Haesler DCJ sentenced the respondent by reference to the agreed facts and the documentary evidence adduced at the sentence hearing. No oral evidence was adduced. Accordingly, the exercise of finding the facts on which the respondent was to be sentenced did not involve the sophisticated evaluative assessment (such as is commonly required following a trial or where the evidence at the sentence hearing is disputed) which was considered by the High Court in Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629 at [18]-[24] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ).
76As Spigelman CJ (Simpson J agreeing) said in R v Mulato [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37]:""Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.""
77If this Court finds that the characterisation made by Haesler DCJ was not open to his Honour, this Court is entitled to form a different view as to where, in the objective scale of offending, the respondent's conduct stood, although this Court is bound by his Honour's findings of facts, to the extent to which they are not challenged: Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13 at [24]. 
78In my view, it was not open to Haesler DCJ to characterise the respondent's offence of supply of methylamphetamine as below the middle of the range of objective seriousness having regard to his Honour's finding that the respondent was a sole trader in a ""fairly large scale drug importation"" and the undisputed quantity of the methylamphetamine. 
79Although, as the High Court found in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 (Wong), at [73], the proposition that the gravity of a drug offence can usually be assessed by reference to the weight of the drug is false, the converse is not. In the circumstances of the present case, the quantity of the drug concerned is, in my view, material to the objective seriousness of the offending conduct. The methylamphetamine was in the respondent's possession for the purposes of supply in the course of his own business for his personal financial gain. He was no mere bit player, or courier, who might be regarded as being ignorant of the details of quantity and purity (cf. Wong at [68] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ). The amount found in his possession was over twice the minimum amount that would have qualified as a ""large commercial quantity"". 
80There are some similarities between Mac and the instant case. It was, in my view, appropriate for the Crown at the sentence hearing to include it in the list of sentences to which regard might be had by Haesler DCJ in passing sentence on the applicant. However, care must be taken in drawing direct comparisons between sentences passed, those to be passed and those which are, or have been, the subject of appeal: see generally, Hili v The Queen at [53]- [56] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ. 
81In my view, his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the respondent's criminality in his commission of the offence concerning methylamphetamine as being ""reasonably below the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" was not reasonably open to his Honour. Accordingly, the second ground has been made out.
82The first ground is that the sentence imposed by Haesler DCJ was manifestly inadequate. Like manifest excess, manifest inadequacy, is a conclusion that does not require identification of a specific error: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6] (Gleeson CJ and Hayne J). The error the subject of the second ground has been identified and made out but the determination of the first ground requires the conclusion to be examined.
83The sentence imposed by Haesler DCJ for the drug offences was seven years to date from 18 July 2016 with a non-parole period of three years.
84The non-parole period should be the minimum period that an offender must spend in gaol having regard to all the relevant considerations, including the objective seriousness of the crime, deterrence and the subjective circumstances: Power v R (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 627-629. These considerations are also relevant to the fixing of the total term. The ratio between the non-parole period and the total term is a matter for the sentencing judge, who is bound by the statutory ratio, subject to finding special circumstances: s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 44 applies to sentences for federal offences, by reason of s 16E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
85Paying due regard to the discretion of Haesler DCJ and the flexible approach allowed to sentencing judges in structuring sentences, I consider that Haesler DCJ failed sufficiently to reflect the totality of the criminality of the offending conduct, having regard to the sentences imposed by Puckeridge A-DCJ. I consider the sentence imposed to have been so manifestly inadequate that it must have involved error: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen.
86The offence for which the respondent was sentenced by Haesler DCJ and the count to be taken into account on the Form 1 not only involved different drugs than those for which Puckeridge A-DCJ sentenced him, but  involved different offending conduct. 
87In my view the sentence imposed by Haesler DCJ was manifestly inadequate, both as to the non-parole period and as to the total term, having regard to the respondent's criminal culpability concerning heroin and methylamphetamines. The sentence imposed on Mac does not, in my view, provide a reason for concluding that the sentence imposed in the present case was other than inadequate, and, in my view, manifestly so.  
88Where a sentencing judge passes sentence on an offender who has already been sentenced by another judge, the second judge must regard the first sentence as an appropriate exercise of the first judge's discretion. Accordingly, whatever view Haesler DCJ formed about the Puckeridge sentence, his Honour was bound by it and was not entitled to seek to reduce or increase it by the sentences his Honour imposed: R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at [99] per Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ.
89In my view, the sentence imposed by Haesler DCJ ought be varied to increase the total term by two years from seven years to nine years to date from 18 July 2017. This is, in my view, the minimum sentence, in the circumstances which include the Form 1 offence, to overcome the manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed. The taking into account of the Form 1 offence pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ought, in my view, increase the sentence beyond that which would be required for the count 2 offence alone: see the summary of relevant principles in Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115. 
90The accumulation of sentences is conventionally regarded as providing the basis for a finding of special circumstances in respect of the last of a number of sentences imposed, in order to achieve an appropriate relationship between the effective non-parole period and the overall term. For the reasons given below I consider that the non-parole period stipulated by Haesler DCJ in respect of the drug offence ought be varied from 3 years to 4 years.
91In these circumstances there is no need to vary the order made by Haesler DCJ pursuant to s 19AD(2)(e) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) fixing a new single non-parole period of six years for all federal offences, which commenced on 18 July 2011 and will expire on 17 July 2017.
The total effective sentence imposed
92For the reasons given above, I am persuaded that each of the Puckeridge and Haesler sentences were infected by the specific errors identified and were manifestly inadequate. 
93However, it does not follow from this conclusion that the appeal ought be allowed since the total effective sentence imposed, if not manifestly inadequate, ought stand. It is therefore necessary to address the total effective sentence since it is only if it, too, is manifestly inadequate that the appeal ought be allowed, and even then, it ought only be allowed if this Court decides not to exercise the residual discretion.
94The total effective sentence for the whole criminality is 12 years to date from 18 July 2011 with a NPP of 8 years to expire on 17 July 2019 and the total sentence to expire on 17 July 2023.
95I reject Ms Davenport's submission that when the effective sentences imposed by Puckeridge A-DCJ and Haesler DCJ are considered together, it could not be said that a total head sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years was outside the limits of the range for the offending conduct.
96In my view, the total effective sentence is manifestly inadequate. The respondent's criminality involved the importation of opium and the supply and possession of opium, heroin and methylamphetamine. He was a sole trader, importer and wholesaler of these drugs. The quantities involved, their value and the concomitant cash generated by the business was substantial. The difficulty of detecting such offences and the great social consequences that follow from their commission, together with the quantities of drug involved, the respondent's role in their future distribution and the potential rewards to the respondent for his participation are factors that require a sentence to be imposed which is greater than the total effective sentence actually imposed by Puckeridge A-DCJ and Haesler DCJ.
97In my view, but for the residual discretion, the exercise of which is considered below, it would be appropriate to re-sentence the respondent. As indicated above, I consider that the Puckeridge A-DCJ sentence ought be varied as follows:CountOffenceVaried sentence 1Import marketable quantity (14,875.9 g) border controlled drug (opium)Imprisonment for 7 years to date from 18/7/2011 and to expire on 17/7/20182Possess marketable quantity (8,342.1 g) of border controlled drug (opium) reasonably suspected of having been unlawfully importedImprisonment for 7 years to date from 18/7/2014 and to expire on 17/7/2021 
98As indicated above, I consider that the Haesler sentence, in so far as it concerns the drug offences should be varied as follows:
No.OffenceVaried sentence 2Deemed supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, being an amount not less than 1 kg: 2,270.8 gImprisonment for 9 years to date from 18/7/17 Non-parole period of 4 years.Form 1Deemed supply of a commercial quantity of heroin, being an amount not less than 250 g: 894.8 g
99This would have the effect of increasing the total effective sentence for all offences from 12 years to 15 years. The effective total non-parole period after the Haesler DCJ sentence had been imposed was 8 years, or 2/3 of the total effective sentence. The Crown did not submit, as a separate ground, that the ratio between the total effective non-parole period and the total effective sentence was, of itself, erroneous. In these circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to maintain the ratio arrived at by Haesler DCJ. Accordingly I consider that the total effective non-parole period ought be varied from 8 years to 10 years, in order to maintain the ratio between the total term and the non-parole period. As referred to above, this would be achieved by varying the non-parole period for the drug offence for which Haesler DCJ sentenced the respondent from three years to four years.
100The first date on which the respondent would be eligible for release would be, if he were re-sentenced on this basis, 18 July 2021.
101I note that the effect of the re-sentence is to leave undisturbed the sentence imposed by Haesler DCJ for the offences concerning dealing with proceeds of crime, which would then be entirely subsumed in the new sentence for the drug offences. This produces a result which does not impose any effective punishment on the respondent for these offences. However, in all the circumstances I consider it preferable to leave this part of the sentence undisturbed since there was no challenge to it and accordingly no need for this Court to lay down any guidance to sentencing judges in respect of it.
The residual discretion
102The factors relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion in any given case include delay, parity, the totality principle, rehabilitation, fault on the part of the Crown and significant deterioration in the respondent's health or mental well-being in the period between the imposition of the sentence and the hearing of the appeal: DPP v Karazisis [2010] VSCA 350; 31 VR 634 at [104]-[115], cited with approval in Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38 at [72], footnote 71 (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Gageler and Keane JJ); see also Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [43] (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ).
103Ms Davenport did not put forward any reason why the residual discretion ought be exercised in the respondent's favour. Nor does any reason emerge from the evidence.
104There is no issue of delay. By email dated 15 October 2013 from the Crown to his solicitors, the respondent was given notice that the Crown was considering an appeal against the Puckeridge sentence, which had been passed a week before, on 8 October 2013. The respondent was notified that the Notice of Appeal had been filed on 7 November 2013. By email dated 31 January 2014, the respondent was notified that the  Crown was considering an appeal against the Haesler sentence, which had been passed on 22 January 2014. The respondent was notified by email of the filing of a notice of appeal on 21 February 2014, the date of filing. Notification of two further grounds was given on 3 March 2014.
105I am not persuaded that it is appropriate to exercise the residual discretion in the respondent's favour to dismiss the Crown appeal. 
Proposed orders
106The orders I propose are:
(1)Allow the appeal.
(2)Vary the sentence imposed by Puckeridge A-DCJ on 8 October 2013 by altering the commencement date in respect of count 2 from 18 July 2012 to 18 July 2014;
(3)Vary the sentence imposed by Haesler DCJ on 22 January 2014 by: 
(a)increasing the sentence for the offence of supplying methylamphetamine from 7 years to 9 years; and
(b)altering the commencement date for that sentence from 18 July 2016 to 18 July 2017 and increasing the non-parole period from 3 years to 4 years.
(4)Note that the first date on which the respondent will be eligible for release is 18 July 2021.

2763790,Boatswain v State Parole Authority [2014] NSWSC 501,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Warwick Boatswain (""the plaintiff"") challenges a decision of the State Parole Authority (""the Parole Authority"") made on 2 July 2013 to refuse to release him on parole.  
2The Parole Authority is the first defendant and has filed a submitting appearance.  The second defendant is the Attorney General of New South Wales and is the active opponent.
Background
3The plaintiff was sentenced on 18 December 1992 in respect of a number of very serious offences including seven counts of aggravated sexual assault and two counts of robbery.  He was on parole at the time those offences were committed.  The total effective sentence imposed upon him was one of imprisonment for 23 years with a non-parole period of 15 years.  
4The plaintiff became eligible for release on parole on 29 July 2006 but the Parole Authority has refused all applications for release. The total term of the sentences is due to expire on 29 July 2014.
5The Serious Offenders Review Council (""the SORC"") was constituted under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Act""): s 195.  One of its various functions is ""to provide reports and advice to the Parole Authority concerning the release on parole of serious offenders"": s 197(2)(b). 
6The plaintiff is within the definition of a ""serious offender"" because his non-parole period was ""at least 12 years"": s 3. 
7On 16 April 2013, the SORC provided a report to the Parole Authority in which it advised:
""[I]t is appropriate for the [plaintiff] to be considered now for release on parole"". 
8Subdivision 3 of Pt 6 Div 2 of the Act deals with the consideration of parole in respect of serious offenders.  It provides that on or immediately after giving its preliminary consideration as to whether or not a serious offender should be released on parole, the Parole Authority must formulate and record its initial intention either to make a parole order or not: s 144. 
9On 30 May 2013 the Parole Authority formulated an initial intention to grant parole.  It was then required, by s 145, to notify any victims whose names are recorded on the Victims Register (that is, victims who have requested to be given notice of the possible parole of the offender).  It is not apparent that any of the plaintiff's victims had made such a request and were recorded on the Victims Register.  Certainly there is nothing to indicate that any such victim sought to be heard on the matter.
10The State of New South Wales has a right to make submissions to the Parole Authority concerning the release on parole of a serious offender: s 153.  After having formulated its initial intention to release the plaintiff on parole, the matter was adjourned to 2 July 2013 to allow the State the opportunity to do so if it wished.
11Written submissions by the State were filed on 1 July 2013.  It opposed the plaintiff's release on parole, based on the offender's ""prior history of serious violent sexual offences and his considerable difficulty in engaging in programs to assist with his rehabilitation and continuation of drug abuse and aggressive behaviour whilst in prison"".
12The hearing on 2 July 2013 involved the plaintiff appearing by audio-visual link and without representation (a matter of his choice).  He gave sworn evidence and made submissions.  Short evidence was also taken from a Probation and Parole Officer and further oral submissions were made on behalf of the State.  The hearing culminated with the Parole Authority announcing that its decision was to refuse parole and that it would provide reasons on 16 July 2013.  
13On 16 July 2013 there was a brief hearing.  Written reasons for the decision refusing parole were provided to the parties.
The proceedings
14These proceedings were commenced by the filing of a Summons on 29 January 2014. There was some explanation proffered at the hearing for the delay but it is unnecessary to refer to it.
15An amended summons (filed by leave at the hearing without objection) sets out the relief sought by the plaintiff in the following terms:
1. Leave to institute the proceedings under s 4 of the Felons (Civil Proceedings Act) 1981 (NSW). 2. A declaration under s 155 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) that the Parole Authority relied on false, misleading or irrelevant information in the decision, and the reasons therefore.
3. An order in the nature of certiorari pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) quashing the decision of the Parole Authority refusing to order the release of the plaintiff on parole.
4. An order in the nature of mandamus pursuant to s 69 and pursuant to the terms of s 65 of the Supreme Court Act that the Parole Authority convene and fulfil its public duty by determining the plaintiff's application for parole in accordance with the law.
Preliminary considerations 
16An application under s 155 of the Act ""is to be considered by the Supreme Court if and only if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application"":  s 155(3). 
17I was satisfied that the application was not an abuse of process and there was sufficient evidence to support it and so the application under s 155 was considered.  The Attorney General did not contend otherwise.
18Section 4 of the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981 (NSW) is in the following terms:
""A person who is in custody as a result of having been convicted of, or found to have committed, a serious indictable offence may not institute any civil proceedings in any court except by the leave of that court granted on application."" 
19Section 5 of that Act provides that: 
""A court shall not, under section 4, grant leave to a person to institute proceedings unless the court is satisfied that the proceedings are not an abuse of process and that there is prima facie ground for the proceedings.""
20Mr Boatswain was convicted of a serious indictable offence, meaning an indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more: s 4 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  Patsalis v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 307 supports the view that leave is not required to bring judicial review proceedings where, inter alia, they are concerned with a question of parole release.  The Attorney General did not oppose leave being granted, but I am not satisfied that it is required. 
A declaration under s 155 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act that the Parole Authority relied on false, misleading or irrelevant information in the decision, and the reasons therefore
21Section 155 is in the following terms:
""(1) If: (a) the Parole Authority decides that an offender should not be released on parole, and (b) the offender alleges that the decision of the Parole Authority has been made on the basis of false, misleading or irrelevant information, the offender may, in accordance with rules of court, apply to the Supreme Court for a direction to be given to the Parole Authority as to whether the information was false, misleading or irrelevant. 
(2) The Supreme Court may give such directions with respect to the information as it thinks fit. 
(3) An application under this section is to be considered by the Supreme Court if and only if it is satisfied that the application is not an abuse of process and that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the application. 
(4) This section does not give the Supreme Court jurisdiction to consider the merits of the Parole Authority's decision otherwise than on the grounds referred to in subsection (1)."" 
22The terms of sub-s (1) clearly indicate that the provision is concerned with information upon which the decision of the Parole Authority is based.  It is not concerned with the findings of fact made by the Parole Authority or the conclusions that it draws that are based upon such findings.
23The second ground set out in the amended summons contends as follows:
""In its decision of 2 July 2013 the first defendant erred in law by relying on false, misleading or irrelevant information concerning:
a. the plaintiff's conduct in custody, participation in treatment and motivation to do same;
b. the potential for the plaintiff to participate in day/weekend leave; and
c. the potential for proceedings under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW).""
24Counsel for the plaintiff raised a number of issues about certain findings of fact and conclusions drawn by the Parole Authority concerning those matters.  However those findings and conclusions are more for consideration in relation to the plaintiff's other grounds.  Counsel was unable to identify any information in the oral or documentary evidence that was before the Parole Authority that could be characterised as ""false, misleading or irrelevant"".  For that reason, this ground must fail.
Prerogative relief sought in four respects
25The orders sought by the plaintiff are certiorari and mandamus. Rothman J in Esho v Parole Board Authority of NSW [2006] NSWSC 304 (""Esho"") provided the following summary of certiorari and mandamus in this context:
""[29] Certiorari will issue against any body having authority under the law to determine issues affecting the rights of subjects, which body, having the right to act judicially, act otherwise than in accordance with its legal authority so to do: see R v Electricity Commissioners [1924] 1 KB 171 at 205 per Atkin LJ. Section 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 allows the issue of orders in the nature of certiorari and ameliorates some of the technicalities associated, historically, with the issue of the writ. Sections 65 and 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 do the same in relation to mandamus. There can be no doubt that the Parole Authority, in exercising the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999, as amended, is amenable to such prerogative writs: LMS v Parole Board (1999) 110 A Crim R 172. Further, the capacity to grant or refuse parole is a matter which ""affects the rights of subjects"" as it has been interpreted in modern times: see Banks v Transport Regulations Board (1968) 119 CLR 222 and R v Victorian Industrial Appeals Court; ex parte Victorian Chamber of Manufactures [1975] VR 84. 
[30] There are four essential grounds for the grant of certiorari being: jurisdictional error; denial of natural justice; fraud; and error of law on the face of the record. There are nice questions as to whether a denial of natural justice is, in any event, a jurisdictional error, but the question is of academic interest only, in a case such as this where no privative clause exists. Under the common law, certiorari would issue only for an error of law on the face of the record, which record did not include the reasons for decision: see Craig v SA (1995) 184 CLR 163. By the operation of sub-section 69(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 the legislature has defined the face of the record to include the reasons for any decision. 
[31] Mandamus, on the other hand, will issue only for jurisdictional error being an actual or constructive refusal to exercise jurisdiction. However, once certiorari has issued to quash a relevant decision, then the public duty reposed in the body remains unexercised and mandamus will issue.""
26His Honour continued (at [33]) that while certiorari may lie for error of law on the face of the record:
""it is not every error for which certiorari will issue. It must be an error upon which the judgment is based and it must be an error of a kind that affects the task undertaken by the tribunal. Of course, it can be an error of law which is not jurisdictional. An administrative tribunal lacks authority to determine questions of law authoritatively or bindingly or to make an order or decision otherwise in accordance with the law. 
'If such an administrative tribunal falls into an error of law which causes it to identify a wrong issue, to ask itself a wrong question, to ignore relevant material, to rely on irrelevant material or, at least in some circumstances, to make an erroneous finding or to reach a mistaken conclusion and the tribunal's exercise or purported exercise of power is thereby affected, it exceeds its authority or powers. Such an error of law is jurisdictional error which will invalidate any order or decision of the tribunal which reflects it.' (Craig (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179)"".

27It follows from this that certiorari will lie only if the Parole Authority has made an error upon which its judgment was based or if the error was of a kind that affected the duties imposed on it by the legislature. 
28The third and fourth prayers for relief, that is, the orders for certiorari and mandamus, relied upon four aspects in which it is contended that the Parole Authority fell into jurisdictional error in determining the plaintiff's application for parole.  They will be dealt with in turn.
Contrary to s 152 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act the Parole Authority made its final decision on 2 July 2013 before allowing the SORC to make submissions about the rejection of its advice. This was an error going to jurisdiction and constituted a failure to take into account a relevant consideration
29Section 152 is in the following terms:
(1) If the Parole Authority rejects the advice of the Review Council concerning the release on parole of a serious offender, the Parole Authority must state in writing its reasons for rejecting that advice. 
(2) The Parole Authority must forward a copy of those reasons to the Review Council. 
(3) The Review Council may make submissions to the Parole Authority concerning the rejection of its advice within 21 days of that rejection. 
(4) The Parole Authority is not to make a final decision concerning the release of the offender during the period referred to in subsection (3).
30The first issue is to identify what ""advice"" was provided to the Parole Authority by the SORC.  I have mentioned it earlier; it was that the plaintiff be ""considered now for release on parole"".   It is noteworthy that the advice did not ""recommend"" parole release, simply that it be ""considered"".
31The SORC report began by referring to its previous reports in the period 2006 to 2012.  In each of the years 2006 to 2009 it had advised that it was ""not appropriate for the plaintiff to be considered for release on parole"".  In 2010 it ""deferred its recommendation pending further assessment"".  In 2011 it advised that it was appropriate for the plaintiff to be considered for release on parole.  But in 2012 it advised that it was ""not appropriate for the offender to be considered for release on parole"". (Emphasis added.)
32The report then reviewed various assessments of the plaintiff since its last report.  They concerned matters such as his classification and placement, drug use issues, and engagement with rehabilitation programs.  It noted (at paragraph 10) a report by a community corrections officer of 8 April 2013 in which it was said, in part, that ""a decision regarding parole recommendation remains pending at this stage and may be more likely within approximately 4 weeks time"". 
33The report concluded with ""Advice of the Council to State Parole Authority"" and I will reproduce what was said in full:
""Council notes paragraph 10.  However it is of the view that the offender's capacity to be supervised in the Community should be tested.  He has overall changed in a positive way.  It is noted that 'extended supervision' only is being looked at.  Council advises that it is appropriate for the offender to be considered now for release on parole, taking into account the expiry date of his sentence.
In preparing this advice the Review Council has had regard to the matters to be considered under sections 197 & 198 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999.
Authenticated pursuant to Clause 18 of Schedule 2 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 as a member of the Serious Offenders Review Council presiding at the meeting of the Council held on 16 April 2013 when this report was approved.""
Submissions 
34In written submissions, counsel for the plaintiff contended that by refusing parole on 2 July 2013 the Parole Authority had ""rejected"" the advice of the SORC.  Section 152 required it to provide written reasons for such rejection so as to allow the SORC to make submissions before any final decision was made. As a result, there was jurisdictional error in making a final decision contrary to the requirements of s 152.  Further, the Parole Authority failed to have regard to a relevant consideration, namely further submissions (if any) of the SORC.
35In relation to the SORC advising in terms that parole release should be ""considered"", counsel submitted that the overall tenor of the SORC report amounted to positive support for a favourable decision.  Saying that parole should be ""considered"" should be regarded as an indication that the SORC thought that it should happen.  The use of the term ""considered"" should be understood in the context of s 135(3) (as to which, see below). 
36Both parties devoted considerable attention to the respective roles and functions of the Parole Authority and the SORC and the matters each was required to consider on the question of a serious offender being released on parole.  There was no real dispute about these matters; they are readily apparent from the text of the various provisions of the Act to which counsel referred.  All that is necessary to note is that it was common ground that it is the role of SORC, amongst other things, to provide advice to the Parole Authority concerning parole for serious offenders (s 197(2)(b)) and it is the role of the Parole Authority to determine questions of parole (s 185(1)(a)).
37It was submitted for the Attorney General that the Parole Authority had the report of the SORC before it when it formulated its initial intention to grant parole.  It did accept the SORC's advice to ""consider"" parole and formed an intention to grant it.  It was not required to advise the SORC of its final determination.
Determination
38There is nothing in the Act that prevents the SORC advising the Parole Authority in terms that it recommends that parole be granted.
39Section 135 sets out the ""General duty of Parole Authority"" in considering whether to make a parole order in respect of a sentence for which a non-parole period of more than 3 years has been set by the sentencing court.  It provides in sub-s 2 a list of matters to which the Parole Authority ""must have regard"".  One matter in that list (in s 135(2)(i)) is any report ""in relation to the granting of parole to the offender that has been prepared by or on behalf of the [Serious Offenders] Review Council"".   Subsection 3 provides:
""(3) Except in exceptional circumstances, the Parole Authority must not make a parole order for a serious offender unless the Review Council advises that it is appropriate for the offender to be considered for release on parole.""
40What that means is that, absent exceptional circumstances, if the SORC advises that it is not appropriate for parole release to be considered, the Parole Authority cannot make a parole order.  That is all the provision entails.  It is a form of gateway provision.  It does not constrain the nature of the advice that the SORC can provide.  There is nothing to prevent the SORC advising that parole should be granted.  The final decision remains one for the Parole Authority.  If the SORC advises that it is appropriate for parole to be considered, all it is doing is saying, in effect, that there is no bar to the making of a parole order but whether such an order should be made is a matter for the Parole Authority.
41In relation to s 135, counsel for the plaintiff referred to the second reading speech of the Hon John Hatzistergos, Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Premier on Citizenship in relation to the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Amendment (Parole) Bill 2004: New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 9 December 2004 at 13,815.  The Minister said:
""The Government is of the view that the emphasis of the parole system should be on what is right for the community. The provisions of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Amendment (Parole) Bill 2004 will closely align the parole system with the expectations of the community.  A particular focus for the Government has been on the interests of victims of crime.
...
The need to protect the community is a theme that flows through the bill.  Proposed new section 135 relates to the general duty of the SPA [the Parole Authority].  New section 135(2) contains several matters that previously the SPA did not have to take into account in deciding whether the release of an offender was in the public interest.  The new matters that must be taken into account are the need to protect the community, the need to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, the nature and circumstances of the offence, and guidelines established by the SPA in consultation with the Minister in relation to the exercise of the SPA's functions.
...
In keeping with the emphasis on the protection of the community, new section 135(3) provides that except in exceptional circumstances the SPA is not to release a serious offender on parole unless the Serious Offenders Review Council [SORC] advises the SPA that it is appropriate for the offender to be considered for release on parole.  This provision recognises the fact that the information on which the SORC relies to prepare reports and to provide advice concerning the release on parole of an offender is accumulated over a lengthy period.""
42The provision of s 135(3) was clearly one of the measures intended to promote protection of the community.  It was designed to prevent the release on parole, absent exceptional circumstances, of serious offenders in respect of whom the SORC considers such release would be inappropriate.  That is as far as it goes.
43The advice of the SORC was not ""rejected"" by the Parole Authority.  It did ""consider"" making a parole order when it formulated its initial intention to grant parole and in its final decision to refuse parole.  A requirement for it to permit the SORC to make submissions pursuant to s 152 did not arise.
There was an insufficient evidentiary basis for the Parole Authority's conclusions about the plaintiff's conduct in custody, participation in treatment and motivation in relation to treatment.  The plaintiff was denied procedural fairness in relation to the latter.  The absence of evidence for the conclusions reached constituted an error of law
44This contention of error related, in part, to a portion of the reasons of the Parole Authority delivered on 16 July 2013 that the plaintiff had:
""for the balance of his incarceration continued to use illicit substances, not complied with prison discipline and has declined to undertake programs that may have assisted [him] to be rehabilitated"". 
45It was argued that this statement was wrong because the plaintiff's last disciplinary offence for using illicit substances was on 22 February 2012; he had not been charged with any internal disciplinary offence in the period since the last parole hearing in 2012; a community corrections officer's report included that he had complied with prison discipline; and he had completed some rehabilitation programs, one in 2009 and another in 2013.
46What the Parole Authority meant in the passage quoted above must be understood by reference to its use of the term ""balance of his incarceration"" and by reference to the reasons as a whole.  In various passages of the reasons there is reference to the change in attitude by the plaintiff in the previous 18 months or so.  For example:
""A review of reports prior to 2011 reveals the Offender was less than co-operative as an Inmate.  He was on a not irregular basis subject to institutional discipline and charges.  He remained resistant to addressing his offending behaviour and elected not to participate in programs.  In early 2011, he refused to participate in psychological treatment stating he had dealt with his issues of offending.  He refused to participate in CUBIT and was unwilling to sign onto SMAP, as he did not want to be housed with 'child molesters'.  He said 'why participate if participation brings no benefits'.
It is further apparent from records the Offender elected sometime during late 2011, early 2012 to address his rehabilitation, that is he elected to address his rehabilitation toward the end of his Head Sentence.
...
Mr Bolton [community corrections officer] reported that since the previous Pre-release report the Offender had not been subject to any internal discipline and that case notes indicate the Offender had demonstrated an improved prison performance and caused little concern for correctional centre management.  He reported the Offender had completed the Getting SMART program and achieved a favourable report and further the Offender would be referred to Forensic Psychology Services for participation in the CUBIT Maintenance Program."" 
47It is quite apparent that when the Parole Authority spoke of the plaintiff having ""continued to use illicit substances, not complied with prison discipline and ... declined to undertake programs"" it was talking about the period prior to late 2011- early 2012.  That explains the reference to ""balance of his incarceration"". It follows from this that there was not an absence of evidence for the conclusions reached by the Parole Authority regarding the plaintiff's conduct in custody, participation in treatment programs and motivation to undertake treatment for the ""balance of his incarceration"". It was open to the Parole Authority to reach the conclusions it did based on the evidence before it. 
48There was, however, an error in finding that at the hearing the offender indicated a lack of motivation for undertaking therapy or rehabilitation.  It related to something he said in his evidence (referred to as ""submissions"").  What he said was:
""[S]ince 2012, in February, I cleaned my act up. I stayed out of trouble, I stopped using, you know, I put my head down and I didn't want to get to the end of my sentence and then be taken to the Supreme Court and have my sentence extended, really, like seven years is a long time to be over my parole period and if you weigh up not the original offences, which are - well, no matter what sentence you give me, no one would ever be satisfied, but I done a lot of therapy, a lot of rehabilitation.  You can't please everyone.  You try.  You do your best and sometimes other circumstances arise which puts you in a bad light and it's not down to me sometimes, but it's just the nature of the system.""
49After referring to the reports and records indicating a more improved attitude and response by the plaintiff since ""sometime during late 2011, early 2012"" the reasons of the Parole Authority continued:
""The State submits his change of attitude was purely for the benefit of obtaining Parole and not for the purpose of true rehabilitation.  Further the State submits the Offender has a long standing illicit substance problem and such is reflected and observed by the Authority when perusing records of his institutional misconduct and the level of prescribed daily methadone, despite having spent in excess of 20 years in custody.  
The State Submission gains some support from the sworn submissions of the Offender this day. The Offender in his submission stated he cleaned his act up in February 2011. He stopped using.  He did not want to be taken to the Supreme Court and have his sentence extended.  He further stated he did not want therapy or rehabilitation and that he was trying to do the right thing and not waste his life further."" (Reasons pp 2-3) (Emphasis added)
50Towards the end of the reasons it was stated:
""He elected to undertake programs, comply with discipline and cease using illicit substances when it became apparent to [him] that he was nearing the completion of his Head Sentence.  The Offender asks the Authority to accept he 'saw the light' and elected to reform.  The Authority has severe reservations such is the case, particularly when the offender in his sworn submissions this day stated that he did not want to be taken to the Supreme Court and have his sentence extended and did not want to undergo therapy or rehabilitation.
It is apparent to the Authority based on those statements the Offender would be highly unlikely to participate in ongoing programs ... .""  (Reasons pp 4-5) (Emphasis added)
51The Attorney General conceded that what the Parole Authority said about the plaintiff's motivation to undergo therapy or rehabilitation was ""a mistake"".  But it was submitted that it was apparent from what was said in other passages of the reasons that the Parole Authority was aware that the plaintiff had undergone rehabilitative programs.  It had various reports and other evidence concerning those programs.  For that reason, it was submitted that I should conclude that the misstatement as to the effect of the plaintiff's evidence was not material to the Parole Authority's conclusion.
52I am not persuaded that the misstatement was immaterial.  
53Towards the end of the reasons (p 4.8) it was stated that the Parole Authority was not satisfied the community would be safe or protected or that public confidence in the administration of justice could be maintained if the plaintiff was released on parole.  These were undoubtedly references to the mandatory criteria in s 135(2)(a) and (b). The reasons conclude as follows:
""The Authority determines it is inappropriate for the Offender to be Paroled as it cannot be satisfied for the safety of the community."" (Reasons p 5.5)
54A motivation and willingness to continue to engage in rehabilitation programs would undoubtedly have been relevant and influential in the Parole Authority's assessment of the criterion concerning the protection of the safety of the community.  But it formed a negative view that was founded to a significant extent upon a complete misapprehension of the evidence before it. 
55That this issue of preparedness to engage in rehabilitation problems was influential in the ultimate decision can be seen in the reference to the evidence of the plaintiff providing support for the submission of the State that the plaintiff's change of attitude was not for the purpose of true rehabilitation.  It can also be seen by the Parole Authority having ""severe reservations"" about the plaintiff's claim to have ""'seen the light' and ""elected to reform"".
56A similar error was identified in Esho. In that case there were expert reports before the Parole Authority that indicated that the offender had a low to moderate likelihood of re-offending. Rothman J said (at [56]):
""In those circumstances there is no basis, on the evidence, upon which the Parole Authority could possibly have found the claimant was not 'able to adapt to normal lawful community life' ... The finding of the Parole Authority, in the absence of evidence, is an error of law."" 
57There was no evidence before the Parole Authority that the offender lacked motivation in relation to treatment and accordingly there was an error of law. 
58The plaintiff also claimed that the conclusion of the Parole Authority on this point was never raised with the plaintiff at the hearing, constituting a denial of procedural fairness. ""When a statute confers power upon a public official to destroy, defeat or prejudice a person's rights, interests or legitimate expectations, the rules of natural justice regulate the exercise of that power unless they are excluded by plain words of necessary intendment"": Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57; 170 CLR 596 at 598 (Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ). 
59One of the rules of natural justice is that the person has an opportunity to be heard. The contention that the plaintiff lacked motivation in relation to treatment was never put to him during the hearing and accordingly the Parole Authority denied the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard on that point. I accept that there was a denial of procedural fairness.
The potential for the plaintiff to participate in day/weekend leave was an irrelevant consideration
60The Parole Authority referred to the fact that the plaintiff had not been afforded an opportunity to participate in daily, nightly or weekend leave.  That was because his security classification had never been reduced to the level where such leave could be permitted.
61It was submitted that it was wrong for this to be taken into account because it had been an impossibility.  Counsel for the plaintiff sought to liken it to the unavailability of a rehabilitation program because of a language barrier in Esho.  There, Rothman J held that taking into account the possibility of treatment which was not available, the Parole Authority had taken into account an irrelevant consideration, thereby erring in law and in the exercise of its jurisdiction.
62The situation in Esho is not entirely analogous.  There, the plaintiff's English language skills were so limited that the program in question was not, and never would be, available to him.  In the present case, temporary leave from prison was theoretically available to the plaintiff.  The fact that he had not progressed to the appropriate security classification to render it potentially available was largely a product of his conduct in previous years.
63More fundamentally, however, when the reasons of the Parole Authority are read as a whole, it is plain that the question of leave was discussed in the context of its reference to the plaintiff being ""institutionalised"".  An assessment of his capability of adapting to normal lawful community life (s 135(2)(f)) had to be made in the absence of any demonstration of how he might conduct himself in the community.  Thus it was stated:
""It could not be said the Authority is in any position to determine [whether] the Offender would be able to adapt to normal community life.""  (Reasons p 4.3)
64Further, it needs to be borne in mind that the Parole Authority was concerned about the level of risk of further offending.  It was a relevant consideration that there was no evidence about how he might perform when back in the community.
The potential for proceedings under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) was an irrelevant consideration
65It was submitted for the plaintiff that ""it is clear from the Parole Authority's decision that it placed weight on the fact that if parole was not granted, the prospect of the plaintiff being released into the community without ever having been granted leave from prison could be alleviated through the State making an application under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act"".  This, it was submitted, was an irrelevant consideration.
66Counsel for the plaintiff contended that the task of the Parole Authority pursuant to s 135 was to decide whether or not parole release ""is appropriate in the public interest"".  Consideration of matters that may, or may not, occur in the future had no bearing upon whether or not it ""is"" (counsel emphasised the present tense) appropriate for an offender to be released.
67It was submitted that the way in which the Parole Authority took this factor into account was a prominent feature of its consideration of the plaintiff's parole application.
68An alternative point was sought to be made and that is that by giving attention to the potential availability of an extended supervision order being made under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act, the Parole Authority failed to ask itself the correct question: whether or not it was presently in the public interest to grant the plaintiff parole.
69The reasons of the Parole Authority refer to this issue twice:
""It is further observed Corrections are considering a possible application for an extended order under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act.  Because of the limited time prior to the Offender being released whether on Parole or at the expiration of his Head Sentence the Authority urges such application be made, particularly when one considers the Offender is deemed a high risk and because of the statements he made during his sworn submissions."" (Reasons at p 4.7)
70The reference to ""statements he made during his sworn submissions"" can only be taken to be another reference to the mistaken understanding that the plaintiff said he did not want to undergo therapy or rehabilitation.
71The penultimate paragraph of the reasons included the second reference to this topic:
""There is little doubt there is concern that if the Offender was not Granted Parole the community would be placed in a position whereby a High Risk Sexual Offender would be released into the community without supervision and adversely affect the safety of the community.  Equally, the Authority is concerned that if Parole was Granted this day the Offender would also be a danger to the community and adversely impact the safety of the community.  Parliament has passed legislation that goes someway to alleviating situations such as that found in respect of the Offender and the Authority has already expressed its view respecting such.""  (Reasons p 5.4)
72The submissions for the Attorney General were that the reference to the possibility of an extended supervision order being made was not material to the Parole Authority's determination.  It should be characterised as something that was observed but did not contribute to the decision made.  The key issue underlying the decision was the protection of the safety of the community as at July 2013.  What the situation might be at the end of the plaintiff's sentence in a year's time, and whether or not he may be made the subject of an extended supervision order was accepted to be irrelevant to that key issue.  I asked counsel why, then, did the matter warrant mention in the reasons at all (let alone twice), to which there was the reply:  ""I don't know why the authority felt the need to mention it ... because that is not something for which they needed to consider themselves"". 
73In my view it seems more likely that the Parole Authority was primarily concerned about community safety and was making incidental observations in that context.  There is nothing wrong with a suggestion being made that consideration ought be given to an application under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act in relation to an offender who presents a significant risk of further sexual or violent offending (albeit a consideration in this case that was influenced by an erroneous finding).  I do not accept that this topic was a material consideration in the decision to refuse parole.  
Conclusion
74I have found in favour of the plaintiff in relation to the error of the Parole Authority in mistakenly finding that the plaintiff was unwilling to undergo therapy and rehabilitation. Further, that this finding was not put to the plaintiff at the hearing which constituted a denial of procedural fairness. 
75It was conceded by counsel for the Attorney General that if any of the grounds were made good the Court should not exercise its discretion to refrain from making the orders sought.  
Orders
76I make the following orders:
1. An order in the nature of certiorari, pursuant to the terms of s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970, quashing the decision of the State Parole Authority made on 2 July 2013 in relation to Warwick Boatswain. 2. An order, in the nature of mandamus, pursuant to the terms of s 65 and s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970, that the State Parole Authority convene and fulfil its public duty by determining the application for parole by Warwick Boatswain in accordance with law.
3. The second defendant is to pay the costs of the plaintiff as agreed or assessed.

2763794,R v Reitberger [2014] NSWDC 154,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: In this matter the complainant in the sexual assault trial was a patient of the accused who at the time was a medical practitioner in a practice at Burwood. The complainant had apparently seen the accused some years before but the consultation on 13 June 2012 was entirely coincidental. The complainant alleges that at this visit the accused masturbated him, rubbed his perineum and anal area and inserted his finger in his anus. The accused is charged with two counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse without consent. 

2Whilst there is no dispute that the complainant had a consultation with the accused on the day in question, the assaults are denied and the significant issue in the case as I understand it is going to be whether or not what occurred to the complainant was as a result of an examination for a proper medical purpose. 

3Apart from the alleged admissions made by the accused to the complainant in a lawfully recorded telephone conversation, the only evidence in the Crown case is the complainant's own evidence and evidence of early complaint to a number of other people. 

4The defence seeks to have the telephone conversations excluded from the jury. I will refer to these what have been called ""pretext"" conversations as call 1 and call 2. Call 1 was made on 2 November 2012 at about 1.30pm and lasted about four and a half minutes. Call 2 was made on the same day at 1.55pm and is somewhat longer. Both were recorded and the transcripts are available. 

5Mr Strickland SC for the defence seeks to have these conversations excluded under the provisions of either s 90 or s 137 and 138 of the Evidence Act. ""Pretext"" conversations have been considered by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in two relatively recent decisions Pavitt v R [2007] NSWCCA 88, (which was followed in the Victorian case of WK v R [2011] VSCA 345) and R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335. Mr Strickland has made detailed oral and written submissions arguing amongst other things that Pavitt and Burton wrongly applied a test initially set out by the Canadian Supreme Court in Broyles case. 

6In the present case the complainant formally complained to the HCCC in the first instance, although he had complained earlier to his sister and some other organisations. This HCCC complaint was by way of a written letter about what had happened, which was then followed by a formal statement, much akin to a police statement. The HCCC notified police who contacted the complainant and obtained a further statement, which basically confirmed the statement he'd made to the HCCC. The complainant's written letter was received by the HCCC on 19 June and the formal statement taken by the HCCC is dated 28 June. The police statement was made on 15 August, so that as far as the complete details of the matters complained of, they were in writing within three weeks of the alleged offences being committed. 

7According to the complainant who has given evidence on the voir dire, the HCCC told him that police might be able to use other investigative techniques like making contact with the accused, something that presumably the HCCC did not feel that they were able to do. The complainant was overseas when initially contacted by police. Some time prior to 2 November 2012 and after he had made his statement, Detective Senior Constable Page, the officer in charge, asked the complainant if he would be prepared to either telephone the accused or wear a body wire to a meeting with the accused.

8The complainant agreed to that proposal and an application was then made for a warrant under the Surveillance Devices Act to record any such telephone conversation and that warrant was granted. 

9Preparatory to making the calls the complainant made two pages of notes at home, that he no longer has, in order to assist him during the call. He was not told what questions to ask nor was he given a checklist or a script to follow by the police. Nor was he told that he should tell the truth, not ask leading questions or not make inducements to the accused. The calls were made from the Burwood Police Station with the complainant alone in the room and not able to be influenced by anyone else. 

10After the first call was made the complainant signalled that the call was over and Detective Page entered the room. They both listened to what had been said during the recording. According to the complainant Detective Page was happy with the call but asked the complainant if he would be prepared to ring the accused again in circumstances where the complainant was urged not to worry about the accused becoming suspicious of the purpose of the call. 

11The first call had ended with the accused inviting the complainant to ring again if he wanted to talk to him rather than coming to see him. He, the accused, had in fact supplied the complainant with his mobile number during that first conversation.

12About 20 minutes after the first call Detective Senior Constable Page left the room and the complainant made the second and longer call. Detective Senior Constable Page acknowledged that from his point of view, certainly at the time when he was asked questions during the voir dire, he wanted to get further evidence of the allegation that the accused had penetrated the complainant's anus with his finger.

13I am satisfied that the police did nothing to influence the course of either conversation other than to encourage discussion on the matters in issue. Detective Senior Constable Page acknowledged that prior to these calls he had enough evidence to charge the accused and arrest him, at which point of course he would have been obliged to issue a caution. But he wanted to see if he could obtain some admissions as to the conduct in question. He instructed the HCCC not to approach the accused as it might prejudice police investigations and alert the accused about things such as phone calls being attempted. He agreed that he did this to circumvent the requirement for a caution which would be required if the accused was arrested. He said he used the complainant as an investigative tool. At p 13 of the transcript he also acknowledged that this was to circumvent the requirement that if a police officer were to speak to the accused he would have had to have cautioned him. 

14What was said by the accused in the first call could be regarded as equivocal and may not have amounted to an admission as to the digital anal penetration, although that is really a matter of fact. The second call did provide evidence of the penetration, although again in circumstances that, it could be argued, did not necessarily involve criminal conduct on the part of the accused.

15The complainant was, as he said and understandably, very nervous prior to and during these calls. He admitted that certain things that he said to the accused were not the truth such as:- that he had not told anyone else about what had occurred; that he only wanted to talk about what had occurred with the accused; and that he would be more flattered if the reason for the conduct of the accused was the accused's attraction for the complainant. However in the second conversation at p 12 of the transcript he acknowledged to the accused that although he said he was flattered he actually was not and he had only said in the first conversation because he was nervous. 

16The defence argues that statements like this amounted to misrepresentations. It is further argued that the complainant saying things like, ""If you admit you did wrong I would feel more comfortable"" or, ""I prefer you just to be real with me then I'd feel better"" were inducements. . Of course misrepresentations and inducements would tend to invalidate anything said to police under caution in a record of interview. 

17Looking at the various authorities, both Australian and overseas, there are a wide variety of different scenarios involving so called ""pretext"" or ""entrapment"" conversations and depending upon the nature of the conversation and the persons having it, different considerations may well apply in each circumstance. In some instances the police officer has been or a police officer has been the undercover instigator of the conversation. In others a friend or an acquaintance of an accused has been used by the police to instigate a conversation. In the cases of Pavitt and Burton the victim was used by police to instigate the conversations. I am aware of victims of their own volition illegally recording conversations with alleged perpetrators in order to be able to present that material to the authorities.

18In Pavitt McColl JA and Latham J said at paras 71, 72 and 73 as follows:

""We would add that views may differ about whether a complainant is a state agent even if the conversation is recorded in circumstances facilitated by the police. [I omit a reference to a case there] For our part we would not readily apply a label of state agent to a complainant speaking to a suspect who had not been charged nor refused to speak to police. Rather we would look at the whole relationship as revealed by the participant's past history and what is revealed by the actual conversation. It maybe relevant to consider whether the police scripted the conversation. 



Further whilst Iacobucci J [who was one of the judges in the Broyle's case [1991] 3 SCR 595] did not see it as necessary to recognise a special test for cases involving a victim speaking to the accused. In our opinion, with respect, it might be thought that conversations in such circumstances were more likely to be reliable as the suspect would have no occasion to boast, seek to big note him or herself and to the extent the victim put allegations that the suspect had committed a criminal act vis a vis him or her the subject would more readily reject the proposition if it was false. Police could not anticipate that a suspect would readily make admissions to a person asserting he had committed a criminal act against him.As Giles J A said in EM v R, ""Ordinarily persons do not make admissions against interests unless they're true"".""


19Those words do not, it seems to me to raise a complainant in a sexual assault case to some sort of special category of persons who can never be agents of the state. In any particular case it will no doubt depend upon the circumstances of each matter. 

20In most sexual assault cases the issue usually comes down to one person's word against another's.It is rare for there to be any eye witnesses other than the parties concerned. Corroboration of a victim's version is not legally a necessity, but a jury is warned to scrutinise a victim's evidence carefully if it's the only evidence against an accused person. Whilst complaint evidence can amount to corroboration, it has its own problems. It seems to me that it cannot be the case that police investigation of sexual assault must come to a halt once a complainant has made a statement confirming criminal conduct. Indeed once a person is arrested or charged, given the uncertainly of conviction beyond reasonable doubt where it's one person's word against another's, I do not see it as inappropriate for police to seek to obtain an admission using a victim as a means to an end, provided the police act appropriately. 

21In the present case, the accused at the time was a medical practitioner of some lengthy experience. The complainant was a young man, aged twenty-three. He was seeing the doctor about a possible urinary tract infection, he then being in a relationship with a same sex partner. There was thus a well experienced doctor and a relatively vulnerable patient, confronting each other. It seems to me it cannot be suggested that the complainant was in a position of emotional or subjective superiority in relation to the accused, or that he was in a position to exploit the accused in some way, either then or at the time of the telephone call. 

22There was no apparent unease on the part of the accused during the conversation. He could have ended it at any time by saying something like, ""Look I don't know what you're talking about."" It's suggested that the accused was vulnerable because he was confronted with an emotional patient who needed reassurance and hence, some of the ambivalent responses by the accused to the questions and statements that were being made. 

23I don't accept that the conversation was scripted in any way or influenced, prejudicially to the accused, by the police. I do accept that the conversation would probably not have occurred but for the police requesting that process to be undertaken and the conversations were certainly not part of any sort of ongoing relationship between the complainant and the accused as appears have been the case to some degree, in Pavitt but certainly in Burton. No doubt, there was concern as to the bizarre nature of the allegations, in the circumstances, against a medical practitioner and that it was important to get as much evidence as possible to support the complainant's version of events. 

24If ""pretext"" conversations are to be regarded as lawful and admissible, depending on the circumstances, I cannot see that police officers would be required, especially in the case of a sexual assault complainant, to discuss with that complainant what is meant by a misrepresentation, leading questions or inducements. To do so would, it seems to me, to engage in an artificiality that the cases seem to suggest is to be avoided. A spontaneous conversation with whatever faults it may have, is likely to be more believable than an artificial one. Clearly, there would be little purpose in such conversations if subterfuge, to some degree, was not part of the equation, provided that the subterfuge does not go to the core of the evidentiary benefit sought to be obtained.

25For example, in the present case, if admissions had been made consequent upon the complainant telling the accused, untruthfully, that he had aurally recorded what had happened to him on his mobile phone, that may be a situation warranting exclusion. But the matters complained of as being misrepresentations or lies or untruths, did not in my view make any difference to how the conversation developed or as to how any admissions were made.

26The accused was told on 8 November 2012, that an allegation had been made against him, by someone, of a sexual nature and he agreed to meet with police at the police station, on 15 November. On that date, when interviewed, he was not under arrest. He was given the usual caution at the interview and told he could leave at any time. He agreed to the interview even though he did not have a lawyer present. During the interview, he was asked questions about the conversations that he had with the complainant on 2 November. 

27The later history of the matter is that on 28 November, he was given a court attendance notice to attend court on 9 January and the matter has taken its course since then.

28The accused has not called or given evidence on this application, but reliance is placed on what he said in the record of interview by way of explanation as to what was said to him in the two conversations and as to how the accused reacted to that situation and the questions that were being asked. 

29In R v Swaffield: Pavic v R 192 CLR 159, which I will refer to as Swaffield and Pavic, in the joint judgment at para 100, the following was said in conclusion in the Pavic case;

""No caution was administered by Clancy which is hardly surprising in the circumstances."" [Clancy being the person that the police had asked to speak with, the accused.] ""The circumstances are close to those in Broyles, the Canadian Decision. As in Broyles, the person with whom Pavic spoke must be regarded as an agent of the state. A meeting was not directly set up by the police, but Clancy spoke with Pavic at the request of the police, who equipped him with a recording device. If Broyles is applied, the next question is whether the admissions by Pavic were elicited by Clancy, were made in the course of a conversation. Put another way, was there an interrogation by Clancy. Pavic argued that he was misled by Clancy to making the admissions he did. The trial judge said ""whilst the role of the accused in the killing was volunteered by him to Clancy in a somewhat limited fashion, it cannot be said to be the result of or inexplicably linked to the expressed fear of Clancy that he may be charged with an offence"". In all the circumstances, where is no sufficient reason to interfere with the trial judges refusal to exclude the evidence of the conversation.""

30The Pavic appeal was dismissed.

31Whilst the Canadian cases are referred to in Swaffield, the principles enunciated , partly in Broyles case, are not specifically adopted. Brennan CJ did not refer to either of the Canadian cases.

32The plurality or joint judgment said at paragraphs 83 and subsequently as follows;

""The Canadian authorities are instructive in this regard, though it is necessary to keep in mind the existence of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and to identify the extent to which any authority turns on the language of the charter.""

33The Court then went to refer to the case of R v Hebert, which was the other case. It then went to consider R v Broyles. At paras 87 and 88, the judgement said of Broyles case;

""The Court identified two questions which are necessary for decision but which do not have to be answered in Hebert. The first was whether the friend was an agent of the state. The second was whether the accused's statement had been elicited by the friend.""

Then at para 89;

""The Australian decisions generally have not expressed the relevant principles by reference to the informed choice spoken of in Canadian cases. At least in terms of voluntariness, they tend to approach the matter in terms of an immunity from compulsion. The emphasis has been on whether duress has been brought to bear on the suspect, that is whether the will has been overborne in some way. That emphasis is well placed when voluntariness is at issue but it is too narrow when the exercise of discretion is involved.""

34Section 90 of the Evidence Act creates a test of unfairness to an accused in deciding whether or not evidence of admissions by the prosecution is to be admitted. In Swaffield, para 53, the Court said amongst other things;

""The term unfairness in this sense is concerned with the accused's right to a fair trial, a right which may be jeopardised if a statement is obtained in circumstances which affect the reliability of the statement. Unfairness then relates to the right of an accused to a fair trial. In that situation, the unfairness discretion overlaps with the power or discretion to reject evidence which is more prejudicial than probative, each looking to the risk that an accused may be improperly convicted. While unreliability may be a touchstone of unfairness, it has been said not to be the sole touchstone. It may be for instance that no confession might have been made at all had the police investigation been properly conducted. Once considerations other than unreliability are introduced, the line between unfairness and policy may become blurred.""


35In determining unfairness then, the Court is required to consider a confession's reliability and or whether it's prejudicial value is unfairly greater than it's probative value, bearing in mind that admissions will always be prejudicial to an accused.

36The Court may also need to look at policy considerations even where no unfairness has been demonstrated, particularly if it established no confession might have been made if the investigation had been properly conducted. That is a reference there to Duke (1989) CLR 508 at 513. 

37Section 98 of the Evidence Act is the coincidence evidence section and it restricts the use of coincidence evidence to cases where the probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect. Section 137 is an overarching restriction on evidence being admitted if is probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to an accused. The so-called balancing test as to whether a jury will unfairly use the evidence in a way other than what it was intended to prove. Section 138 excludes evidence obtained in consequence of an impropriety unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which it was obtained. This is essentially a public policy rule.

38At the outset it is difficult in reading appellate cases, to get a flavour of the evidence sought to be excluded in each case. Thus comparing cases factually may be unhelpful in applying the ratio of a decided case to the case being tried in the matter before me. Much will depend upon the actual circumstances of each individual matter. The evidence on this application is a matter of record. It seems to me inappropriate to refer extensively to that material in a judgment on admissibility where the trial is now proceeding. Nor is it my role, it seems to me, to embark on a detail exegesis of the law on this topic which has occupied appellate courts to a significant degree. 

39The accused argues in regard to s 90 that unfairness is not a defined concept. Reference is made to the case of Duke v R, where amongst other things it was said that, trickery, misrepresentation, cross-examination going beyond the clarification of information voluntarily given, to name but some improprieties, may justify rejection of a confession if the impropriety has some material effect on the confessionalist, albeit the confession is unreliable and was apparently made in the exercise of a free choice to speak or be silent. 

40The Court went on to say the effect of the impropriety in procuring the confession must be evaluated in all the circumstances of the case. The first consideration it is argued, is a denial of important procedural rights which an accused possesses. The second consideration is the reliability or lack thereof of the admission. The other issue is the accused's freedom to choose to speak or not to speak to the police. 

41It is argued that when an accused is interviewed by the police he has certain rights. The most important of those rights is the right to silence. It is also the right, when arrested, to be informed of the nature of the charges the police are investigating. Covert recordings deny the procedural right of (a) the accused choosing whether to speak to the police and (b) the accused knowing that he is under investigation for a particular charge. 

42Considerable reliance is placed on Broyles case by the defence which, it suggested, is authority for a number of propositions. They have been set out in the helpful submissions from Mr Strickland. They are, essentially:- 

(1)Would the exchange between the accused and the informer have taken place in the form and manner in which it did take place, but for the intervention of the state or its agents. 

(2)Did the state agent actively seek out information such that the exchange could be characterised as akin to interrogation or did he or she conduct his or her part in the conversation as someone in the role the accused believed the informant to be playing would ordinarily have done. 

(3)It is the authorities who are in a position to control the actions of the informer. If they fail to do so, they ought not benefit from that failure at the expense of the accused. 

43It is quite clear, and this is argued in Pavic, that the High Court certainly regarded the informer as an agent of the state and certainly regarded that whatever was said by Mr Pavic was elicited in that the accused was interrogated by the informer. Whether that amounts to an adoption of the principles in Broyle's is perhaps a matter for another time.

44Reference was then made to the case of Burton, particularly to Justice Simpson (who gave the Court's judgment) at paras (124) and (127) where her Honour found the complainant was not an agent of the State because she was satisfied the conversation would have occurred anyhow and that the admissions made were not elicited because the conversation was not a functional interrogation. 

45Burton is substantially factually different to the present case for the reasons I have already stated. That is that the conversations in the case before me would not have happened but for police intervention and secondly there was no suggestion of any ongoing relationship that would be of any relevance. 

46In Pavitt the factual circumstances were somewhat more akin to the present case except that the time delay between the offences and the telephone call were some 16 or 17 years as opposed to four months in the present case. As well the police sat in on the conversation with the complainant and even suggested questions to the complainant by way of giving notes to the complainant. Pavitt had apparently been a neighbour of the complainant when the latter was a young man and sexually assaulted him between 1983 and 1987. The complainant contacted police in 2002 and the impugned telephone calls occurred in 2003. 

47In Pavitt McColl J A and Latham J set out in para (70) some of the considerations to be taken into account in this type of evidence. The first 

(a)is that the underlying consideration in the admissibility of covertly recorded conversations is looking at the accused's freedom to choose to speak o the police and the extent to which that freedom has been impugned. 

(b)If that freedom is impugned the Court has a discretion to reject the evidence, the exercise of which will turn on all the circumstances which may point to unfairness to the accused if the confession is admitted. A conclusion that some or all of the Broyle's factors were present did not lead to the admissions being excluded in either Pavic or Carter's cases. 

(c) Even if there is no unfairness the Court may consider that having regard to the means by which the confession was elicited, the evidence has been obtained at a price which is unacceptable and in regard to prevailing community standards which is the public police issue. 

(d)The question whether the conversation was recorded in circumstances such that it might be characterised as either unfair and or improper include whether the accused had previously indicated that he or she had refused to speak to the police.

48I interpolate here that there is no dispute that prior to this telephone conversation no-one had approached the accused or warned him in anyway that there was any ongoing investigation. But I think the point about what the Court says in (d) is that if a person has been approached by either the police or someone else and said they do not want to speak to the police than that is a fairly significant matter to be taken into account. In this case it is neutral because the approach was not made.

(e)The right to silence will only be infringed where it was the informant who caused the accused to make the statement and where the informer was acting as an agent of the state at the time the accused made the statement. Accordingly two distinct inquiries are required:-. 

1. as a threshold question was the evidence obtained by an agent of the state.

2. was the evidence elicited

(f) A person is a state agent if the exchange between the accused and the informer would not have taken place in the form and manner in which it did take place but for the intervention of the state or its agents. 

(g)Absent eliciting behaviour on the part of the police, there is no violation of the accused's right to choose whether or not to speak to the police. If the suspect speaks it is by his or her own choice and he or she must be taken to have accepted the risk that the recipient may inform the police. 

(h)Admissions will have been elicited if the relevant parts of the conversation were the functional equivalent of an interrogation and if the state agent exploited any special characteristics of the relationship to extract the statement. Evidence of the instructions given to the state agent for the conduct of the conversation may also be important. 

(i) The fact the conversation was covertly recorded is not of itself unfair or improper at least where the recording was lawful. 

49This passage in Pavitt was followed in Burton and in WK v R, albeit the factual circumstances on both those cases were different. 

50It is argued that any admissions obtained were elicited because (a) the complainant actively sought to get critical information. (b) The complainant engaged in deception or misrepresentations. (c) The complainant initiated all relevant parts of the conversations and (d) asked leading questions. It is argued that the police should have controlled the complainant better and told him the manner in which it was permissible and impermissible to ask questions and have discussions with the accused. In my view those submissions are misplaced. 

51In regard to what was said in the subject conversations I would adopt some of the remarks made by the majority in Pavitt at paras (74) and following, particularly the following matters. 

The conversation was recorded legally pursuant to a warrant. The accused had not declined to be interviewed by the police and he took the risk when he continued the conversation with the complainant once it turned to questions of what they had done that the complainant might speak to the police. There was nothing in the circumstances in which the conversation occurred which indicates that the accused's statements were unreliable. He could have withdrawn from it at anytime. In fact he invited the complainant to speak to him again and provided the complainant with his mobile telephone number.


Looking merely at the relationship between the complainant and the police he was their agent because the conversation would not have taken place as it did. That is the conversation would most probably not have been recorded if the police had not obtained a warrant and arranged for the complainant to participate in it. However, if the complainant was a state agent in my view he did not exploit any special characteristic of his relationship with the appellant.""


I cannot discern any inequality in the conversation. Nor would I conclude any parts of the conversation were the functional equivalent of an interrogation. The complainant had clearly formulated ideas of what he wanted to say to the accused during the conversation and the evidence does not support the proposition that the police scripted how the conversations unfolded. 

52If the first call suffered from a deficiency of perhaps surprise, the second did not, given that the complainant had been invited by the accused to contact him again to talk about how the complainant was feeling. I do not agree that Pavitt mis-states the test in Broyles. Whilst Pavitt was a majority decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, it has been unanimously confirmed in Burton and also in the Victorian case of WK. The Broyles decision, standing alone, is not the law in Australia, having regard to what the High Court said in Swaffield & Pavic. If Pavitt has misstated the Broyles test then what was said in Pavitt is in any event a precedent I am required to follow. 

53Reference was made in the submissions to a case of Juric (2002) 199 ACrimR 408, another Victorian Supreme Court of Appeal decision. I do not see anything in that case that has a direct bearing on the matter before me. 

54It is my view that sexual assault complainants ought be regarded as being in at least a different category of so-called state agents in that, the police or the other agents employed by them are not usually directly involved in the alleged criminal conduct itself whereas a complainant is. 

55In the present case the police had a complaint from a young man against a medical practitioner of long standing. The complaint was about what had happened on a single isolated visit. I can understand police would wish to obtain as much evidence as possible before embarking on the charge process. The fact that Senior Constable Page used the complainant as an investigatory tool, realising that this meant the accused would not be cautioned, as would be required if he spoke to the accused, seems to basically state the obvious in regard to ""pretext"" calls generally. To suggest, really that pretext calls must be accompanied by a warning or the giving of information to the accused as to the purpose of the call would render such calls, in my view, completely worthless. If there is a public policy issue needing to address this particular problem, that is a matter for the parliament because at this point of time, New South Wales' highest criminal court has not said that such calls are inherently unfair and ought be excluded from a criminal trial for any public policy reason. 

56Obviously, a lot depends upon the circumstances in each particular case. With a complainant though, there is a substantial difference it seems to me, between such a person confronting their alleged abuser as opposed to someone totally unassociated with the alleged events, especially in circumstances where, as I find here, the resulting conversation was unscripted, undirected and unassisted by any police officers except in regard to the general topic and providing the means to make the call. It would have been quite different, for example, if Senior Constable Page had sought to impersonate the complainant over the phone to the accused. 

57Reference was made to the New South Wales Police Code of Practice for Crime, but that talks about the responsibilities of police once police believe they have sufficient evidence to establish that an accused has committed the offence, which is the subject then of the questioning being carried out. 

58I do not agree that the Hight Court in Swaffield & Pavic set out a formula for determining who is a state agent that necessarily applies to the present case. In Pavic, apparently Pavic gave evidence to the effect that he was misled by the informer into making the admissions that he made. The High Court agreed with the trial judge that in any event, those admissions were not linked to any fears of being charged with an offence. 

59The word ""eliciting"", as has been applied in this context, seems to have developed a legal meaning far beyond its grammatical one and seems to relate to information obtained as a result of a formulaic interview. I do not see these conversations as exhibiting evidence of elicitation, as that expression is understood. Further I am well satisfied that the lies or misrepresentations or subterfuges engaged in by the complainant had no effect on any admissions said to have been made by the accused. 

60It is argued that the accused was vulnerable with or felt obligated to the complainant and that caused him to say what he said. That submission is based on what the accused said to police in his record of interview in regard to these conversations. It is also said, without evidence to support the assertion, the accused was manipulated or induced into making the admissions he made by some of the misrepresentations uttered by the complainant that I have previously referred to. 

61I find that submission difficult to comprehend. It is suggested that the accused went along with the complainant's assertions to ""calm him down"" and as it were, to continue the accused's ""duty of ongoing pastoral care"" for his patient. If that is indeed the case, I would have expected that there would have been evidence of that on the application. Absent that evidence, I find it difficult to see in this day and age, that a doctor, confronted with a patient complaining of a sexual incident between them, would basically agree with what the patient said had happened because that seemed to be in the patient's best interests at the time. 

62The defence has also argued that the conversations should be excluded for policy considerations and the unreliability of the admissions. Much of the arguments under these headings overlap with other submissions. However one aspect of the public policy argument relates to the suggested misuse by police of the provisions of the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 to investigate matters such as the present alleged sexual assault and obtain covert evidence of telephone conversations. 

63I was handed a decision by Judge Colefax of this Court where he expressed concern about that situation, and that is R v LDV(No 2) [2013] NSWDC 215. Ultimately the pretext conversations in that case, as I understand it, were disallowed because requirements of the legislation had not been complied with. I do not propose to go into this area except to observe that prior to the Surveillance Devices Act 2007, there was other much older legislation such as the Listening Devices Act 1984 which, when enacted, did not have terrorism or national security in mind but tried to cover the field of unlawfully recorded telephone conversations. It is a matter for the legislature to deal with unexpected uses or abuses of its legislation, not for the Courts, if the conduct is otherwise lawful. It is not being argued that the warrants in the present case were obtained unlawfully. 

64As to the unreliability of these conversations, nothing has been demonstrated to me that the accused's right to a fair trial has been jeopardised by any statements made by him that have been obtained in circumstances such that those circumstances were likely to have affected the reliability of what was said. I see no evidence that the complainant overbore the accused or misled the accused in such a way that it affected what the accused was saying. I am prepared to accept that initially the accused may not have been able to identify who the complainant was, but that factor can hardly have effected what he later said. Similarly, the fact that the accused may not have had access to his medical records is neither here nor there. Despite that lack of having a record, the accused was prepared and able to continue the conversation, which ensued. In any event, having the medical record (exhibit H on the voir dire) it seems to me is unlikely to have provided him with much assistance in being able to identify the complainant. 

65Many of the criticisms levelled at the way the conversations developed, could easily have been answered by the accused saying, for example, 'Look I'll have to get my records out and ring you back' or 'Look I'm in the middle of moving house can you ring back'. That did not happen. However, in his record of interview at QA 171, the accused said, ""And I thought look I don't know this fellow. I can't remember him. I'm busy at the moment. I'll play along with basically what he wants to hear almost.""

66Before leaving this general area, I was referred to the two cases of DJS v R; NS v R (2012) NSWCCA 9 and R v XY (2013) NSWCCA 121. Both of those cases relate to whether or not a court could take into account whether there was a real possibility of alternative explanations inconsistent with guilt in determining the probative value of evidence led or proposed to be led under s 98 of the Evidence Act.

67The ratio of the cases is succinctly stated by Bathurst CJ in the first of those matters, DJS at paras 9 and 10 where he adopted what Whealy JA had said at para 79 to 81. The Chief Justice said;

""The matters to which the Court is to have regard in performing this task is the evidence sought to be adduced either on its own or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to tender it. It is no part of the Court's task to engage in a fact finding exercise to determine the reliability of credibility of the evidence or to form a view one way or the other, whether the jury would in fact find the evidence to be of significant probative value. The trial judge, in forming a view as to whether the evidence has significant probative value must consider by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party tendering it, whether there is a real possibility if an alternative explanation inconsistent with the guilt of the party of the party against whom it is tendered. This is because the availability of such an alternative hypothesis will be relevant to forming the view required by the section that the evidence has significant probative value. However this does not involve either undertaking the fact finding analysis suggested by counsel or reaching a conclusion that the explanation for the coincidence proffered by the parties seeking to tender the evidence was more probable than an alternative hypothesis. Each of these approaches go beyond what is required by the terms of s 98(1)(b) and would involve the judge usurping the fact finding role of the jury.""


68I accept that this is the law in New South Wales. However, I have difficulty in seeing how either of these cases has relevance to the task that I am undertaking on this application. The s98 considerations are different and the testing is made in light of evidence to be adduced in a trial or that has already been adduced, so that the Court can properly assess the probative value of the evidence of itself or by reference to other evidence. The only evidence I have is the conversations, the complainant's evidence, Senior Constable Page's evidence and the untested material in the accused's record of interview. I do not in fact have any evidence of alternative explanations. As Simpson J said in Burton at paragraph 181;

""It does not necessarily follow that the identical approach as set out in DJS, must be taken with respect to contentious evidence where objection is taken under s 137. The two provisions have marked differences.""

Further, at para 196 after referring to XY, her Honour said;

""The existence of competing inferences does not have any part to play in the s 137 considerations.""

69For the above reasons, I am not satisfied that it has been established under s 90 that, having regard to the circumstances of the telephone calls, it would be unfair to the accused to use that evidence. 

70I am also not satisfied that, if s138 applies to this evidence, any false statement made by the complainant during the course of the calls were likely to cause the accused to make any relevant admission under s 138 (2)(b). I doubt that the complainant would be regarded as a person conducting the questioning as referred to in the subsection. 

71I was referred to a case of Employment Advocate v. Williamson, and in particular the judgment of Branson J reported at 2001 FCA 1164. The passage is at par 86 where her Honour says, 

""As is noted above, in my view, s138 of the Evidence Act does not qualify it by any requirement that the evidence be obtained by a law enforcement officer or by another holder of public office"".

72Whether Her Honour, with respect, is right about that I do not know because it was a minority judgment. But it seems to me that the conversation, as I understand the conversation in that particular case, was official questioning in the sense that it was questioning by people involved in the investigation of a particular matter, but one would not have regarded those persons carrying out the questioning as being law enforcement officers or holders of public office. In many respects I would not necessarily disagree with her Honour because it seems to me that subs (a) and (b) of subs (2) do not, with respect, make much grammatical sense anyway and especially so in the circumstances of the present case. As I have already indicated I do not accept that this conversation was some sort of formal or formulaic questioning by any person in authority. 

73In regard to s 137 the evidence is clearly extremely probative of a fact in issue and is clearly prejudicial to the accused. However, unfair prejudice is something more than what more than might be termed the ordinary prejudice that might flow from evidence tendered by the Crown that tends to inculpate an accused person. The prejudice to be avoided is prejudice arising from an application of that evidence in question in a way other than what the evidence was led for such that it creates an unfairness to an accused that maybe difficult or impossible to overcome, such as information that might be led for one purpose but the jury may use it improperly to come to a conclusion as to something else. Subject to appropriate directions I cannot see how this evidence might be used in an unfair way beyond the ordinary or natural prejudice that attracts to that evidence in any event. 

74For these reasons I dismiss the application to have the evidence of the two telephone calls excluded from the jury.

1R A HULME J: I agree with Davies J.
2DAVIES J: The Applicant stood trial before Judge Bozic and a jury on four counts as follows:
Count 1: Ongoing supply of a prohibited drug being heroin between 17 May 2011 and 8 June 2011;
Count 2: Supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin, on 18 May 2011;
Count 3: Supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin, on 3 June 2011; and
Count 4: Supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin, on 7 June 2011.
3The Applicant was found not guilty on counts 1 and 3 but guilty on counts 2 and 4.  
4The Applicant was sentenced by Judge Bozic on 22 July 2013 as follows:
Count 2: A non-parole period of 18 months commencing 22 July 2013 and expiring 21 January 2015 with an additional term of six months;
Count 4: A non-parole period of 18 months commencing 22 July 2013 and expiring 21 January 2015 with an additional term of six months;
5At the same time a co-offender, Wei Pan, was charged with the following matters:
Count 1: Supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin, on 4 May 2011; 
Count 2: Supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin, on 6 May 2011;
Count 3: Supply a prohibited drug (heroin) on an ongoing basis on six occasions between 11 May 2011 and 7 June 2011; and 
Count 4: Supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin, on 6 July 2011.
6The co-offender pleaded guilty to each of the four counts. The two offences in respect of which the Applicant was convicted were concerned with the same transactions as formed part of the ongoing supply by the co-offender.  
7On 1 March 2013 the co-offender was sentenced by Judge Bozic as follows:
Count 1: A non-parole period of ten months commencing 20 May 2012 and expiring 19 March 2013 with an additional term of one year and two months;
Count 2: A non-parole period of ten months commencing 20 May 2012 and expiring 19 March 2013 with an additional term of one year and two months;
Count 4: A non-parole period of ten months commencing 20 May 2012 and expiring 19 March 2013 with an additional term of one year and two months;
Count 3: A non-parole period of 15 months commencing 20 May 2012 and expiring 19 August 2013 with an additional term of one year and nine months.
8The overall effective sentence was a non-parole period of 15 months commencing 20 May 2012 with an additional term of one year and nine months.  All the sentences were subject to a 25 per cent discount for an early plea.  The notional starting point for counts 1, 2 and 4 was therefore 2.66 years and for count 3 was 4 years.
9The Applicant seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
Ground 1: The Sentencing Judge erred in determining that because this was a case of trafficking to a substantial degree less weight should be accorded to good character.
Ground 2: The individual sentences and the total sentence are manifestly excessive.
Ground 3: The Applicant has a justifiable sentence of grievance as a result of the sentences imposed on the co-offender Wei Pan.
Circumstances of the offending
10The Sentencing Judge determined the facts as a result of the jury's verdict and the following summary is taken from his Honour's determination.
11Prior to 18 May 2011 an undercover officer had a number of dealings with the co-offender Mr Wei Pan. Pursuant to a control authority the undercover officer had, on previous occasions, purchased heroin from the co-offender. 
12On 13 May 2011 the undercover officer had a conversation with Mr Pan and then further conversations on 16 May and 17 May 2011. In those conversations the undercover officer discussed with Mr Pan purchasing ""a ball"" of heroin. In evidence the undercover officer said that a ball of heroin was three and a half grams. A meeting was arranged for 11 am on Wednesday 18 May 2011. Prior to attending the meeting the undercover officer was fitted with a listening device and was given $2,200 in cash.
13The undercover officer attended a house in Matthes Street, Yennora.  In the presence of the undercover officer Mr Pan spoke with someone and an arrangement was made for the undercover officer to return later that day. The undercover officer left the premises and returned about an hour later. He rang the bell at a side gate and was met by Mr Pan. The two men then went to a garden shed which was in the backyard of the house. It had been converted into a room with a chair and a coffee table. 
14A short time later Mr Pan looked at his mobile phone and he and the undercover police officer then walked back to the front yard of the house. In the driveway of the house there was a black Honda. The Applicant was sitting in the driver's seat and she was the only person in the car. The undercover police officer stood at the front door of the car and had a conversation with Mr Pan and the Applicant. 
15The undercover officer gave $2,200 in cash to Mr Pan. The Applicant then took out a scrunched up tissue bag and opened it up. There were four knotted clear plastic bags, each containing a white substance. The Applicant handed the bags to Mr Pan who then handed them to the undercover officer. The undercover officer then left.   Subsequent analysis of the four clear bags show that they contained 3.39 grams of heroin with a purity of 70%.
16At about 6.46 pm on Monday 6 June 2011 the undercover officer rang Mr Pan. The undercover officer said that he needed ""another one"". Mr Pan suggested that he could meet with the undercover officer the next day but told the undercover officer to ring back in an hour. 
17The following day, 7 June 2011, the undercover officer rang Mr Pan and had a conversation with him. At about 7.24 pm the undercover officer drove to the house in Matthes Street, Yennora.  The officer walked to the gate of the house, pressed the bell and a short time later Mr Pan walked from the backyard to the gate. Mr Pan opened the gate and the two men then walked to the shed in the backyard. Mr Pan's wife was in the shed. 
18At about 7.55pm Mr Pan received a phone call.  He then left the shed and subsequently returned to the shed with the Applicant.  The Applicant came into the shed.  The undercover officer took out money totalling $2,000 and handed the money to the Applicant.  The Applicant then handed to the undercover officer a scrunched tissue bag containing four small knotted plastic bags with a white substance.  The undercover officer took the bags and left.  Subsequent analysis of the four clear bags showed that they contained 3.41 grams of heroin with a purity of 70%.
19On 18 May the $2,200 was handed to Mr Pan by the undercover officer. There was no direct evidence that the money was handed on to the Applicant.  The Sentencing Judge said that it was clear, however, that the Applicant would not have passed over the packages of heroin unless there was an understanding with Mr Pan that either the money was ultimately to be handed over to the Applicant or that Mr Pan would pass the money on to the relevant third party.  
20On 7 June 2011 the Applicant received the $2,000 herself.  On the question of how much money the Applicant received from the two suppliers, the Applicant gave evidence at the sentence hearing that she received $60 for each supply.
21A listening device recording made on 18 May 2011 captured an exchange in which Mr Pan and the Applicant were recorded as saying the following: 
The Applicant (in Mandarin): I just assist other people. 
Mr Pan: She don't make, she only make every time, see every time she run to me, make $50.  
The Applicant: Maximum of 60 and that's it.

Subjective factors
22The Applicant was aged 43 years at the date of sentence.  She grew up in Vietnam and migrated to Australia when she was 21.  She had lost her parents at a young age and thereafter lived with her older sister and brother until she left Vietnam.  
23After she came to Australia she worked in the retail industry for ten years, ceasing work after the birth of her youngest child.  She had three children to her partner of 15 years and a 21 year old child from a previous marriage.  
24The Applicant told the case manager from the Probation and Parole service that she suffered from depression.  She had not, however, sought any professional treatment to address mental health concerns.  However, when she saw a psychologist, Ms Pamela Costantini, she said that she was not depressed and not anxious and had never taken medication to treat depression or anxiety or sleep problems.
25Ms Costantini noted the Applicant's low level of education and her ongoing difficulties with speaking and understanding English.  The Sentencing Judge rejected Ms Costantini's opinion that the Applicant's low level of education might have meant that she did not fully grasp the serious implications of her involvement in the matters that led to her being charged.  
26The Applicant had no criminal record.
Ground 1:  Drug trafficking and good character
27The Sentencing Judge said this:
The offender has no prior criminal history.  As a first time offender she is entitled to leniency although if this is a case of trafficking to a substantial degree, a question with which I will deal shortly, less weight is accorded to good character.
28The Sentencing Judge found that the Applicant was involved in trafficking to a substantial degree.  He said that the supplies of heroin on each of the two occasions were not isolated incidents.  The Applicant was part of some form of organisation where an order was placed with a co-offender, the order was conveyed to the Applicant who then obtained the drugs from a third party in order to fill the order and then provided it in person to the co-offender to supply to the ultimate purchaser.  
29The Applicant in her written submissions on the appeal did not take issue with the finding that she was involved in trafficking to a substantial degree.  30The Applicant's counsel drew attention to the categories of offences referred to in Athos v R [2013] NSWCCA 205 at [36] where it was held that limited weight may be given to good character.  Two of the groups listed that appeared to be relevant were drug couriers and federal drug importation offences.  It was submitted that the Applicant fell into neither of those groups.  
31Attention was further directed to what Price J (Beazley P and Johnson J agreeing) discussed at [38]-[45], highlighting that good character placed the offender in a position where he or she was more likely to be selected to become involved in an offence.  That picked up a similar discussion in R v Leroy (1984) 13 A Crim R 469 and Brent Redfern v R [2012] NSWCCA 178 at [23].  In the last mentioned case Adams J (McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreeing) said at [24]:
There is no special class of offence, including drug dealing, which requires a different rule to be applied to the significance of the particular subjective circumstances in an individual case.  
32Nothing in the Remarks on Sentence in the present case suggests that no weight was given to the fact that the Applicant was a first time offender nor that she was not accorded some leniency for that fact.  
33As the ground of appeal makes clear, the complaint is one that less weight was accorded to one factor by the Sentencing Judge.  The issue of what weight is to be given to factors is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the Sentencing Judge:  R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11].  The Sentencing Judge's statement that less weight is accorded to good character in relation to offences involving drug supply is well supported by authority.  There is a variety of reasons for that approach including the importance of both general deterrence as well as planning in drug supply cases:  Van Can Ha [2008] NSWCCA 141 at [43]; Sinkovich v R [2011] NSWCCA 90 at [53].
34This ground fails.
Ground 2: Sentences manifestly excessive
35The Applicant submitted that a sentence of two years imprisonment for supplying 3.39g and 3.41g of heroin in circumstances where the Applicant was said to receive only $60 from each supply, was found to be a street level supplier and had no criminal record was a manifestly excessive sentence.  It was accepted that a period of full time imprisonment was likely to be inevitable but it was submitted that it ought to have been measured in months rather than years.
36However, the Sentencing Judge found that the Applicant was involved in trafficking to a substantial degree, that the two supplies in respect of which she was convicted were not isolated and that she was clearly part of some form of organisation.  This organisation involved the Applicant's being rung by the co-offender or his wife, followed by the Applicant's driving to their house with the heroin and receiving money, most of which would be passed on to some unknown third person.  
37Two other matters are of importance in considering whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.  The first is that the offences were committed for financial gain, the second is that the purity of the drugs was 70%.  Both are matters which elevate the seriousness of the offences.  The fact that the individual supplies were of relatively small weight does not remove the substantial need for deterrence:  Restuccia v R [2012] NSWCCA 15 at [14].
38This ground fails.
Ground 3: Parity
39The Crown had submitted that the role of the Applicant was higher than that of the co-offender because she was not a street dealer.  His Honour was not able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant's role was in substance greater than that of the co-offender.  
40There were both similarities and differences between the two offenders:
(1) The co-offender was a user/addict which the Sentencing Judge said placed him in the lower range of criminality than a drug trafficker motivated purely by greed.  
(2)The co-offender pleaded guilty to more offences than the two in respect of which the jury found the Applicant guilty.  The Applicant received a 25% discount for her early offer to plead to the two offences in respect of which she was found guilty.
(3)The Sentencing Judge found that the co-offender was genuinely remorseful but found that the Applicant was not genuinely remorseful for her actions as opposed to remorse for her predicament and the effect that it had on her family.  
(4)The co-offender suffered from depression and anxiety in the severe range.
(5)The Sentencing Judge found that the co-offender had made progress with his attempt to address his problems and that if he maintained that motivation he would have good prospects of rehabilitation.  
(6)As with the Applicant, the Sentencing Judge was unable to conclude that he was unlikely to re-offend.  
(7)The co-offender had a large number of offences on his record whereas the Applicant had none.  
(8)The co-offender was on conditional liberty at the time of his offending.
41In considering the issue of parity two things are important.  The first is that it was the same judge who sentenced both offenders and he expressly made reference to the issue of parity between the Applicant and the co-offender.  He concluded:
Given the differences between the offender and Mr Pan, both in a favourable and in an unfavourable sense to this offender, I determine the sentences to be imposed on the offender with only limited regard to the sentences imposed on Mr Pan.  
42It has been said in many cases that this Court will be cautious before determining that one co-offender has a justifiable sense of grievance because of different sentencing outcomes where the same judge has sentenced each and has had regard to the differing criminality and the different subjective circumstances of each:  R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71] per Barr and Howie JJ.  The various authorities are gathered in Loader v R; Dunn v R [2013] NSWCCA 215 at [91]-[96].
43The second matter of significance is that counsel for the Applicant submitted to the Sentencing Judge that parity did not apply.  He said:
Well I would submit that there's differences and significant differences so as not to enliven that principle.  Where there are differences in culpability or circumstances then obviously due allowance must made (sic) for those differences.  Now here I would respectfully submit that obviously parity does not apply as Mr Pan pleaded guilty to ongoing supply, a significant difference and then to three other charges of supply.  Further and also extremely significant as to whether Wei should be treated as like, now in my submission they are not alike. ... so I would respectfully submit that the Court your Honour would treat the cases entirely differently.
HIS HONOUR:  Meaning that one concludes there's just not a relevant parity issue here?
HARRISON: In my submission there's not ... 
44In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [81] Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said:
[81] The Victorian Court of Appeal has emphasised recently, that in sentencing appeals, the Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment and not rehearing a plea of mitigation. It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below. The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea, and will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of submissions previously made. The Court spoke of the need for exceptional circumstances before this can be done, where it can be shown that there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood, and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45 at [11]; Keane v R [2011] VSCA 156 at [13],[18]; Bayram v R [2012] VSCA 6 at [28]-[29].
45In the face of a concession appropriately made by counsel at the sentencing hearing, exceptional circumstances would now need to be demonstrated before there was any variation to the sentence arising from a lack of parity.  No such circumstances are shown here.  
46In any event, his Honour carefully considered the parity question.  I am not persuaded that he fell into error in the sentences that he imposed on the Applicant and on the co-offender in the sense that the sentences individually or together objectively give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the Applicant.
47This ground fails.
48The orders I propose are these:
1. Leave to appeal granted.
2. Appeal dismissed.
49ADAMSON J: I agree with Davies J.

2763827,R v Phanekham (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 508,"Judgment
1On 20 November 2013 the offender, Viengsavanh Phanekham, was arraigned on an indictment that charged him with the murder of Mark William Puffett at Ambarvale on 20 June 2012.  Mr Phanekham pleaded not guilty.  The trial proceeded.
2On the afternoon of 29 November 2013 the jury returned with a verdict of not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter.  The proceedings were adjourned to 28 February 2014 for submissions on sentence. Both parties requested that and another date be vacated. Submissions on sentence were presented on 10 April 2014.
3The maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for twenty-five years (Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 24).  There is no standard non-parole period for the purposes of s 54A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the ""Sentencing Act"") for manslaughter.
Background
4As at 20 June 2012 the victim's de facto partner, Ms Calleja, her son aged 17, and her two youngest children lived at a house in Martha Way, Ambarvale.  The victim, Mr Puffett, was the father of her two youngest children. He had previously lived in the house but had recently left.  The offender lived next door.
5During 20 June 2012 Mr Puffett consumed alcohol continuously. He arrived at Ms Calleja's home at 2:30pm.  He was drunk.  Ms Calleja left the house and collected her two youngest children from school.  She returned to the house.  Mr Puffett played and talked with the children until around 4:30pm when he left.  Mr Puffett returned to the house at around 7:00pm.  He had been drinking in the meantime.
6By this stage he was very intoxicated.  He was described by some of the witnesses as being ""paralytic drunk"", staggering and stumbling.  A blood alcohol sample taken after his death revealed a blood alcohol reading of 0.268 grams per 100 ml.
7There is no doubt that in the immediate hour or so before his death at around 9.20pm Mr Puffett's behaviour was erratic.  Ms Calleja recalled that he was at times telling her that he loved her, and at other times stating that he hated her.  In cross examination she agreed that he was verbally aggressive.  At one point he smashed a picture and cut his hand.  He wiped blood on the front and back of Ms Calleja's blouse.  Later he left the house, went downstairs and banged on the door to the garage which Ms Calleja's son used as a bedroom.  He went inside, abused Ms Calleja's son and accidentally smashed a coffee table.  Ms Calleja was able to manoeuvre him out of the garage.  She also said that at one point he had his hands around her throat.  She told him to leave.  She went back into the house and closed both doors, but Mr Puffett kicked the door open.  Ms Calleja said that he went back out of the house, back down the stairs and banged on the door of the garage using both his hands and his fists.
8When she gave evidence it appeared that Ms Calleja was being protective of Mr Puffett's memory. She sought to deflect the suggestion that he was aggressive. Instead she sought to portray him as highly intoxicated and loud, but otherwise relatively harmless.  However, I am satisfied that in the period immediately preceding his death Mr Puffett acted aggressively and at times was violent. 
9Later that evening, the offender participated in an ""electronically recorded interview with a suspected person"" with the police (the ""first ERISP"").  The offender stated that he had been at home playing an on-line video game for a number of hours when he heard Mr Puffett next door.  He said that he yelled out ""Shut the fuck up"" twice.  He said that Mr Puffett yelled out something to the effect of ""[c]ome out to the fuckin' front yard, I'll fucking kill you"".  In his first ERISP the offender said he took a knife from his home and went into the street.  In another ERISP conducted early on the morning of 21 June 2012 (the ""second ERISP""), he said he took two knives.
10Sometime between 9.10pm and 9.22pm on 20 June 2012 there was a confrontation between the offender and Mr Puffett in Martha Way.  However, other than the participants, it was not directly observed by anyone.  One of the neighbours was observing the two men, but her view of the spot where they came into contact with each other was obstructed.  She did observe Mr Puffett ""shadow boxing"" and performing karate-like moves just prior to the confrontation.  She also recalled Mr Puffett yelling out ""[c]ome on, come out and have a go.  I'll fucking fight you"".
11The next observation of Mr Puffett was of him running back to Ms Calleja's house.  He was heard by Ms Calleja's son to be screaming out ""I've been stabbed, I've been stabbed"" and ""someone is trying to kill me"" as he ran past the garage door and up the stairs of Ms Calleja's house.  In his first ERISP Mr Phanekham told the police that he followed the deceased at this time ""yelling crap out at him"" and he stood ""just where his front porch is"", ie on the lawn, yelling at him.  Ms Calleja also saw the victim running across the lawn and a person she later found out was the offender following him.  She said the offender ran up the steps to her house.  I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he ran that far.
12Ms Calleja let Mr Puffett into her home.  He had one stab wound to his lower abdomen.  It must have been a horrendous scene.  Parts of his digestive system had fallen out of the stab wound.  He died very soon afterwards. The stab wound had an approximate depth of 10.5cm and length of 5.9cm.  The wound was crescent shaped with a maximum width of 2.3cm. The forensic pathologist called at the trial, Dr Irvine, stated that the cause of death was the effects of the stab wound.
13The offender returned to his house.  He cleaned blood from the knife and his hands.  He called his brother.  He sent a message to a friend with whom he had been playing the on-line video game.  At around 9:22pm he phoned '000' and told the operator that he had ""just stabbed someone"" and that the other person ""ran at me and I just pulled out a knife"". 
14The police and ambulance arrived at the scene very soon afterwards.  Mr Puffett died either prior to or shortly after their arrival.  The police found the offender in his house.  They recovered a knife from his kitchen.  The knife's dimensions matched those of Mr Puffett's stab wound.
15At 11:34pm on 20 June 2012 the offender participated in the first ERISP.  I have already referred to parts of it.  Early in the morning of 21 June 2012 the offender participated in the second ERISP.  As noted, during that ERISP he disclosed that he had taken a second knife to the confrontation.  Another knife was seized from his kitchen, but the dimensions of this knife were such that ultimately it was not alleged that it was used to stab Mr Puffett.
Issues at the trial and findings
16From the beginning to the end the Crown case was that the offender deliberately stabbed Mr Puffett in the upper abdomen because he was angry and fed up with his annoying behaviour.  The Crown alleged that he stabbed Mr Puffett once with the intention of killing him or inflicting grievous bodily harm.
17The first issue for the jury's consideration was whether it was the deliberate act of the offender that caused the death of the victim.  In his first ERISP the offender stated that he simply pointed the knife at Mr Puffett and he ""came towards me"" and ""walked into it"".  The offender made other statements to the police to similar effect.  The Crown did not seek to have the jury consider a case of murder on the basis that the relevant act of the offender was the display of a knife at the scene of the confrontation, undertaken ""with reckless indifference to human life"".  Accordingly, the jury were instructed that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the ""accused deliberately inserted the knife or knives into the deceased's abdomen"", and that if they were not so satisfied then the offender had to be acquitted of both murder and manslaughter.  It is clear from the verdict that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender deliberately inserted a knife into Mr Puffett.
18The jury were also instructed that to find the offender guilty of murder they had to be satisfied that the act causing death, namely the insertion of a knife into Mr Puffett's abdomen, was done with an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him.  In that context they were instructed that any intoxicated state of the offender had to be taken into account in determining whether he was capable of forming that intention.  In his first ERISP the offender stated he drank approximately half a bottle of bourbon between 4:00pm and the time of the killing.  He also stated this in the '000' call he made shortly after he returned to his house  A photograph of his home reveals an empty bourbon bottle.  I am satisfied that he consumed what he stated.  
19At the trial, a pharmacologist, Dr Pearl, calculated that, assuming he consumed that amount of alcohol, the offender would have had a blood alcohol reading of 0.176 at 9:15pm, and a reading in the range of 0.119 to 0.182, with a median of 0.140 at the time he commenced his first ERISP.  The jury also had available to it the video of the ERISP, the audio of the '000' call, and the observations of the police officers who attended at the scene and conducted the interview as to his state of intoxication.  Those officers had denied that the offender displayed signs of being affected by alcohol.
20The jury were also instructed that to prove the charge of murder the Crown also had to prove that the act causing the death of Mr Puffett was not carried out in self defence.  The issue of self defence arose because, as I have stated, in his first ERISP the offender stated that the confrontation escalated when Mr Puffett yelled out to him ""[c]ome to the fuckin' front yard, I'll fucking kill you"", and that he responded by taking one or two knives with him.  The offender also stated that when he confronted Mr Puffett, Mr Puffett was angry and acted as though he was ""goin' to punch me or some shit or hit me"".  This all took place in a context that Mr Puffett had been aggressive with his family and was observed by a neighbour to be aggressive as he awaited the confrontation in Martha Way.
21Accordingly, the jury were instructed that to disprove self defence the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that (i) the offender personally believed his conduct was necessary to defend himself; and (ii) the conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as the offender perceived them.  The jury was also instructed that any intoxicated state of the offender had to be taken into account when determining whether he believed that his conduct was necessary to defend himself, and in determining the circumstances as the offender perceived them, but could not be taken into account in determining whether his response to those circumstances was reasonable.
22The instructions to the jury were such that, if they found beyond reasonable doubt that the offender deliberately inserted a knife into Mr Puffett's abdomen, then there were two alternatives by which the jury could have returned a verdict of manslaughter.  
23The first alternative was if the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill Mr Puffett or inflict grievous bodily harm upon him, but nevertheless was satisfied that the offender's conduct in stabbing Mr Puffett was an unlawful and ""dangerous"" act (ie manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act).  The jury were instructed that an act was ""dangerous"" if a reasonable person in the position of the offender would have realised that, by that act, Mr Puffett  was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. The jury were advised that in making such an assessment any self-induced intoxication of the offender was irrelevant.
24The second basis for manslaughter was if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to inflict death or grievous bodily harm upon Mr Puffett, but also considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the offender personally believed his conduct was necessary to defend himself, while being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them (ie excessive self defence).
25Accordingly, I must determine upon which basis the offender will be sentenced for the crime of manslaughter.  The findings I make must be consistent with the jury's verdict, and any finding of fact ""made against an offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt"" (Cheung v R [2001] HCA 67; 209 CLR 1 at [14] per Gleeson CJ (""Cheung""), citing R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374).  It is not obligatory to sentence an offender on the basis of facts consistent with the verdict, that are most favourable to the offender, although the practical effect of requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt of any facts adverse to the offender may lead to that result (Cheung id).
26Both the Crown Prosecutor and Senior Counsel for the offender, Mr Young SC, submitted that the offender should be sentenced on the basis that he committed manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. 
27The Crown submitted that the evidence that the offender subjectively believed that it was necessary to stab Mr Puffett to defend himself was so sparse that it should be discounted.  The Crown pointed to the following matters, none of which were in dispute, namely:  the offender's statement that he was annoyed by Mr Puffett as his reason for joining the confrontation; the obviously intoxicated state of Mr Puffett meant that the offender could not have believed he represented a threat; it was the offender who chose to attend the confrontation armed with a knife; and the actions of the offender in chasing after Mr Puffett and yelling at him after he stabbed him.  These submissions should be accepted.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did not believe it was necessary to stab Mr Puffett to defend himself. 
28It follows that I will proceed to sentence the offender on the basis that it was not established that in stabbing Mr Puffett he intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, and that he committed manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act.
29One matter that arises in sentencing the offender is what role his intoxication, if any, played in his commission of the offence.  As noted, the jury were instructed that, in determining whether he had the requisite intent, they were required to consider whether he might have been so affected by alcohol that no such state of mind was in fact formed by him (Crimes Act, s 428C).  However, the jury's verdict does not necessarily mean that it so found.
30It is also consistent with the jury's verdict for me to conclude that the offender's level of intoxication did not impair his ability to appreciate the consequences of his actions.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it did not.  I have listened to the '000' call and viewed the first ERISP. Further, as noted,  the police officers who encountered the offender on the evening of 20 June 2012 were all firm in their evidence that the offender did not appear to be affected or at least significantly affected by alcohol. I accept the Crown's submission that his alcohol consumption may have loosened his inhibitions and perhaps made him more aggressive, but it did not impair his ability to control his actions, make decisions or appreciate the consequences of his actions. 
31As noted, in the case of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, an act is dangerous if a reasonable person in the position of an accused would have realised that by that act the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury.  In this case I am not only satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender's act had that quality, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender knew it had that quality, even if he did not intend to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
32The end result is that the offender is to be sentenced for deliberately inflicting a single stab wound in circumstances where he did not intend to inflict death or grievous bodily harm, but did realise that Mr Puffett was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury.  He did so in circumstances where he called out to Mr Puffett because he was annoyed at the noise he was making.  Mr Puffett was loud, aggressive and issued a challenge.  However, the offender dramatically escalated the exchange by responding to that challenge and seizing a knife or knives.  By the time he confronted Mr Puffett the offender must have known he was drunk and knew that, while he was aggressive, he was no real threat.  The offender knew that if he wanted to he could easily walk away, but instead he stabbed Mr Puffett then chased and abused him.
Victim impact
33At the time of his death Mark Puffett was thirty-four years of age.  In her evidence Ms Calleja stated that she and the deceased had been in a relationship for twelve and half years.  As stated, he was the father of her two youngest children.  One of those children was aged ten and the other six when their father died.  Ms Calleja also said that Mr Puffett had ""been in [the] lives"" of her two other children ""since they were five and six years old"".
34Victim impact statements were provided to the Court by Mark Puffett's brother, Stephen Puffett, his mother Marilyn Puffett, and his sister Melanie Hall.  Stephen Puffett read his statement out to the Court as well as those provided by his mother and sister.  It was clear that he was still feeling the distress of his brother's death.
35Stephen Puffett spoke of his shock in losing a sibling in such circumstances, without warning or any chance to say goodbye.  He said that he constantly ""see[s] [his] brother's face, feels his presence, hear[s] songs that [they] associate with him and [is aware] of little reminders of what [his] brother was like and liked doing"".  He described the pain he feels about the fact that he no longer has the opportunity to spend another family occasion such as Christmas or Easter with his brother, and the sense of loss for his children in no longer having their uncle.
36In her victim impact statement, Marilyn Puffett describes how her son's death has ""left the biggest hole in [her] and [her] husband's heart"", especially as he has not only been taken from them, but also taken from his siblings and his own children.  She describes how her husband feels ""lost"", especially as her son had been an indispensable help for him in dealing with recent health issues.  As with Stephen Puffett, she had difficulty in comprehending how he can have died in such circumstances and still spends ""every day thinking he might come through the door"", before remembering that he is gone.
37Likewise, Mark Puffett's sister, Melanie, has had difficulty coming to terms with the loss of her younger brother.  She describes how everyday sights and sounds, such as observations and songs, bring back memories of him and remind her that he is no longer with her and that she did not have the chance to say goodbye.  She describes her profound sadness from knowing that Mr Puffett will not have the opportunity to spend time with his sixteen nieces and nephews.  She also describes the effect on her own daughters as they try to comprehend how a relative could lose their life in such circumstances.
38One of the many difficult aspects for a victim's family in murder and manslaughter trials is that sometimes they must suffer in silence as they hear evidence in a public forum about their loved one which portrays them in an unflattering light. This was such a trial.  The victim impact statements play an important role in balancing the picture presented by the evidence adduced at a trial.  They help to ensure that Mr Puffett is not defined by the evidence that, of necessity, had to be elicited about the events leading up to his death.  The victim impact statements portray him as a person who formed part of a large, caring and supportive family who will miss him deeply.
39The significance of victim impact statements was discussed in MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226 at [61] to [63] per Grove J, Hidden and Kirby JJ agreeing.  I am not to treat them as evidence upon which I can act or material which operates in aggravation of the offence or is otherwise adverse to the offender.  Nevertheless the Court acknowledges the deep loss to Mark Puffett's family caused by his death at the hands of the offender.
Offender's personal history
40The offender was born in September 1976.  As at the date of the offence he was thirty-six years of age.  He is now thirty-eight.  Tendered on his behalf was a statement from his sister, Ms Viengmaly Phanekham (also known as Jeni), as well as a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen.  The report from Dr Nielssen recounts aspects of the offender's personal history, as well as relaying statements made to him by the offender.  In some cases sentencing courts are justifiably sceptical of personal histories and observations from an offender which are elicited via psychiatrist reports.  However, in this case the history as given to Dr Nielssen is largely consistent with the evidence led at trial, is otherwise supported by the offender's sister, or generally uncontroversial.
41The offender came to Australia with his family from Laos at the age of four.  He was the second youngest of seven children.  He grew up in the Campbelltown area. He attended local primary schools and then Ambarvale high school. He left school at the end of Year 10.  Dr Nielssen recounts him stating that his academic performance ""wasn't really good"".
42Jeni Phanekham described an incident when the offender was in primary school.  He was struck by a rock in the head that caused a severe injury that left him with stitches and a huge scar.  She recounted her belief that the throwing of the rock was racially motivated.  She observed that, prior to the incident, the offender was a bright and intelligent child.  She said that he was also quiet with a caring nature.  However, she said that after the incident his behaviour changed.  He became fearful of further assaults and had trouble sleeping.  She says he deteriorated when he commenced consuming alcohol and taking drugs.  His behaviour became erratic, in that at times he was unpredictably happy and at other times he was severely depressed and suicidal.
43Dr Nielssen recounts the offender stating that after he left school he could not hold long term employment, although he attempted various menial jobs.  Dr Nielssen said that approximately five or six years ago the offender was granted a disability support pension on the grounds of depression.  Dr Nielssen states that he has never had a long term relationship and that his main hobbies were watching Japanese cartoons and playing computer games.
44The picture painted by this evidence is entirely consistent with the evidence that was adduced at the trial.  It suggested that he was a person living an aimless existence.  He was aged in his mid-thirties and spent his time drinking by himself at home and playing computer games.  However the evidence led at the trial from Dr Nielssen and the offender's sister revealed that he also played a significant role in looking after his aging mother.  His father passed away a number of years ago.  His mother lived with the offender at some point, although it is not clear whether she was living with him on the night of the offence.  Apparently her health is deteriorating and she has had difficulty visiting him in gaol.
Prior offences
45The Crown tendered the offender's criminal record.  In 1995 and 1997 he was convicted of common assault.  On the first occasion he received a fine and on the second occasion he received a recognisance under former s 558 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  In 1997 he was also convicted of possession of a prohibited drug for which he received a recognisance under former s 558.  He has convictions for various driving offences involving alcohol and was disqualified from driving in 1999 and 2005.  The penalties he received for these offences suggest that, considered in isolation, each offence was relatively minor, but the combination of them has some significance.
46However, there is one matter on his criminal record that is of particular significance.  On 15 October 2006 the offender was convicted of an offence of being armed with the intention to commit an indictable offence contrary to s 114(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.  He had pleaded guilty.  He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven months which was wholly suspended pursuant to s 12(1) of the Sentencing Act.
47The facts of that offence were that during an afternoon in October 2006 the offender believed that rocks were being thrown into his backyard by the children of the occupant of the house next to his neighbour's house.  He went and spoke to the children's mother about the incident and returned to his house.  About an hour and a half later he believed that rocks were still being thrown.  He went inside his house and ""obtained a black handled, steel bladed kitchen knife and placed it down the rear of his shorts with the top still visible above his shirt"", and also ""took a white steel pole and a long thin tree branch which he placed inside the hollow pole"".  He jumped the fence at the rear of his yard, walked through his next door neighbour's garden and jumped over another fence into the rear of the children's house in an attempt to catch them in the act of throwing rocks.
48The offender was confronted by their mother. He complained to her about the children throwing rocks.  The mother observed the knife protruding from the top of his shorts and asked him to leave.  The offender refused to leave and told the mother and another person present to chastise the children.  At this point, the offender was holding onto the white steel pole as he pulled out the tree branch from inside it.  After a further conversation, he is said to have ""produced the knife from the rear of his pants and placed it in his palm with the pole and the branch"".  This occurred within the immediate presence of the mother, her children and another person.  
49The offender returned to his house.  He was later arrested.  When interviewed he made full admissions.  He told the police that he only wanted to scare the children, and he took the weapons so it would ""make the children take him more seriously"".  It was common ground that the offender also told the police that he had been consuming alcohol.
50There are obvious similarities between this offence and the current one.  On both occasions the offender was quick to resort to using a knife in response to some annoyance. On the first occasion he came close to being imprisoned, but on this occasion imprisonment is inevitable. Subject to considering the next matter, the circumstances of the earlier offence suggest that specific deterrence is a significant factor in this case.
Dr Nielssen's diagnosis and prospects of rehabilitation
51Dr Nielssen diagnosed the offender as suffering from chronic depression, a substance use disorder which was said to be in remission, and traumatic brain injury.  The diagnosis of chronic depression was made on the basis of a history of his suffering long term symptoms of depression commencing in his late teenage years, including chronic low mood, lack of energy and anxiety.  He considered that the factors contributing to his present depression included the effects of the head injury noted above, his frustration with disability, the effects of chronic substance abuse and, of course, his current circumstances.
52Dr Nielssen's diagnosis of substance use disorder was made on the basis of the account of several years of opioid dependence and abuse, a period of abuse of methylamphetamine, as well as abuse of sedative medication and the offender's account of his alcohol intake.  Dr Nielssen described this disorder as being in remission on the basis of his detention in the ""relatively drug-free environment"" of gaol.
53Dr Nielssen's diagnosis of a traumatic brain injury was made on the basis of the offender's account of suffering a head injury resulting in a fractured skull.  Dr Nielssen considered this to be a limitation on the reliability of his diagnosis.  He did not rely on any documents relating to his past or recent treatment, although he noted that the offender was able to provide a reasonably detailed history.  As noted, the suggestion that he suffered a traumatic brain injury is supported by the evidence of his sister. 
54I accept the first two diagnoses of Dr Nielssen.  As I have stated, the evidence at trial about the offender's lifestyle was consistent with someone who is effectively a recluse and who suffered a long term chronic depression. Similarly, the evidence as to his abuse of alcohol on the day of the offence was consistent with someone who has been abusing drugs and alcohol for a long period.
55I also accept Dr Nielssen's diagnosis of traumatic brain injury, although its effects were not described in any detail. In particular, there was no evidence that the offender's cognitive functioning was impaired and, in particular, that he was impeded in his ability to appreciate the potential consequences of his actions.
56Generally I am not satisfied that there was any causal connection between any of these conditions and the commission of the offence.  It follows from that and the other findings I have made that considerations of both general and specific deterrence are of real significance in assessing the appropriate sentence for the offender.
57Dr Nielssen also stated as follows:
""The main factors contributing to Mr Phanekham's behaviour appear to have been his intoxication with alcohol and his coincidental confrontation with another intoxicated person.  He has reached his late thirties without having been in prison, and hence would have a relatively low risk of further offences of a similar nature, although I note the history of a previous incident involving a knife some years ago.  His risk of reoffending is further reduced by sustained abstinence from alcohol and other illegal drugs.""
58I have already made findings concerning the significance of the offender's intoxication to the commission of this offence.  I agree with Dr Nielssen that one significant matter affecting his risk of reoffending will be whether he can sustain his abstinence from alcohol and illegal drugs.  However, notwithstanding that he will now have an enforced sustained period of abstinence in gaol and presumably supervision upon his release, in the medium to longer term there is still an appreciable risk that he would return to a lifestyle that involved the abuse of alcohol and  illegal drugs. 
59Overall I consider the prospects that the offender will ever commit an offence as serious as this one in the future to be relatively low.  Despite his limitations, the evidence suggested that the offender is a person with a reasonable level of intelligence who is capable of making the basic choices to enable him to avoid committing a serious offence.  I am less optimistic, however, that in the medium to longer term he would not reoffend at some level.  The risk of his return to using drugs and alcohol carries with it a concomitant risk that he may revert to some level of violence in response to a perceived slight.
60Overall I consider that the offender has a moderate risk of re-offending, although there is a relatively low risk of his committing an offence as serious as this one.
Aggravating and mitigating factors
61Subsection 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act lists a series of aggravating factors the Court is to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence.  These factors cannot be considered as aggravating the offence if they are elements of the offence.  Subsection 21A(3) lists a series of mitigating factors.
62Two aggravating factors are potentially relevant to this case.  The first is that the offence involved the use of a weapon, namely a knife (s 21A(2)(c)).
63The second is that provided for in s 21A(2)(d), namely that the offender has ""a record of previous convictions (particularly if the offender is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence and has a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences)"".  The phrase ""serious personal violence offence"" is defined to mean any ""personal violence offence"" within the meaning of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW) s 4(1) which is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of five years or more (Sentencing Act s 21A(6)).  The offence of manslaughter for which the offender is being sentenced is clearly a ""serious personal violence offence"".  However, the offender does not have a record of previous convictions for ""serious personal violence offences"".  
64Although his assault convictions were all ""personal violence offences"", those offences were not punishable by a term of imprisonment of five years or more (Crimes Act, s 61).  His conviction under s 114 of the Crimes Act was not defined to be a conviction for a ""personal violence offence"".  Nevertheless, I consider his record of previous convictions, and in particular his conviction for that offence, is an aggravating factor in relation to the sentence to be imposed.  In 2006 the offender waved a knife around in a context that would have been very frightening for the mother and her children.  He was treated leniently and avoided gaol however he did not learn his lesson with knives.
65Mr Young SC also pointed to a number of mitigating factors.  He submitted that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity (s 21A(3)(b)).  I accept that this was so.  The offence was a spontaneous overreaction by the offender to the victim's conduct.
66Mr Young SC also referred to s 21A(3)(c) which refers to the offender being provoked by the victim.  Mr Young SC accepted that, on any view, the conduct his client was found to have engaged in was a drastic overreaction to any conduct of Mr Puffett, but submitted that does not prevent this mitigating factor being established.  Clearly s 21A(3)(c) can extend to a wider set of circumstances than that envisaged by the defence of provocation in s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900.  Thus, in a strict sense, I accept Mr Young SC's submission that there was a small element of provocation.  However, it must be remembered that the offender was not directly affected by any aspect of Mr Puffett's conduct on the night, beyond finding it too loud.  The offender did not intervene because he was concerned for the welfare of others, the general wellbeing of the street, or because he was somehow personally affronted by Mr Puffett's behaviour towards his own family.  Instead he intervened because the victim was too loud and was disturbing his concentration on a computer game.  While that can be described as a provocation, it is not a mitigating factor that I would attribute any real weight to in the sentencing process
67Subsection 21A(3)(g) provides that it is a mitigating factor if the offender is unlikely to re-offend.  Subsection 21A(3)(h) provides that it is a mitigating factor if the offender has ""good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise"".  I have already made my findings about the offender's likelihood of re-offending and his prospects of rehabilitation.  In view of those findings, I am not satisfied that these mitigating factors have been established. 
68Subsection 21A(3)(i) provides that it is a mitigating factor if it can be shown that:
""(i) ... remorse [has been] shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:
 (i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and
 (ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)""
69The offender did not give evidence at the trial nor did he give evidence before me.  Mr Young SC submitted, correctly, that it is not necessary that the evidence of remorse be given by the offender directly to the Court on oath (see Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1 per Fullerton J at [17], with whom McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J agreed).  
70However, in this case there is very little evidence of remorse sufficient to meet s 21A(3)(i). In the offender's first ERISP he enquired about the position of the victim, but that is all.  The topic of remorse is not addressed in Dr Nielssen's report.  The offender's sister's affidavit records that on every occasion that she has visited him in gaol the offender was ""genuinely remorseful for what occurred and was depressed and wished that it didn't happen and wanted to resume his quiet life and look after his mother"".  This does not satisfy me that he has accepted responsibility for his actions, or acknowledged the injury and damage caused by them.  I am satisfied that the offender regrets his actions and their consequences for himself (and his mother), but that is not the same as being remorseful.
Discount for offer of a plea
71The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 20 June 2012.  It was agreed that, approximately a week prior to the trial, he offered to plead guilty to manslaughter on the basis of an unlawful and dangerous act.  The plea was not accepted.  Consistent with the fair manner in which she conducted the entirety of the proceedings, the Crown Prosecutor accepted that the offender was entitled to a ""10 to 15% discount"" for the offer of that plea.
72The offer that was made was inconsistent with one significant aspect of the offender's case at trial, namely his putting in issue whether his act in stabbing the deceased was a voluntary one.  Further, even though that offer was made, it was not accompanied by the entry of a plea of guilty to manslaughter but not guilty to murder when he was arraigned.  Nevertheless, I agree with the Crown Prosecutor that the utilitarian value of the offer of a plea is something that should be recognised.  I consider that it warrants a discount of 10%.
Intoxication of the offender
73On or about 31 January 2014 the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment (Assault and Intoxication) Act 2014 came into force.  Amongst other changes it amended the Sentencing Act by inserting a new s 21A(5AA) which provided as follows:
""(5AA) Special rule for self-induced intoxicationIn determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the self-induced intoxication of the offender at the time the offence was committed is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor.""
74This amendment was expressed to apply to the determination of a sentence for an offence whenever committed, unless before its commencement ""... the court has convicted the person being sentenced of the offence, or ... a court has accepted a plea of guilty and the plea has not been withdrawn"" (Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment (Assault and Intoxication) Act 2014 No 2 (NSW) sch 3 item 4). 
75The jury's verdict was entered on the indictment on the day it was delivered.  It was also recorded on Justicelink.  However, I did not state that the offender was ""convicted"" or formally order that a conviction be entered. Nevertheless, that does not matter, as ""where there is a trial with a jury ... the return by the jury of a verdict of guilty both establishes guilt and amounts itself to a conviction"" (Griffiths v R (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 301 per Barwick CJ). It follows that the offender was convicted prior to s 21A(5AA) commencing.
76At various points in this judgment I have referred to the self induced intoxication of the offender. It is doubtful whether any aspect of my consideration of it amounts to treating it as a ""mitigating factor"".  However, even if it did,  s 21A(5AA) does not preclude that because it does not apply to this proceeding. 
Seriousness of the Offence
77Of all crimes, manslaughter is said to ""thro[w] up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability"" (R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Gleeson CJ, 12 December 1995, unrep) (""Blacklidge"").  Even within the categories of manslaughter, such as unlawful and dangerous act or excessive self defence, the range of circumstances is ""notoriously wide"" and an offence in one category is not necessarily better or worse than one in another (Berrier v R [2009] NSWCCA 40 at [25]).  Nevertheless the starting point is that manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life and there must be an assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the offence (Blacklidge id).
78I have already described the circumstances of the offence.  It was aggravated by the use of a weapon.  It was not premeditated nor did it form part of some organised criminal activity.  Yet it was serious.  A suburban street became the venue for a showdown with a knife.  General deterrence is a significant factor in such cases.  If it is sensible to speak of a range for manslaughters or a range of manslaughters by an unlawful and dangerous act, then this offence was in the middle of that range.
Special circumstances
79Mr Young SC submitted that it was appropriate to make a finding of special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act and vary the maximum ratio that the balance of term bears to the non-parole period.
80Mr Young SC pointed to the material from Dr Nielssen concerning the offender's chronic depression and chronic substance abuse.  He referred to Dr Nielssen's statement that the offender will require ""long term psychiatric care"".  Mr Young submitted that it was in the community's interest that the offender's rehabilitation and release are monitored long term by a parole officer who has the ability to resort to legal sanctions to ensure the offender's alcohol and substance abuse do not reappear.
81I have already accepted Dr Nielssen's diagnosis of depression and chronic substance abuse.  As stated, those matters were entirely consistent with the evidence that was presented at trial.  I also agree that the offender will require supervision and support upon his release from custody and that is best undertaken if backed by a prospect of return to custody.  However, in order for special circumstances to be made out there must exist significant positive signs which show that, if the offender is allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful and that this is not merely a possibility (see R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243 at [20]; R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40 at [57] per Bellew J with whom Bathurst CJ and Hoeben CJ at CL agreed).  I am not satisfied of this requirement.  Otherwise it should be noted that the sentence that I will impose will allow for a reasonably lengthy period of supervision.
Conclusion and sentence
82While they acknowledged the limitations inherent in such an exercise, both Counsel referred me to numerous decisions imposing sentences for manslaughter including manslaughters by an unlawful and dangerous act. I have considered those decisions but will not traverse them in this judgment. They bear out the observations I have already made as to the wide array of circumstances comprehended by the offence of manslaughter.
83Debates about the appropriate sentences for murder and manslaughter, and the difference between the two, generate considerable heat but very little light. No doubt the family and friends of many victims attempt to measure the penalty imposed by reference to the loss they have suffered and often come up short.  However, in applying both the Crimes Act and the Sentencing Act, the Court must undertake an exercise that not only requires consideration of the harm done to the victim but other factors as well (Sentencing Act, s 3A) . Thus the Court is obliged to respect the difference in moral culpability between the crime of murder and that of manslaughter. It must also balance considerations of deterrence, denunciation and rehabilitation. These factors coalesce to produce an outcome in the form of a specified period of incarceration, even though the relevant figure is distilled in a context where the interests being weighed are incapable of having mathematical values attributed to them.
84In this case, after allowing for the discount that I have referred to and some rounding, I have assessed the appropriate sanction as being imprisonment for a period of eight years constituted by a non-parole period of six years and a balance of term of two years.  As the offender was taken into custody on 20 June 2012, it follows that his custodial sentence should commence from that date.
85Mr Phanekham, the offence of manslaughter is a ""serious and violent offence"" as defined in s 5A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW).  I am obliged by s 25C of that Act to advise you of the existence of that legislation and of its application to the offence you have committed.
86Viengsavanh Phanekham, for the manslaughter of Mark William Puffett you are convicted.  You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  Pursuant to s 44(1) and s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act I set a non-parole of six years commencing on 20 June 2012, and an additional term of two years commencing 20 June 2018 and ending on 19 June 2020.
87The sentence will be taken to have commenced on 20 June 2012.  The offender will be eligible for release on parole on 20 June 2018 and the sentence will expire on 19 June 2020.

2763832,R v Xie (No. 5) [2014] NSWSC 588,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: On Thursday next, 8 May 2014, the trial of the Accused, Lian Bin (Robert) Xie, will commence on five counts of murder. He is charged with the murder, on or about 18 July 2009, of Min (Norman) Lin, Yun Li (Lily) Lin, Yun Bin (Irene) Lin, Henry Lin and Terry Lin.
	
	
	At the time of their deaths on 18 July 2009, Henry Lin was 12 years old and Terry Lin was nine years old. Min Lin and Lily Lin were the parents of Henry and Terry Lin.
	
	
	The sole surviving member of the family is Ms AB who, as at July 2009, was aged 15 years.
	
	
	In advance of the trial, an issue has been raised concerning the operation of provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Section 15A of that Act is self-executing in nature, and prohibits the publication or broadcast of certain matters including, relevantly in this case, the names of the deceased Henry Lin and Terry Lin and of Ms AB, the sister of Henry and Terry.
	
	
	Section 15A prohibits the publication or broadcast of the names of those persons to the public, or a section of the public, by publication in a newspaper or periodical, publication by radio or television broadcast or other electronic broadcast, by the internet or by any other means of dissemination: s.15A(2).
	
	
	The issues which have arisen at this stage concern the ability of the media to publish the names of Henry, Terry or Ms AB.
	
	
	Section 15E of the Act provides for an ability for the senior available next of kin of a child deceased to give consent to publication of the name of the child. In the present case, there is no senior available next of kin of Henry and Terry, because their parents are themselves deceased as a result of the events of 18 July 2009. Accordingly, s.15E has no direct application in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	Section 15D(1) provides for an exception to the prohibition upon publication or broadcasting in two circumstances: Firstly, in the case of a person who was under the age of 16 years at the time of publication or broadcasting, with the consent of the Court; secondly, in the case of a person who is of or above the age of 16 years at the time of publication or broadcasting, with the consent of that person.
	
	
	Section 15D(2) provides that a Court is not to give consent under the section, except with the concurrence of the child or, if the child is incapable of giving concurrence, unless the Court is of an opinion that it is in the public interest that consent be given.
	
	
	Turning, firstly, to the circumstances of Ms AB. Ms AB was 15 years of age as at 18 July 2009. She is some 20 years of age at the present time.
	
	
	Section 15D(1)(b) provides that there may be publication of her name with her consent. I note that such consent can only be given if the additional requirement in s.15D(3) is met concerning legal advice. However, it is the position that Ms AB does not wish her name to be mentioned in any publication or broadcast of the proceedings. The effect of that election is that, as a result of the self-executing nature of s.15A, there can be no publication or broadcasting of Ms AB's name. No further order of the Court is required in that respect. It is the consequence of the operation of the statute.
	
	
	Turning then to the position of Terry and Henry, I accept that s.15D(1)(a) and (2) provide the Court with the power to permit publication of the names of Terry and Henry, if the Court consents to that approach being taken, with the Court only being able to express that opinion if satisfied that it is in the public interest that consent be given.
	
	
	The application of the public interest discretion in the predecessor provision to s.15A (s.11 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987) was considered in R v Sam (No 1) [2009] NSWSC 542, where consent was given to the publication of the name of the deceased child victim, noting that the public interest discretion had regard to the open justice principle.
	
	
	That approach in R v Sam (No 1) was accepted in R v BW (No. 2) [2009] NSWSC 595; 196 A Crim R 329, where RA Hulme J considered the question of non-publication of the name of a child victim in a murder case.
	
	
	Although accepting the approach in R v Sam (No 1), his Honour had regard to the interests of the siblings of the child victim in that case, in determining that there should be no publication of the name, or any photograph of the child victim who, in due course, was referred to by her middle name, Ebony.
	
	
	RA Hulme J applied the principles in R v Sam (No 1) and R v BW (No. 2) in R v PC [2010] NSWSC 533, a case which considered the construction and operation of s.15A and following of the Act. In that decision, publication was not permitted because of the continuing impact of publication upon the surviving siblings if the name of the child victim was published.
	
	
	If there was a senior available next of kin of Henry and Terry, it would be necessary for that senior available next of kin, in deciding whether consent to publication should be given, to have regard to factors included in s.15E(3), which requires account to be taken of the impact of such publication or broadcasting on a sibling. There is, as I have said, no senior available next of kin present in this case.
	
	
	It does seem to me, however, that, when the Court is considering the public interest test in s.15D, it should have regard to the possible impact of publication or broadcasting on a sibling. In the present case, there will be available for publication and broadcasting the names of the three adult victims. Two of those victims are the parents of Henry and Terry.
	
	
	It may be said that identification of Henry and Terry may serve indirectly to identify Ms AB. However, it should be observed immediately that the identification of the parents will occur in any event in the circumstances of this trial.
	
	
	No submission has been advanced that the Court should decline to give consent to publication of the names of Henry and Terry in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	It is, of course, a matter for the Court to determine whether the relevant opinion can be formed by reference to the public interest test. The public interest test has regard, amongst other things, to the open justice principle.
	
	
	In the circumstances of the case, I am satisfied that the consent of the Court should be given to the publication or broadcasting of the names of Henry and Terry Lin.
	
	
	For the purpose of s.15D(1)(a) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, the Court gives consent to the publication of the names of Henry Lin and Terry Lin as part of any reporting of the proceedings.
	
	
	I note that the publication or broadcasting of the name of Ms AB remains prohibited by operation of s.15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. No further order is required in that respect.

2763833,R v McKnight (No. 2) [2014] NSWSC 557,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Mr McKnight is standing trial for the murder of David Ray. It is common ground in this case that Mr McKnight repeatedly kicked David Ray in George Street Sydney in the early hours of 25th March 2012. 

2There are two issues in the trial. The first is whether, in kicking Mr Ray, Mr McKnight had at that time the requisite intention of inflicting really serious personal injury upon him. 

3The second is, if the jury are satisfied as to the first, whether he is entitled on the basis of the partial defence of substantial impairment to have his criminal liability for murder reduced to manslaughter.

4Mr McKnight has exercised his right to silence by declining the opportunity to participate in a formal record of interview with arresting police officers and he has not given evidence in his trial. There are, however, three categories of accounts given by Mr McKnight in evidence. The first category relates to contemporaneous statements made to police officers. In that regard he spoke to police officers in George Street on 25th March, shortly after he inflicted injury upon Mr Ray, and, after being cautioned, he made some statements to arresting police who arrived at his home on 3rd April 2012 for the purpose of executing a search warrant.

5The second category relates to clinical records of his pre and post 25th March 2012 medical treatment for a condition of either paranoid schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, depending upon which view of the medical evidence one accepts. 

6The third category relates to the history he gave to each of Doctors Nielssen and Allnutt, who carried out medico-legal examinations of his mental state for the purpose of giving evidence at the trial.

7The Crown submits, and I think it is fair to say, especially in relation to that third category, that I should give the jury a warning that those accounts may be unreliable in accordance with s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Such a direction would extend to an exposition of the reasons why those accounts may be unreliable. I will not set out the direction for which the Crown contend. It is set out on the third page of MFI 12.

8Alternatively, acknowledging that the giving of such a direction may be a ""delicate exercise"", see R v Wilson (2005) 62 NSWLR at 346 commencing at [36], I should consider giving a direction in accordance with Mule v The Queen [2005] HCA 49; (2005) 79 ALJR 1573. The suggested direction is set out on page four of MFI 12.

9Mr Brady of counsel for the accused initially took the position that no direction whatsoever should be given about these statements because to do so would have the effect of forcing an accused person to give evidence, diluting very substantially the right to silence shared by all members of our community. However, during the course of oral argument Mr Brady accepted that a direction along the lines of that formulated by the learned Crown Prosecutor derived from Mule v The Queen was appropriate especially in relation to the medico-legal histories.

10The phrase ""a delicate exercise"" comes from the judgment of Hunt J in Wilson. It refers to the difficulty of pointing out the potential unreliability of hearsay accounts given in evidence and attributed to the accused with proper maintenance of the right to silence.

11I accept the force of the Crown submissions that, particularly in relation to the medico legal histories, there is a risk that a person may, I will use a neutral phrase, put their best foot forward for the purpose of advancing his defence. I also acknowledge that some part of the accounts given to the qualified specialists may not be consistent with what can be derived from the contemporaneous record of the CCTV footage.

12It seems to me that the potentiality for unreliability is likely to vary significantly amongst each of the three categories I have identified. In general terms, although a person questioned by the police may, likewise, put his best foot forward, the contemporaneous and spontaneous accounts given on 25th March and 3rd April 2012 are much less likely to be unreliable than, say, the medico-legal accounts. Also, the history given to doctors for the purpose of receiving medical treatment, especially the treatment given before 25 March 2012, is likely to be inherently reliable. Pointing out these differences amongst the categories rather exacerbates the necessary delicacy of the exercise of giving a s165 direction which gives an appropriate warning but at the same time effectively preserves the significance and importance for the jury of the right to silence.

13I think in the end that it is appropriate to give a Mule v The Queen direction in relation to the histories received by Doctors' Allnutt and Nielssen, but not to give the more expansive s165 warning for which the Crown contend in relation to that category and the second category I have identified. 

14I should point out that in respect of the first category the Crown, in accordance with all propriety, have urged upon the jury that they should rely upon the accounts given to the police as being evidence from which they can draw the inference, in conjunction with other evidence, that the accused had the necessary intent at the time he kicked Mr Ray.

15Essentially, and in substance, it was put to the jury that the violent and ugly language he used bespoke a violent and ugly intent, specifically intent to inflict really serious personal injury.

16For those reasons I will give a Mule v R direction as formulated by Senior Counsel for the Crown.

		09 May 2014",2014-05-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763847,R v McKnight (No. 3) [2014] NSWSC 558,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1Yesterday, in answering a question from the Jury, which indicated to me and counsel the need for a Black direction, I accepted submissions by counsel for both parties that I should prelude my Black direction with a reminder of what I had said in the course of my oral and written directions about the necessity for the question which arises under s23A (1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), to be decided by reference to circumstantial evidence, albeit on the balance of probabilities.
2During the course of giving that prelude to my Black direction,(at page 107 summing up) the expression ""the presumption of continuity "".  What I said in context is follows:  
""There is something which I have not mentioned to you previously.  There is a principle of the law of evidence, referred to as the presumption of continuity.  If there is evidence showing before a salient event a condition exists, but no evidence at the time of the salient event that it exists, but after it there is evidence that it exists, then the tribunal of fact is entitled-not required or obliged-it is entitled to work on the basis of a presumption of continuity that the condition continues throughout, even though there is no direct evidence; that is to say, you don't have to call evidence that everyday he's got schizophrenia, because the evidence is that he had it as late the March 2010.  The evidence is he's got it now and has had it since he has been in prison.  Neither of the doctors suggested that it has been cured in the meantime and then he's got it again.  You are entitled to work on the assumption that he has had the condition throughout.  As I reminded you from recounting the arguments of Mr Brady, you are also entitled to rely upon the fact that it is untreated.  If it is untreated, it may well be symptomatic, but not necessarily.  Those are the approaches to the evidence you are entitled, but not required, to adopt and take."" 
3After I had completed my direction, including the Black direction, the learned Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions applied for a redirection to the effect that I withdraw the use of the expression ""the presumption of continuity"".
4I stood his application over for argument this morning to enable learned Senior Counsel, learned counsel for the accused, and me, to consider the transcript of my direction overnight.  When the Court resumed at 9:45 am for the purpose of hearing the application, learned Senior Counsel handed up a proposed redirection which I marked MFI 24.
5The proposed redirection, in substance, restates closely what I said by way of prelude to the Black direction but omits reference to the phrase, or, principle of, ""the presumption of continuity"".
6Senior Counsel argues that the phrase has the flavour about it of a direction that the onus of proof has shifted for the prosecution, contrary to the provisions of s 23A(4) which imposes it upon the accused.
7I must say, as acknowledged by counsel in argument, that at no time during the course of anything I said to the Jury yesterday did I refer to the elusive concept of shifting evidential onuses.  
8According to the authors of Cross on Evidence, Australian Edition, at [1125], the presumption of continuance is no more than a convenient way of describing a process of logic or reasoning involving the drawing of inferences from established facts. As such, it is a method of reasoning by which circumstantial evidence may be used to infer the existence of certain facts.  In R v Jeffrey Paul Noonan [2002] NSWCCA 46 at [19] per Bell J (Beazley JA and Smart AJ agreeing), in relation to an attempt to utilise the presumption for the purposes of identifying the accused as the driver of a vehicle held that:I am not able to accept that the retrospective operation of the presumption of continuance might be called in aid so as to admit of an inference being drawn beyond reasonable doubt
9However, this is not such a case.  I directed the Jury regarding the presumption of continuance on an issue that has to be proved on the balance of probabilities, not beyond reasonable doubt, as was the case in Noonan.  This is an issue on which the accused carries the onus on, effectively, the civil standard of proof. It is not an onus borne by the Crown on the criminal standard of proof.
10In Stanoevski v The Council of the Law Society of New South Wales [2008] NSWCA 93 Campbell JA (at [64-65])provided a succinct explanation of the way in which the presumption operated in a case that was to be decided on the balance of probabilities. Given that Stanoevski was a disciplinary matter regarding a legal practitioner, the consequences of which were grave, it has a quasi-criminal flavour and as such is especially relevant to the present case. His Honour said:
Those remarks are in my view directly applicable in the present case, where the Law Society had the onus of proving a negative proposition, namely that the Appellant was not a fit person to remain on the roll. The evidence it adduced of the various acts of professional misconduct in the period 1991 to 1993 were enough to establish that the Appellant was then unfit. A presumption of continuity would then arise, such that a court or tribunal would be justified in concluding that the Appellant was still unfit, unless the Appellant could produce evidence that gave reason for believing i. That is a totally conventional application of a shifting evidential onus. It involved no error of law by the Appeal Panel. 
There may be some subject matters concerning which the strength of an inference arising from a presumption of continuity attenuated with time until it totally disappeared. However, the subject matter to which the presumption of continuity is applied in the present case is the character of a person. It is not at all uncommon for aspects of the character of a person to persist over decades, frequently for someone's entire life. In my view, a tribunal of fact would be justified in using the extremely serious acts of professional misconduct in which the Appellant engaged in the period 1991 to 1993 as a basis for inferring that she was then unfit to practise, and that it was likely, notwithstanding that 15 years had passed, that she was still unfit to practise, unless the Appellant could produce evidence that gave reason for believing the situation had changed. [emphasis added]
11This passage demonstrates two pertinent points regarding the presumption of continuity and its application to this case.  The first is that it may be used in this case to raise the presumption that at the time of the events the accused suffered from the underlying condition of schizophrenia by virtue of the fact that there was extensive clinical evidence that he suffered from the condition prior to 2010, and also subsequent to his incarceration as a Justice Health patient. This body of evidence was referred to by the expert psychiatrists who have given evidence in this trial as the longitudinal history. 
12Applying the reasoning of Campbell JA, it seems that the presumption would operate to enable the Jury to infer that given the medical history of schizophrenia both before and after the offence, they could make a finding that the underlying condition then existed or subsisted at the time of the offence. This is of course different from the question whether it produced the relevant partial mental incapacity required by s 23A.
13Having said that, a finding that the underlying condition existed at that point in time would be a circumstance the Jury would be entitled to take into account in deciding whether they were satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the inference of mental incapacity was an inference more likely than any of the other available inferences in the case.
14Secondly, Campbell JA's reasoning regarding the strengths of the inference is relevant. In Stanoevski it was held that a person's character is something that can persist over decades, even a lifetime, thereby strengthening the presumption of continuity. 
15To my mind the presumption is strong in the present case.  Schizophrenia is a condition which is managed, not cured.  There is evidence that the accused demonstrated symptoms of the disease as early as 2002 and continues to do so today.  In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it could be a strong presumption that, despite the absence of any direct evidence that the accused suffered from the underlying condition on 25 March 2012, it continued to affect him. As I have said already, in directing the Jury yesterday I said nothing of the difficult and elusive concept of shifting evidential onuses.
16It seems to me that the direction I gave yesterday was entirely appropriate, given that the relevant onus of proof is on the balance of probabilities.  Moreover, I said nothing whatsoever to the Jury about any obligation, forensic or otherwise, of the Crown to rebut the inference.  What I said to the Jury made it entirely clear that what I was describing was a permissible mode of reasoning only.  I did not describe it as a presumption of a type that was either irrebuttable or could only be rebutted by the Crown discharging an affirmative duty to call evidence. 
17I remark, in passing, that the Crown did call Dr Allnutt, and as I have reminded the Jury, more than once, Dr Allnutt's evidence is that the question of mental incapacity is not decided solely by reference to the existence of the underlying disease, but depends upon the symptoms of it being active at the time of the event in question; the kicking of Mr Ray.
18In argument this morning, Mr Brady of learned counsel who appears for the accused has, with no disrespect, with some hesitation, indicated that he adheres to his approbation of yesterday afternoon, that my direction was appropriate.  But if I am of a different view this morning, he is content for me to read MFI 24 to the Jury as an accurate direction.
19Though normally I would hesitate to disagree with two such eminent, highly experienced members of the criminal bar on a question of the management of a criminal trial, and of what directions are appropriate to be given to a Jury, on this occasion I am going to.
20It seems to me that the direction I gave was correct, in law, for the reasons I have given. It did not have the vices that the Crown apprehend. To call the Jury back and to say to them that I withdraw everything I said yesterday, and then read something new to them, might engender confusion rather than clarity. I accept that the purpose of the Crown's proposed re-direction is, in part, to ensure clarity, as well as to expunge perceived error.
21This is the fourth day on which the Jury have been deliberating on a trial which lasted six days. It is clear from the questions that were asked yesterday that the Jury are finding it no easy task. I apprehend that if I recall what I said yesterday, and it is never an easy to successfully recall words once spoken, notwithstanding the admirable clarity of the suggested redirection, it is likely to lead to confusion and questions in their minds about whether their deliberations conducted this morning are to the point.
22Now, I acknowledge and accept the importance of ensuring that the Jury is properly directed. Even when the Jury has made its mind up and is anxious to return, it is the fundamental obligation of a trial Judge to stop them delivering a verdict until any error in a direction, previously given, has been corrected; or, any question yet unanswered is answered to enable the Jury the opportunity of continuing according to law, rather than terminating, their deliberations.
23But as I am conscientiously of the view the direction I gave yesterday was correct at law, and was accurate as to the factual matters I drew to their attention, a matter which counsel seem to agree with according to MFI 24, I decline the application to redirect the Jury for the reasons I have given.**********

		12 May 2014",2014-05-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763868,R v Norris [2014] NSWCCA 76,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY P: I agree with the reasons of R A Hulme J and with the orders his Honour proposes. I also expressly endorse his Honour's remarks at [3] in relation to the concession made by counsel for the respondent.

2R A HULME J: The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) appeals pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against a decision of a District Court judge to exclude certain evidence sought to be led in the trial of the respondent, Lee Robert Norris. 

3Counsel for the respondent, Mr C Smith, with his usual and commendable candour, has conceded that the appeal should be upheld. I am of the view that the concession is appropriate but it is necessary to explain why that is so.

The trial

4On 23 January 2014 the respondent was arraigned upon an indictment alleging that he committed an offence of sexual intercourse without consent upon a woman with knowledge that she was not consenting. He pleaded that he was not guilty and a jury was empanelled.

5On the fifth day of the trial, 30 January 2014, counsel who appeared in this Court with Mr Smith, objected to the admissibility of certain expert evidence which I will detail shortly. A voir dire was conducted; submissions were made; and the learned trial judge, his Honour Judge Lerve, upheld the objection and excluded the evidence. 

6The following morning the Crown Prosecutor successfully sought a discharge of the jury on the basis that the Director of Public Prosecutions was proposing to appeal against the judge's ruling. 

The issues in the trial

7The Crown case was that the respondent had sexual intercourse without the complainant's consent in the early hours of the morning of 20 April 2011 whilst she was asleep. She woke to find her clothing in disarray and felt wetness and discomfort in the area of her vagina and groin. She noticed fluid which she believed was semen. She complained to various people that she had been sexually assaulted. 

8The complainant was medically examined at about 6.45pm the same day. The examining doctor, Dr Hazelton, took vulval and vaginal swabs which he then applied to slides to produce smears. These were sent off to the NSW Forensic & Analytical Science Service (FASS) for analysis. The high vaginal and low vaginal swabs were combined and analysed. DNA was recovered which had the same profile as the respondent. It was a profile that was expected to occur in less than 1 in 10 billion individuals in the general population. There was no finding of DNA from any other contributor.

9The respondent was interviewed by police. He initially denied having sexual intercourse with the complainant at the relevant time. However, after he was informed of the results of the DNA analysis he said that he had engaged in sexual intercourse and had ejaculated ""inside her"" whilst not wearing any ""protection"", but he claimed that this was on 15 April 2011. 

The excluded evidence

10The Crown proposed to call evidence from Ms Sandra Trabuio, a forensic biologist at the Forensic Biology/DNA Laboratory of the FASS. Her proposed evidence was contained in two reports which were dated 13 and 16 January 2014.

11In the first report Ms Trabuio recorded that semen was detected on the high vaginal, low vaginal and vulval smears. DNA was recovered on the combined high and low vaginal swabs with a profile that was the same as the respondent and such a profile was expected to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 billion individuals in the general population. No objection was taken to Ms Trabuio giving that evidence.

12The second report set out her responses to two questions that had been posed. The first question concerned whether the smears placed on slides from the swabs taken by Dr Hazelton contained intact sperm. She provided a detailed response but, in short, it was in the affirmative. The second question was:

""Based on your training, knowledge and experience, is it likely that intact sperm located on a smear would be from an ejaculation more than 72 hours prior to the sample being taken?""

13Ms Trabuio's response was:

""Given my training, knowledge and experience it is my opinion that it is highly unlikely to obtain intact spermatozoa on vaginal or vulval smears greater than 72 hours after ejaculation occurred.

My opinion is supported by laboratory data as well as the article referenced below. [And she cited reference to an article published in the Canadian Society of Forensic Science Journal in 2011.]""

14Ms Trabuio gave evidence on the voir dire. In the course of that evidence she opined that where intact sperm are found then the time since ejaculation is most likely to have been within 24 hours, although it could have been up to within 48 hours which was the upper limit of the FASS laboratory results which she could recall in her 20 years of experience. The article referred to in her second report contained a review of literature on the subject within which there was reference to two cases in which intact sperm was found beyond the 48 hour period. In one of those cases, the period was 72 hours.

15In cross-examination, Ms Trabuio said that the sperm found on the slides was not analysed and so she would be unable to say whether or not it matched any particular person. She had earlier explained in her evidence in chief that the laboratory do not routinely analyse the slides for DNA because the smears on them are derived from the accompanying swabs which are analysed. She said, ""We look at the smear for the amount of sperm and the corresponding swab is used to examine for DNA"". 

The basis of the objection

16It was submitted by counsel for the respondent that the evidence concerning the time since ejaculation of the sperm located on the smear slides was inadmissible because:

(a)it was not specialised knowledge based on her training, study or experience: s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW); 

(b)it was irrelevant because Ms Trabuio could not say anything about who the source of the sperm was; and

(c)the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent: s 137 of the Evidence Act.

17The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the evidence was admissible because:

(a) The opinion was the product of Ms Trabuio's training, study and experience as it was based on her involvement in the analysis of sexual assault investigation kits for some 20 years and her opinion was supported by the results of the literature review referred to in the Canadian article; and

(b) The only rational inference to be drawn from a consideration of all the evidence given by Dr Hazelton and Ms Trabuio was that it was the respondent's sperm that was on the smear slides.

The judgment

18The trial judge delivered an ex tempore judgment (and that is understandable given it was the afternoon of the fifth day of the trial and he had a jury waiting in the jury room). 

19His Honour accepted that the evidence was opinion evidence that was admissible under s 79 of the Evidence Act: ""I am satisfied that she does have the experience to give an opinion about the age of sperm"". 

20Reference was then made to the evidence of the sperm on the smear slides not having been analysed and Ms Trabuio not being able to say from whom it emanated. His Honour referred to the Crown's reliance upon circumstantial evidence to show that what was on the slides was the same as what was in the swabs. He then said:

""Despite the experience of the analyst I am of the opinion the objection Ms Feiner takes on [the] issue of relevance is made good."" 

21His Honour ruled that the evidence contained in Ms Trabuio's second report of 16 January 2014 was excluded.

The appeal

22As earlier observed, the appeal is brought pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That provision gives the Crown a right to appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence but only if it eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case. 

23The Crown submitted that the judge erred by failing to take into account the evidence in the Crown case touching upon the smear slides at its highest and upon the assumption that the jury would act upon it. If it could be established that the sperm on the smear slides was that of the respondent, the evidence of Ms Trabuio of the time since ejaculation of that sperm was relevant because it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings: s 55(1) of the Evidence Act. The ""fact in issue"" was whether the respondent had intercourse with the complainant in the early hours of the morning of 20 April 2011 as opposed to, as he claimed, on 15 April 2011.

24It was submitted that the only rational hypothesis was that if the vaginal swabs bore DNA that emanated from the respondent, then the semen found in the smears, which were created from the swabs, also emanated from the respondent. The Crown case on this aspect was circumstantial but there was no alternative hypothesis available. The conclusion for which the Crown contended was inevitable.

25As I have earlier mentioned, counsel for the respondent in this Court conceded that the trial judge had erred. 

26It was accepted that one of the essential elements of the offence the Crown was required to prove, that the respondent had sexual intercourse with the complainant on 20 April 2011, had been put in issue by the accused saying in a police interview that they had sexual intercourse but claiming that it occurred five days earlier.

27It was also accepted that the evidence excluded by the trial judge rationally affected the assessment of the possibility that the DNA could have come from an act of intercourse between the respondent and the complainant on 15 April. It was conceded that the jury could use the evidence to exclude that possibility. If the jury did so then the Crown's assertion that the respondent's DNA was found because he had sexual intercourse with the complainant on 20 April would be left uncontradicted.

28Mr Smith then turned in his written submissions to the question as to whether the exclusion of the evidence ""substantially weakened"" the Crown case. This required an examination of the whole of the evidence in the prosecution case and a consideration of the relative importance of the evidence in question in that context.

29Mr Smith, like senior counsel for the Director, provided a summary of the evidence in the Crown case. He conceded that in the context of that evidence, it was ""difficult to argue against the submission that the exclusion of the evidence substantially weakened the prosecution case"". 

Determination

30There is no need to digress into any exposition of the principles relating to the manner in which this Court determines an appeal brought pursuant to s 5F(3A). This is a clear case of error having been established in the manner set out in the Crown submissions and conceded on behalf of the respondent. 

31It is also clear, in my view, that the exclusion of the evidence substantially weakened the prosecution case. The evidence in question has the potential to remove any reasonable doubt about whether the respondent's semen was deposited on the occasion when the Crown contends he had intercourse with the complainant when she was incapable of being aware, and therefore incapable of consenting. The alternative hypothesis arising from the claim made by the respondent in his police interview can be negated if a jury accepts the inference arising from the combined effect of the evidence of Dr Hazelton and Ms Trabuio. It is well open to the jury to accept that evidence and the inference arising from it. 

32The decision of the trial judge excluding the evidence should be vacated.

33The notice of appeal included in the list of orders sought that this Court should make a ruling that the evidence is admissible. However, in light of the fact that the jury had been discharged and a further trial remains to commence, the Crown abandoned that aspect.

Order

34I propose the following order: 

1. Appeal allowed.

2. The ruling of his Honour Judge Lerve on 30 January 2014 excluding the evidence of Ms Sandra Trabuio in relation to the detection of spermatozoa in smears made during the examination of the complainant on 20 April 2011 and her opinion as to the possible period between ejaculation and the creation of the smears is vacated. 

35BELLEW J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2763875,Kazzi v R [2014] NSWCCA 73,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: I agree with Button J that the appeal must be dismissed, for the reasons his Honour has succinctly given: no ""Muldrock error"" is disclosed on a fair reading of the earlier decision of this Court when resentencing the appellant in 2008. By ""Muldrock error"", I mean the imposition of a sentence which, by reason of what was determined in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, discloses material error (see for example Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10 at [2] and [7]). Because the nature of the present ""appeal"" is a little unusual, and would give rise to novel issues had the position been otherwise, I describe the position below.

2The orders made by this Court on 21 April 2008, on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions, quashed the sentence imposed by the District Court and imposed a new sentence, pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). After Muldrock was delivered, that new sentence was the subject of an application pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).

3Section 78 provides that ""an application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person"". There is no reason to exclude from the operation of s 78 sentences imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Indeed, the nature and the history of this and cognate powers to hold an inquiry into a conviction or sentence (see Patsalis v Attorney General for New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 343 at [8] and [17]-[20]) support it being given a wide and unfettered construction as to the convictions and sentences to which it applies. Neither party contended otherwise. 

4Section 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) provides that after considering an application under s 78, but only if ""it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case"", there may be either an inquiry pursuant to s 79(1)(a) or a referral pursuant to s 79(1)(b). It is established that sentencing which arguably discloses Muldrock error answers the description of a ""doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstances in the case"": Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383. Latham J formed the opinion that there was such a ""doubt or question"", and granted the application on 19 December 2013, and this Court was told that her Honour had referred the matter to this Court. 

5Two things may be noted about her Honour's decision. First, her Honour was not exercising judicial power, but was making an administrative determination. As much is established by Patsalis. Secondly, the question presented by s 79 was not to determine whether there was Muldrock error, but merely whether there was a ""doubt or question"" as to that issue, such that it warranted a further hearing in this Court, with the benefit of full submissions from the parties. 

6Section 79(1)(b) provides:

""(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion: 
...
(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912."" 

7That paragraph is to be read with s 86, which relevantly provides:

""On receiving a reference under section ... 79(1)(b), the Court is to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and that Act applies accordingly."" 

8The closing clause of s 79(1)(b) (""to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912"") and s 86 are directed to this Court. Together, they give rise to a new statutory creature, whose incidents closely resemble those of an appeal created by the Criminal Appeal Act. 

9Appeals are, of course, themselves creatures of statute. There is no difficulty in the Legislature providing that, where the opinion required by s 79 has been formed and the ""whole case"" is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, it be determined as if there were an appeal. Sections 79(1)(b) and 86 are required (or else something to their effect would need to be implied), for otherwise this Court would lack jurisdiction. Sections 5(1)(c) and 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act, read with the definition of ""sentence"" in s 2, only create an appeal from a ""sentence"" imposed by the court of trial. The critical effect of s 79(1)(b) read with s 86 in this case is that the sentence imposed in 2008 by this Court pursuant to s 5D(1) is taken to be a sentence supporting a further appeal.

10Hence, the position is as described by Bathurst CJ in A reference by the Attorney General for the State of New South Wales under s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 re the conviction of Frederick Lincoln McDermott [2013] NSWCCA 102; 303 ALR 143 at [22]: 

""The words 'as if' [in s 86], in my opinion, indicate that the Court is to treat the appeal as one properly brought and which it had power to deal with under s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act.""

11It is established by Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14 (where these provisions and many of the authorities on them were considered by RA Hulme J) that the appellant does not require leave, notwithstanding the time that has elapsed. It is not necessary to express a view on what flows from the fact that it is the ""whole case"" which is the subject of the referral, words which have a lengthy history in legislation throughout Australia and in the United Kingdom, as may be seen from Mallard v R [2005] HCA 68; 224 CLR 125 at [10]-[12]. Although it may not have been necessary to do so, the appellant filed a notice of appeal, whose sole ground (after being amended at the commencement of the hearing) was that there was Muldrock error in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal delivered on 21 April 2008, and the parties' written and oral submissions were confined to that issue.

12The appellant's written submissions (filed with leave on 24 March 2014) made three submissions consequential upon the nature of this ""appeal"". First, they contended that, if the resentencing discretion were to be re-exercised, s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act would not apply (because the present ""appeal"" is not a ""prosecution appeal""); with this the Crown agreed. Nevertheless, the submissions contended that any resentencing discretion should be exercised as if it were a Crown appeal - in particular invoking what was said in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [62] as to the practice for ""the appellate court to impose a substituted sentence towards the lower end of the range of available sentences"". Thirdly, they contended that the appellant should not be disadvantaged by any more recent sentencing practices, by reference to R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368 at [31]. In light of the absence of Muldrock error, it is not necessary to express a view on any of those contentions. 

13Finally, it may be noted that the appellant was charged with offences arising under State law, and no federal questions arose during the course of the trial or the appeal. Neither the District Court in 2007 nor this Court in 2008 was exercising federal jurisdiction. Nor is this Court exercising federal jurisdiction today. Again, it is not necessary to express a view on how these provisions operate (and indeed, whether they operate at all) upon convictions and sentences made in the exercise of federal jurisdiction, which as I presently see it is a large question; see Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2002] HCA 47; 211 CLR 119 and, especially, the analysis by Basten JA in Lodhi v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 433 at [47]-[64].

14BUTTON J: This is an appeal against sentence that comes before the Court by way of a referral pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). As a result, leave to appeal is not required: Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14.

15The foundation of the appeal is the proposition that, in upholding a Crown appeal brought some years ago, this Court proceeded in accordance with R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, and thereby offended against the principles subsequently enunciated in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

Chronological background

16The course of the matter may be summarised as follows.

17On 19 October 2007, the appellant was sentenced in the District Court of New South Wales by Williams DCJ. He was dealt with for seven serious offences against the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). Due to the nature of the single ground of appeal, there is no need to provide any great detail about the facts of the offences.

18To state the offences succinctly: count one was an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely 196 grams of cocaine. The appellant supplied the drug in exchange for between $3,500 and $4,200. The maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 15 years. There was no applicable standard non-parole period.

19Count two was an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. It pertained to 338 grams of methylamphetamine, of which the appellant supplied 140 grams at $2,100 per ounce (that is, for approximately $10,500). The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years, and there was an applicable standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

20Count three was an offence of supplying a prohibited drug. It related to 196 grams of cocaine that the appellant had supplied in three lots for a total of $18,000. The maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 15 years. There was no applicable standard non-parole period.

21Count four was an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for life, and there was an applicable standard non-parole period of 15 years. In short, the appellant agreed to supply two kilograms of cocaine for $187,500 per kilogram. The transaction fell through due to the inability of the purchaser to complete it, and not through any reticence on the part of the appellant.

22Count five was an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. Again, the applicable maximum penalty was imprisonment for life, with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. This count related to 2.892 kilograms of methylamphetamine that the appellant stored for later supply.

23Count six alleged the supply of a prohibited drug, namely 139.7 grams of cocaine that the appellant stored for supply. The maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 15 years. There was no applicable standard non-parole period.

24The seventh and final count alleged the supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. Again, the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. In a nutshell, the appellant purchased 990 grams of cocaine for $155,000 and sold it for $175,000 (though that profit was to be shared between the appellant and another).

25His Honour determined that the role of the appellant was ""clearly nearer the top than the bottom"" of the hierarchy engaged in the ongoing supply of large quantities of prohibited drugs, and found that the objective seriousness of the offences fell ""just below"" mid-range.

26Turning to subjective matters, the appellant was aged 32 years at the date of sentence. He received a 30% combined discount for his plea of guilty and his assistance to the authorities. His Honour found that he was a drug user, but his criminality was undoubtedly organised, and his resultant lifestyle was lavish. His Honour described his criminal record as ""minor"" and considered that it ""really has no bearing on the matters before [the Court]"".

27As a result of subsequent events, there is no need for me to detail the particular sentence imposed for each offence, or its position in the overarching sentencing structure. It is sufficient to say that his Honour imposed a total head sentence of imprisonment for 8 years with a total non-parole period of 6 years.

28The Crown appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. On 28 March 2008, that appeal was upheld. James J (with whom Mason P and Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) agreed) held that the appeal should be allowed. The central portion of the judgment of James J is as follows:

[54] With regard to offences 2, 4, 5, and 7 there are statutory non-parole periods. Although the Court of Criminal Appeal held in Way at 184 [68] that statutory non-parole periods are to be taken as intended for a middle range case where the offender was convicted after a trial, the Court said at 192 [122] that, even where there are reasons for not imposing a standard non-parole period for an offence such as that there was a plea of guilty, ""the standard non-parole period can properly take its place as a reference point or benchmark or sounding board or guide post"".

[55] In the present case the sentencing judge did not assess the level of objective seriousness of the offences, taken individually. However, his Honour did categorise the offences generally as being ""just below"" the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Having regard to this assessment by the sentencing judge of the objective seriousness of the offences, I consider that his Honour did fail to take into account the standard non-parole periods to the extent which is required by Way even where there has been a plea of guilty.

[56] In sentencing the respondent the sentencing judge also had to pay ""careful attention"" to the maximum penalties set by the legislature for the offences. Markarian v R (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at 1056 [31]. In the present case the maximum penalty for offences 4 and 5 was imprisonment for life and the maximum penalty for the other offences was imprisonment for 15 years or imprisonment for 20 years. The sentencing judge did correctly state the maximum penalties for the various offences in his remarks on sentence but the sentences set by his Honour suggest that he did not pay careful attention to the maximum penalties for the offences.

[57] After taking into account the objective facts of the offences, including the role of the respondent and the quantities of prohibited drugs involved, my assessment of the level of objective seriousness of the offences which would not be below the level found by the sentencing judge, the maximum penalties for the offences and the standard non-parole periods for offences 2, 4, 5 and 7 and even after allowing the respondent a combined discount for his pleas of guilty and assistance of the same order as that allowed by the sentencing judge, I have concluded, after paying due regard to the principles stated in Wall [R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42], that this Court should hold that some of the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were manifestly inadequate and that the overall sentences were manifestly inadequate to punish the respondent for the totality of his criminality. [Emphasis added]

29The result was that the sentences imposed by Williams DCJ for counts one, three, and six were retained. The sentences for counts two, four, five, and seven were quashed, and new sentences imposed.

30For counts one, three, and six of supplying a prohibited drug, fixed terms of imprisonment for 18 months, to commence on 23 February 2006 and expire on 22 August 2007, were maintained.

31On count two, supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, a fixed term of imprisonment for 4 years, to commence on 23 February 2007 and expire on 22 February 2011, was imposed. 

32On count seven, supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, a fixed term of imprisonment for 5 years to commence on 23 February 2008 and expire on 22 February 2013, was imposed.

33On count four, supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months was imposed, the non-parole period to commence on 23 February 2009 and expire on 22 August 2016, and the balance of term to commence on 23 August 2016 and expire on 22 February 2019.

34On count five, supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months with a balance of term of 3 years 6 months was imposed, the non-parole period to commence on 23 February 2010 and expire on 22 August 2016, and the balance of the term to commence on 23 August 2016 and expire on 22 February 2020.

35Annexed to this judgment is a diagram that seeks to set out the sentencing structure in a readily comprehensible form.

36It can be seen that the total head sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal was 14 years, to commence on 23 February 2006 and expire on 22 February 2020, with a total non-parole period of 10 years 6 months to commence on 23 February 2006 and expire on 22 August 2016.

37Returning to the chronology, on 5 October 2011 the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen was handed down.

38On 19 December 2013, Latham J granted an application for referral to this Court. That was on the basis that her Honour experienced a ""doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case"" that warranted referral: s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.

Ground of appeal

39The single ground relied upon by the appellant was as follows:

The Court of Criminal Appeal erred in its consideration of the standard non-parole period in light of Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120 with respect to counts 2, 4, 5 and 7.

Submissions

40Counsel for the appellant submitted at first that there was some question as to which sentences - those of Williams DCJ or those of the Court of Criminal Appeal - were the subject of this second appeal. On reflection, he accepted that the sentences imposed by Williams DCJ for the offences that carried a standard non-parole period had been quashed, and that this appeal must be directed to the sentences imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal.

41He submitted that the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal was consistent with those portions of R v Way that had been overruled in Muldrock v The Queen; that therefore the sentences of the Court of Criminal Appeal had been imposed on an erroneous basis; and that this Court would be satisfied that lesser sentences are warranted in law and proceed to resentence.

42The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the passages that formed the basis of the intervention of the Court of Criminal Appeal did not reveal any error. In particular, she submitted that nothing was said in the paragraphs that I have extracted from the judgment of James J that was inconsistent with the principles subsequently promulgated in Muldrock v The Queen.

43After the hearing, detailed written submissions were provided by both parties about the nature of an appeal by way of referral when it is an earlier judgment of this Court that is said to demonstrate error. Those written submissions were helpful; but in light of the view that I have taken of the basal question of whether the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal shows the error of which the applicant complained I will not refer to them further.

Determination

44To summarise the changes wrought by Muldrock v The Queen with succinctness, in R v Way it was held that, in imposing a sentence after trial for offences that attracted a standard non-parole period, a court was required to determine whether there were reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. The first step was to conduct an assessment of the seriousness of an offence by reference to one falling within the mid range of objective seriousness. The second step was to consider whether there were circumstances that militated against the imposition of the standard non-parole period. In Muldrock v The Queen the High Court held that, whether the proceedings on sentence had been preceded by a trial or a plea of guilty, a standard non-parole period (along with the applicable maximum penalty) played the role of a guidepost for a sentencing judge: at [27]. That was a significant alteration to the interpretation that had pertained for some years of the statutory provisions that created the system of standard non-parole periods.

45However, during the years when R v Way was binding authority on sentencing judges, sentencing after a plea of guilty had been entered did not call for the rigidly structured approach. So much was clear from the judgment of this Court in R v Way. At [68] - [71] it was said: 

[68] Although there is nothing in Division 1A of Part 4 that expressly says so, the standard non-parole periods in the Table must also be taken as having been intended for a middle-range case where the offender was convicted after trial. This follows from the fact that factor (k), being one of the mitigating factors specified in s 21A(3) which is to be taken into account as a matter which might justify a departure from the standard non-parole period, is ""a plea of guilty by the offender (as provided by s 22A)"". A plea of not guilty can never be an aggravating factor.

[69] If the standard non-parole period had been intended to apply to cases where there had been a plea, then it may be safely inferred that such circumstance, which s 22 says ""must be taken into account"" would have already been factored into the assessment of the appropriate period. It would, in any event, be contrary to long-standing sentencing practice, save in exceptional circumstances, for there to be no differentiation in the setting of a non-parole period, between matters resolved by plea, and at trial. 

...

[71] Notwithstanding, a plea will, in most instances, have a utilitarian value such as to attract some level of discount. Absent the specification of separate standard non-parole periods, we are of the view that the periods specified in the Table should be understood as having been specified for sentences imposed for midrange cases after conviction at trial. We do not understand the Crown to be contending for the contrary. [Emphasis in original]

And at [122] it was said: 

In this approach [that is, the approach to be adopted once it has been determined that there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period] the standard non-parole period can properly take its place as a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guidepost, along with the other extrinsic aids such as authorities, statistics, guideline judgments and the specified maximum penalty, as are applicable and relevant. In particular, it can have a direct relevance as a reference point to be compared with the sentence which is provisionally reached after an assessment has been made of the relative seriousness of the subject offence, and of the various aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as any other subjective factor that may be present, including in particular the fact, if it be the case, that the offender entered a plea of guilty. In that regard the sentencing judge will need to keep in mind that the standard non-parole periods were framed upon the assumption that the case was determined at trial and that s 22 of the Act contemplates that the fact of a plea will attract a discount.

46So much was recognised by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen. At [23] of the judgment of the Court it was said:

The Court [of Criminal Appeal] held that the standard non-parole period only applies to sentencing for an offence after conviction at trial. This is because the Sentencing Act provides that a sentencing judge may impose a lesser sentence on an offender to take into account the fact of a plea of guilty. [Footnotes omitted]

A footnote within that paragraph referred to in R v Way at [71].

47In short, although Muldrock v The Queen effected significant changes to sentencing practice in New South Wales with regard to offences attracting a standard non-parole period after a trial, the same cannot be said about sentencing practice with regard to such offences after a plea of guilty.

48That view is reflected in a number of decisions of this Court since Muldrock v The Queen. In Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 it was said at [26]:

... Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre-Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick.

49Turning to analyse the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal in this matter, it can be seen that, at the end of [54], James J spoke of the standard non-parole period as being ""a reference point or benchmark or sounding board or guide post."" 

50At [55], the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the learned sentencing judge had failed ""to take into account the standard non-parole periods to the extent which is required by Way even where there has been a plea of guilty.""

51At [56], the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the learned sentencing judge had not paid sufficient attention to the maximum penalties applicable to the offences for which the appellant was to be sentenced.

52In short, the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal does not demonstrate any inconsistency with Muldrock v The Queen. Rather, it proceeded upon principles of sentencing with regard to sentencing after a plea of guilty that were first promulgated in R v Way and that have survived Muldrock v The Queen. The Court spoke of the standard non-parole period as being a guidepost, just as Muldrock v The Queen did three years later. The foundation of the success of the Crown appeal was the finding by the Court of Criminal Appeal that inadequate regard had been paid by the sentencing judge to that guidepost, along with the maximum penalty. It was not the finding by the Court of Criminal Appeal that the sentencing judge had failed to adopt the (subsequently disapproved) rigid approach.

53It follows that I do not consider that any error has been established in the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal in upholding the Crown appeal in 2008.

54Finally, in his written submissions counsel for the appellant noted that the Court of Criminal Appeal had made an error by imposing fixed terms for offences that were subject to a standard non-parole period; namely counts two and seven. That was contrary to s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (NSW). He did not, however, submit that there was any utility in correcting that error many years later. Nor did he seek to be heard against the submission of the Crown that to do so would be otiose, in light of the expiry of the last of those sentences over a year ago, and the fact that any such adjustment could have no effect on the sentence structure in general, or on the date of expiry of the total head sentence and total non-parole period in particular. 

55Neither party having submitted that that ineffectual error should be corrected, I do not consider that this Court should proceed to do so.

56No error having been demonstrated in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, I propose the following order:

(1)Appeal against sentence dismissed.

57RS HULME AJ: I agree with Button J.

		12 May 2014",2014-05-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763881,Miles v R [2014] NSWCCA 72,"Judgment
1SIMPSON J:  I have read in draft the judgment of Button J.  I adopt his Honour's account of the relevant facts and his statement of the relevant principles of law concerning the grant of an extension of time to appeal.  I agree that grounds 1, 2 and 5 are without substance. 
2I wish to record my own approach to grounds 3 and 4.
Ground 3
3The direction the subject of this ground of appeal was given in the context of a relatively brief recital of the evidence concerning each count, interspersed with reference to counsel's arguments.  The direction was:
""Concerning the allegation by [the complainant] that the accused sexually assaulted her on 1 July 2005, that is at the hotel in Bundanoon and the fact that she did not initially make any complaint about that, the accused through [his counsel] has argued that the absence of such complaint to anyone to whom she might reasonably be expected to complain, is inconsistent with the conduct of a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted and through [counsel] is saying that you should therefore regard her evidence that she was sexually assaulted without her consent on that occasion as false, that is by virtue of the fact that she did not immediately complain to anybody.  
... [His Honour then gave conventional directions about the absence of complaint, and made reference to relevant evidence and continued.]
... So in the light of her not having made a complaint at the time in respect of this assault at the hotel, it is then a matter for you to determine what weight you should give to her evidence in respect to this first count.  Now in respect to the second and third counts, that is on 5 July you have heard evidence that she complained immediately, she told friends that took her to the police station where she made her statement about what occurred on 5 July 2005 and she was then taken to the Wollongong Hospital.  
The Crown says that the fact that she complained in those circumstances shows a consistency of conduct on the part of [the complainant], in that she complained to people whom she might reasonably be expected to complain if she had been sexually assaulted and she did so the Crown says almost immediately.  The Crown says in relation to that complaint concerning those two assaults that such is the conduct of a truthful person who had been sexually assaulted, in other words the evidence is relevant to the credit of the complainant as a witness, in that it may increase the weight that you give to her evidence in respect to these assaults alleged to have occurred on 5 July.  Implicit in the Crown's argument is that you should also look at this complaint being made by [the complainant] against the background of the suggestions that were made to her that for a period of what must have been in excess of six months there had been continual consensual sexual intercourse between the two of them.  Now if that was the case why did she go to complain on this occasion if it was just another act of consensual sexual intercourse."" (italics added)
4It is the italicised last sentence that provides the foundation for this ground of the proposed appeal.  Almost immediately after that direction, the short adjournment was taken.  Counsel for the applicant took the opportunity to raise with his Honour the direction.  The transcript records the following exchange in the absence of the jury:
""[Counsel for the applicant]:  Before the jury returns your Honour may I just clarify a point?  The last thing your Honour mentioned was expressed in these terms, why would she complain on this occasion if --
His Honour:  No, I said the Crown's case is that you look at the background of the consensual intercourse and if that be the case why would she complain following the events of the 5th, is that right, Ms Crown?
Crown prosecutor:  I didn't actually make that submission to the jury your Honour for the reason I was concerned that any such submission might raise the question of motive to lie and breaching the authorities that say it's improper for the Crown to make that suggestion to the jury.  
His Honour:  On the question of complaint though.  You see the question of complaint on this second occasion, you say this goes to the credibility, don't you?  
Crown prosecutor:  I didn't actually make a submission about that.  
His Honour:  No, but the Crown's case would be, would it not?  See, what is complaint?
Crown prosecutor:  Yes, in terms of the immediate complaint to the police and creditability, yes that's implicit in my argument but I didn't raise the question of why would she lie.
His Honour:  What direction do you seek [counsel for the applicant]?
[Counsel for the applicant]:  I didn't seek a direction.  I didn't hear that the Crown made that submission.  I hear the Crown now saying it's implicit in her submissions, so I don't suppose there's any damage done.  But I think it needed clarifying.
His Honour:  Do you want me to clarify that in any way?
[Counsel for the applicant]:  No, I think 'least said, soonest mended' your Honour.  If there is any issue that arises out of that I think it's fairly small but I could not be said that the Crown made that submission and for the reason that Madam Crown actually states.  
His Honour:  This is quite a different situation where the authorities indicate that the Crown or anybody else can't make a submission of you know why would a person lie.  This goes to the creditability of this witness in that she made a complaint to those persons that she might have expected to make the complaint.  She did so on this day and that could be viewed against the background of the suggestions that were made to her that there was this six months consensual sexual relationship.  And as a result of that, if that was the case, you have a situation of her nevertheless complaining about those acts that took place on 5 July and those are matters which go to her credit.
[Counsel for the applicant]:  Yes, I accept they do go to her credit your Honour.  I think I'll say nothing further now.
His Honour:  Just think about it.  
[Counsel for the applicant]:  Yes, I will, yes.
His Honour:  And if there is some type of redirection you want me to give I would.""  
The jury then returned to the court and the summing up continued.
5The following morning, having apparently listened to the sound recording of the summing up, the trial judge raised the matter again.  He told counsel that his view was that the direction did not ""even remotely suggest any reversal of the onus of proof"".  He invited counsel to make any submission as to the direction.  Counsel disclaimed any submission that the direction reversed the onus of proof.  His complaint, he said, was that the direction attributed to the Crown prosecutor a submission that had not been made.
6The complaint that is now made is that the emphasised passage contravened the rule stated in Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1.  The principle in Palmer arose in the context of a trial of charges of sexual offences.  In that case, the accused gave evidence.  More than once, in cross-examination, he was asked to explain, or to propose a reason, why the complainant might fabricate the allegations.  His short answer was that he had no idea why she had said what she had said.  He confirmed that he could think of no reason why she would make up her allegations.  
7A question had been put to the complainant in cross-examination expressly suggesting ""payback"" or revenge as her motive.  The High Court noted that cross-examination is permissible and evidence is admissible to establish that a complainant has a motive to make and persist in false allegations.  The High Court quoted the decision of this Court in R v F (1995) 83 A Crim R 502 at 511-512, where Gleeson CJ said:
""The 'central theme' of the case, according to the trial judge, could be found in the question, 'Why would the complainant lie'?  That is a question, often left unspoken, which usually hovers over cases of this nature ... Whilst that question, sometimes spoken, sometimes unspoken, is often of great practical importance, it is never 'the central theme' of a criminal trial.  At a criminal trial the critical question is whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable doubt.  Just as the law does not require the Crown to prove a motive for the criminal conduct of the accused, the law does not require the accused to prove a motive for the making of false accusations by a complainant.""
Preceding that, the High Court said: 
""7  It is one thing to permit cross-examination of a complainant in order to elicit, if possible, a motive to lie.  It is another thing to permit cross-examination of an accused to show that an accused cannot prove any ground for imputing a motive to lie to the complainant.  A complainant knows whether he or she has a motive to lie and, as a motive to lie is a fact that may be proved to impeach the complainant's credit, the complainant may be asked about it.  And evidence may be given by other witnesses of events from which such a motive may be inferred.  But the fact that an accused has no knowledge of any fact from which a motive of the kind imputed to a complainant in cross-examination might be inferred is generally irrelevant.  In general, an accused's lack of knowledge simply means that his evidence cannot assist in determining whether the complainant has a motive to lie, but if the facts from which an inference of motive might be drawn are facts that the accused would know if they existed, his lack of knowledge could be elicited to disprove those facts.
8  If it were permissible generally to cross-examine an accused to show that he has no knowledge of any fact from which to infer that the complainant has a motive to lie, the cross-examination would focus the jury's attention on irrelevancies, especially when the case is 'oath against oath'.  In such a case, to ask an accused the question: 'Why would the complainant lie?' is to invite the jury to accept the complainant's evidence unless some positive answer to that question is given by the accused ...""
8The passage in the direction of which complaint is now made was not precisely of the kind the subject of the decision in Palmer, although it could be seen as bearing some relationship.  However, the impact of the direction needs to be considered in the light of the conduct of the trial.  
9The applicant was charged with three offences, one allegedly committed on 1 July 2005, two committed on 5 July 2005.  The detail of the complainant's allegations are to be found in the judgment of Button J.  Put shortly, she alleged:
that she first met the applicant in July 2004 while they were both students at Wollongong University in residence (she as an overseas student);that she regarded him as a platonic friend and wanted no more intimate relationship;that he made plain that he sought an intimate and romantic relationship with her;that he offered her work which she accepted;that, on 30 June 2005 they travelled together to Canberra to lodge papers concerning her working visa;that they then visited a friend of the applicant's in Canberra, and left to drive to Wollongong at about 9.00 or 10.00pm;that the applicant said that he was feeling tired and drove to a hotel in Bundanoon;that the applicant booked a room, and persuaded the complainant to join him in the room (she having opted to remain in the car);that, shortly after her entering the room, the applicant sought sexual engagement with her, which she resisted;that they both fell asleep;that on their waking the next morning the applicant committed a sexual assault upon her, without her consent, and over her resistance;that the complainant made no report to any authority of this incident;that the applicant then drove her to Wollongong;that she saw the applicant about three days later, when the applicant apologised and promised that there would be no repetition of the incident;that, on 4 July, the complainant began working for the applicant (who by then was living in an apartment off the university grounds), in his apartment;that the applicant picked her up to take her to work in his apartment (in his bedroom);that, on 5 July, the applicant again picked up the complainant from her accommodation at the university to take her to work at his apartment;that, at about midday that day, the applicant forced her onto the bed and committed sexual offences upon her;that the complainant made immediate complaint of this event, first to a friend and then to police.
Some corroboration of the complainant's allegations was provided by the applicant's two flatmates. 
10The complainant was medically examined.  Medical evidence supported her account of the non-consensual nature of the intercourse.
11The applicant did not give evidence in the trial.  His response to the complainant's allegations was put through cross-examination of the complainant.  It was clear, from the cross-examination, that the applicant acknowledged that sexual intercourse with the complainant had taken place on both 30 June - 1 July, and 5 July, and that he claimed that it was on each occasion consensual.
12The cross-examination was both lengthy and detailed.  The cross-examination of the complainant was, in its entirety, to the effect that, for about six months, the complainant and the applicant had had a consensual romantic and sexual relationship.  It was put to the complainant that she had, on a number of occasions, willingly engaged sexually with the applicant, in the back of cars, at the beach and at other places.  She consistently denied each proposition put to her.  By way of support for the applicant's case, a number of photographs of the applicant and the complainant together were tendered.  The proposition was that these photographs were consistent with, and evidence of, a relationship of the kind put to the complainant.
13In the circumstances, however, that the complainant consistently refuted the suggestions put to her, and that the applicant did not give evidence, there was no evidence of the relationship the applicant claimed to have existed. 
14Nevertheless, it was quite plain to the jury that that applicant's case was that, over a six month period, the complainant had willingly engaged in sexual activity with him, but that, on 5 July, for some reason, she falsely complained that the sexual intercourse was not consensual, and later made a similar complaint that the sexual activity of 1 July was non-consensual.  
15In his final submissions, counsel for the applicant repeatedly asserted that the complainant had lied about her relationship with the applicant.  He relied upon the photographic evidence to support his repeated assertions that the relationship had been as claimed by the applicant.
16The issue for the jury to resolve was whether the Crown had proved to the requisite criminal standard that the complainant had not consented to sexual intercourse with the applicant on each of the two occasions the subject of the charges.  Given the manner in which the trial was conducted, that called for some examination of the complainant's conduct.  Strictly speaking, counsel's questioning of the complainant could not provide any evidentiary foundation for the jury to accept that she had had a pre-existing sexual relationship with the applicant.  But the reality of a jury trial is that such persistent and detailed questioning must have left an impression on the jury.  That impression was reinforced by the way counsel for the applicant addressed the jury.  The address was premised upon the complainant having been a willing participant.  Counsel drew support from the photographs.
17The direction given did not contravene the principle stated in Palmer, because it did not (directly) ask the applicant to propose a motive for the complainant to fabricate her allegations.  But it was closely allied to the principle, because it did invite the jury to accept the complainant's evidence unless some positive answer could be given to the question, whether proposed by the applicant, or divined, in some way, by the jury.  
18The task of the jury was to weigh up the competing positions of the parties: on the one hand, that the complainant had never had consensual sexual intercourse with the applicant and on the two occasions of which she had complained, the sexual intercourse had been non-consensual; and, on the other hand, the case put on behalf of the applicant, that, after a long period of willing sexual engagement with him, the complainant had made false allegations.  The jury were entitled and obliged to make an assessment of whether there was a reasonable possibility that the latter was the true position.  The judge was entitled and obliged to draw to the jury's attention that their task was to consider whether there was such a reasonable possibility.  That, no doubt, was why trial counsel agreed that the issue concerned the complainant's credibility.  
19It was unwise to frame the direction in the form of a question, because to do so had the capacity to cast an onus on the applicant, and invite the jury to accept the complainant's evidence unless some positive answer to the question (""Why did she falsely complain?"") could be found.  A direction, however, to consider whether there was a reasonable possibility that the complainant had engaged in consensual sexual activity with the applicant over a six month period before making a false complaint, would not have that capacity, and would have been a perfectly proper direction. 
20The significance of the direction has also to be seen in the context of the entire summing up, and in the light of the discussion that immediately ensued.  The comment made by his Honour was but one sentence in a comprehensive summing up.  Counsel for the applicant plainly did not see any major problem with it.  
21Although, as I have concluded, the direction could have been better framed, all it did was to draw attention to the competing positions of the parties, and articulate what must have been in the jury's mind.  The directions with respect to the onus and standard of proof made it clear that no onus lay on the applicant.  In my opinion, this ground of appeal, if an extension of time were granted, would have little prospect of success.
Ground 4
22Although ground 4, as formulated, focuses upon what is called evidence of ""flight"", the written submissions in support of the ground stray far from that evidence, and draw in a variety of aspects of the evidence of the applicant's conduct on and after 5 July from which the jury might have inferred that the applicant was acting out of a consciousness of guilt.
23There was, indeed, a significant body of evidence to support the contention that the applicant behaved as he did because he was conscious that he had committed the offences on 5 July.  The evidence showed that he washed the clothes he had been wearing on that day, and the sheets that had been on the bed on which the offence was alleged to have been committed.  He left the premises without warning, leaving personal items.  He did not return, did not contact his landlady, and abandoned his university course.  He attempted to make contact with the complainant.  None of this evidence was disputed.  
24""Flight"" is an established category of evidence that comes under the rubric ""consciousness of guilt"".  The first proposition advanced in support of ground 4 is that that evidence (that the applicant left his home and effectively disappeared) ought not to have been admitted.  No argument was directed to that proposition.  I can think of no sensible argument that could conceivably support it.  The second proposition is that the directions in respect of that evidence were inadequate.  The directions were:
""Now the Crown has suggested to you by reason of the accused absenting himself from his unit on the 5 July, after [the complainant's] friends came and took her away and she went to the police station, the fact that the accused absents himself from that unit and then is not seen for several months, the Crown invites you to draw an inference as to a consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused by him so doing.
[His Honour then referred to the cross-examination of the complainant to the effect that she and the applicant had had regular consensual sex.]
The Crown says therefore, if that were so why would not the accused have remained in his unit, what was the reason for him in effect taking flight from that unit.  The Crown's case is the only rational inference that you could draw from those circumstances is an inference of guilt on the part of the accused, that that demonstrates a consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused.  Now that is a matter for you members of the jury whether you accept that that is the only rational inference to be drawn in those circumstances.  I have to say to you though, that in considering that scenario, people do not act always rationally.  It may be that conduct of this sort can possibly be explained in other ways; there may be reasons for him leaving that unit and not returning, other than a realisation of guilt on his part.  Some people may do things out of panic in order to perhaps escape from some unjust accusation.  But nevertheless members of the jury, that is a classical matter where it is for you to determine what weight you will give to all of that evidence, it is a matter for you as to whether or not you draw the inference that the Crown seeks.""
25The directions required with respect to evidence of consciousness of guilt stem from cases in which the Crown has relied upon lies allegedly told by an accused person following the events giving rise to the charge or charges: Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193.  They are adaptable to a variety of other forms of conduct also said to have the effect of demonstrating a consciousness of guilt.  An important element of the direction is to draw the jury's attention to the need for the conduct in question to demonstrate a consciousness of guilt of the offence charged, and not some other offence or discreditable conduct.  The direction given touched only lightly upon that.  In some circumstances it may be that such a direction is insufficient.  However, the direction given must be seen in the light of the whole of the evidence in the trial, and the conduct of the defence case.  On the evidence in this case it is quite impossible to conceive of any other offence or conduct that could have caused the applicant to absent himself.  It is not to be forgotten that the applicant's case, put through cross-examination of the complainant, was that he and the complainant had engaged in a long course of consensual sexual contact.  It could hardly be inferred that he possibly absented himself out of shame or embarrassment at having had consensual sexual intercourse with the complainant.  No other reason for his sudden departure was postulated, and none suggested itself on the evidence.  While an accused person bears no onus of proof, the applicant can hardly rely on the absence of a direction that would have not the slightest basis in the evidence.  Had the jury been given a more complete direction, it could have led it into speculation about possible alternative reasons for the applicant's sudden departure.  An accused person is no more entitled to rely upon speculation than is the Crown.
26The written submissions on behalf of the applicant then sought to draw a distinction between the evidence of the applicant's sudden departure and his prolonged absence from the scene of the alleged crime - his home - and his so-called flight from police.  This latter was a reference to the applicant's failure to respond to messages left on his mobile telephone by police.  The Crown prosecutor made reference to this in her address.  Having referred to the applicant failing to respond to messages from his landlady, she then said:
""Did he say that to throw her off the trail in case she might tell the police where he was.  She told him that the police were looking for him and she asked him if he'd contacted them.  She didn't say that he asked her why the police wanted to speak to him.  What did he say.  All he said was 'I don't know anything about that'.  If somebody told you the police were looking for you wouldn't you want to know why.  Wouldn't you ask them why.  He knew why.  She told him to contact the police and he didn't call the police.  Ask yourselves why not ... Detective Rosete left a message for him on 26 July identifying himself, telling him he was wanted by police in relation to the sexual assault allegation and asking him to hand himself in to Ulladulla police station.  But he didn't do that.  He checked his voicemail three times that day, and Detective Rosete said that that was sometime between 2pm and 5pm that he'd left the message.  The accused's voicemail was retrieved at 2.04pm 2.32pm and 5.19pm.  And there were a number of phone calls made to other mobiles but no call made to Detective Rosete.  And then the phone was switched off for 18 hours.  He didn't attend the police station.  The police found him where he was on 20 September ...""
The first part of this submission is unexceptionable.  It was legitimate to suggest that, if the applicant was not conscious of having committed an offence, he would have asked why the police were attempting to contact him.  The second part of the submission, however, concerned with his failure to respond to police messages, is in a different category.
27I agree with Button J that such conduct is analogous to the refusal of an accused person, or suspected person, to answer questions put by police.  It is a standard and correct direction that, having regard to the right to silence, no adverse inference can be drawn from such a refusal.  The Crown prosecutor ought not to have put to the jury what she did.  It may have been preferable for the trial judge to have directed the jury accordingly.  However, counsel who appeared for the applicant at trial apparently saw no difficulty in what had been said.  The evidence of the applicant's failure to return police calls was a small part of the evidence of his post 5 July conduct.  This ground of appeal, if leave were granted, also would have little prospect of success.
Conclusion 
28In order to be granted an extension of time to appeal, it is necessary that an applicant establish some reasonable prospect of mounting a successful appeal.  Section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act (NSW) sets out the basis on which an appeal may succeed.  An appeal against conviction is to be allowed if this Court is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on any of the following grounds: 
(i)  that it is unreasonable; or 
(ii)  that it cannot be supported; or 
(iii)  that there has been a wrong decision of any question of law; or 
(iv)  that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice.
29The applicant has not demonstrated any prospect of establishing any of these.  There is no basis for a conclusion that the verdicts were unreasonable, or could not be supported on the evidence; nor that there was any wrong decision of a question of law.
30The applicant has sought to show that, for a variety of reasons, there was a miscarriage of justice.  I agree with Button J's reasons for concluding that grounds 1, 2 and 5 must fail.  The most the applicant has succeeded in doing is to show two minor irregularities in the summing up, neither of which was of sufficient moment to be the subject of complaint by his counsel at trial.  In my opinion the applicant has no prospect, if granted an extension of time, of establishing any miscarriage of justice.  The conviction was soundly based.  An extension of time to appeal should therefore be refused.
31HARRISON J:  I agree with Simpson J. 
32BUTTON J:  This is an application for an extension of time pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (""the Act"") with regard to an appeal against two convictions entered against the applicant by Judge Conlon SC in the District Court of New South Wales after a trial by jury.  The convictions relate to two offences of sexual intercourse without consent, knowing that the victim was not consenting, brought pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The application for an extension of time is necessary because the application was heard in April 2013 with regard to convictions that were founded upon verdicts of guilty that had been returned by the jury in July 2007.
History
33It is convenient at this stage to set out a brief history of the matter.
34The indictment upon which the applicant was arraigned alleged three offences.  Count one alleged that the applicant had sexual intercourse with the victim, knowing that she was not consenting, at the Southern Highlands township of Bundanoon on 1 July 2005.  Penile/vaginal sexual intercourse founded the count.  Count two alleged the same offence, said to have occurred at Keiraville (a suburb of Wollongong) on 5 July 2005.  Digital/vaginal sexual intercourse was alleged.  Count three alleged the same offence, said to have occurred at the latter location on 5 July 2005.  Penile/vaginal sexual intercourse founded the count.
35The trial commenced with the arraignment of the applicant on those three counts on 25 June 2007.  Verdicts were returned on 5 July 2007.  The jury acquitted the applicant of the first count, but returned verdicts of guilty on the second and third counts.  The applicant was taken into custody on that day.
36On 1 November 2007, his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with regard to counts two and three.  The sentence for count two was less than and wholly concurrent with the sentence for count three, and need not be discussed further.  With regard to count three, a head sentence of imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of five years to date from 30 June 2007 was imposed.  That operative non-parole period expired on 29 June 2012.  The applicant was released from custody on that date.
37I turn now to summarise the evidence of events between the imposition of sentence on 1 November 2007, and the hearing of the appeal on 12 April 2013.  These events are recounted in two affidavits of the applicant, one of them hand-written.  The applicant also gave oral evidence about the events before this Court.  Some parts of the history were amplified by his counsel from the Bar table.  Finally, the Crown Prosecutor provided the court, without objection or dispute, with a document summarising events between those two dates.
38On 8 September 2008, a notice of intention to appeal was filed on behalf of the applicant in the Registry of this Court.  It is noteworthy that that original notice of intention to appeal was over eight months out of time.
39On 30 September 2008, the solicitor then acting for the applicant informed the Registry by letter that the applicant wished to withdraw his notice of intention to appeal immediately.
40Almost 2 years later, on 31 August 2010, the Registry received a further notice of intention to appeal and an application for extension of time signed by the applicant and dated 26 August 2010.
41On 13 September 2010, the Registrar wrote to the applicant confirming receipt of the second notice of intention to appeal; advising him that the previous abandonment did not prevent an application for leave to appeal out of time; and, as the applicant had indicated that he wished to have the assistance of Legal Aid, informing him that the Registrar had asked the appropriate solicitors of that office to contact him.
42On 5 December 2011, the Registry received a third notice of appeal dated 11 November 2011, along with an application for an extension of time.  The applicant prepared that document.
43On 10 May 2012, the Registrar conducted a call-over of the matter.  The applicant appeared for himself.  The hearing of the application was set down for 26 September 2012.
44On 13 September 2012, at another call-over before the Registrar, the applicant appeared for himself again, and the hearing date was confirmed.
45On 25 September 2012 (that is, the day before the hearing that had been set down several months previously), counsel who appeared for the applicant filed a notice of appearance on the hearing.  The following day, he appeared on behalf of the applicant and applied to have the hearing date vacated, in light of his late involvement.  This Court granted that application.
46On 26 October 2012, counsel filed amended grounds of appeal and written submissions.
47On 8 November 2012, a new hearing date for the appeal was fixed for 12 April 2013.  The hearing proceeded on that day.
48In his oral and written evidence, the applicant sought to explain the various periods of delay apparent from the above review as follows.
49Soon after being taken into custody on the day of the verdicts, the applicant was diagnosed with a mental illness, and, according to him, medicated against his will.  The result of the medication was that he lost his ability to think clearly.  His position was that it was the adverse effects of the medication that caused him to abandon his appeal in late September 2008, not a considered decision to abide by the convictions.
50As for the delay between September 2008 and the reactivation of the matter in August 2010, the applicant explained that he did not cease taking the medication until late 2009.  He also stated that it took some time for his mind to clear and for him to return to the view that he should appeal against the two convictions.
51As for the delay between October 2010 and December 2011, the applicant explained that the receipt of an advice from counsel organised by Legal Aid with regard to the merit of any appeal took quite some time.  After its receipt, he had a falling out with the lawyers whom Legal Aid had arranged for him.  Eventually, he dispensed with their services and decided to appear for himself.  Again, those logistical steps took quite some time.
52In summary it can be seen that, at a hearing in April 2013, this Court was being asked to quash two convictions founded on guilty verdicts that had been returned several months short of six years before the hearing.  And the offences of which the applicant was found guilty had been committed several months short of eight years before the hearing.
53At the hearing, the Crown Prosecutor opposed an extension of time being granted, whilst accepting that there remains a discretion in this Court to do so.
54In light of the passage of so many years, and even accepting that the evidence of the applicant may go some way to explaining it, is clear that the principles with regard to applications for extension of time in this Court require close consideration in this matter.
Principles with regard to extension of time
55The time limits on making an appeal against a conviction or sentence contained in s 10 of the Act reflect the principle of finality in litigation: see R v Unger [1977] NSWLR 990 at 994-5.  
56Bearing that principle firmly in mind, there are a number of factors that the court must consider in deciding whether it is in the interests of justice to grant an extension of time to appeal.  These factors were set out by this Court in the recent decision of Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [53] in the context of an application for an extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence on the basis of a so-called ""Muldrock error"".  The approach adopted in Abdul v R has been held to extend to all cases in which an extension of time is sought in order to bring an appeal: Alpha v R [2013] NSWCCA 292.
57The first factor is the length of the delay, and whether there is any satisfactory explanation for the delay: R v Beattie [2000] NSWCCA 201 at [17]; McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174.
58The second factor is the interests of all parties involved or affected, including victims and their families, witnesses called in the proceedings, and the Crown (representing the community), as well as the interests of the applicant.  In cases in which the delay is considerable, the undesirability of denying the expectation of the community, witnesses, victims, and the families of victims that criminal proceedings have been concluded is a significant consideration to be taken into account: Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [38].  Regard should also be had to whether the passage of time will detrimentally affect the administration of justice, particularly where there is a proposed retrial: Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262; 205 A Crim R 138 at [23].
59The third and final factor is whether a substantial injustice would result if the application for an extension of time to appeal were to be refused.  That involves considering the merits or prospects of success of the proposed appeal: R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [30].  It can be done in a more summary fashion than would be the case on the hearing of the appeal, so as not to defeat the purpose of the time limit: Etchell v R at [25].
60In this case the length of the delay, the fact that the applicant had served his non-parole period and been released ten months before the hearing, and the fact that any retrial would almost certainly be impractical, powerfully argue against leave being granted.
61I turn to consider in more detail whether a substantial injustice would occur if leave were refused.  In order to do so, I shall analyse the prospects of success of each of the grounds more concisely than I would if there were no question of an extension of time.  I shall also analyse the considerations that underpin the application of the proviso in s 6 of the Act.  That is because I consider that questions of whether a ""substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"" can inform whether, on an application for extension of time, an applicant can point to a ""substantial injustice"".  
62I adopt that approach in general conformity with the approach of Leeming JA (with whom Johnson and Hall JJ agreed) in Outram v R [2013] NSWCCA 329.  In that application for an extension of time in a conviction appeal, his Honour regarded the strength of the Crown case as a relevant factor to be taken into account with regard to whether the accused had established that there would be a substantial injustice if the application were refused: at [12]-[18], [49], and [55].
63It is also the case that the analogue of the proviso in s 6(1) of the Act with regard to appeals as to sentence, namely s 6(3), is commonly considered with regard to applications for extension of time in the latter setting: see, for example, Abdul v R at [55] - [59].
Crown case
64It is convenient to summarise the Crown case in general chronological form.
65The victim, a woman aged 24 years at the time of the offences, came to Australia in July 2004 and was studying at a university in Wollongong.  She and the applicant met in about November 2004 when they were both residing in student accommodation on campus.  He sought a romantic relationship; she wished to remain nothing more than friends.
66In April 2005, the applicant contacted the victim and informed her that he had started a business to do with the Internet.  She accepted his offer of a job that would, he informed her, found an application for a temporary working visa on her part.  On 27 May 2005 they signed a contract of employment.
67On 1 July 2005, after a late-night departure by car from Canberra, the two of them ended up sharing a hotel room in the Southern Highlands township of Bundanoon.  Whilst in that room, according to the victim, the applicant assaulted her by climbing on top of her whilst she was on the bed.  When she resisted and yelled out, she claimed that he placed his hand over her mouth.  The struggle came to an end when the applicant fell asleep.  The victim fell asleep as well. 
68When she awoke the next morning a further struggle ensued.  Again the applicant placed his hand over the mouth of the victim.  He then pulled her pants off and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina (count one).  The victim was struggling continuously. 
69I interpolate that it is the case, of course, that the applicant was acquitted of the count arising from this alleged incident.  It is necessary to recount the allegation, however, in order to understand the first proposed ground of appeal.
70After the sexual assault, the applicant drove the victim home.  She told no one about what had happened.  No injuries were observed to her by any person.  She saw the applicant three days later, and he apologised to her.  On the same occasion she accepted his offer of employment. 
71The evidence of the victim was that she commenced work on Monday 4 July 2005 in the applicant's bedroom in the apartment that he shared with two other men.  On her first day of work nothing out of the ordinary occurred. 
72However, her evidence was that on the following day at about lunchtime the applicant entered the room in which she was working.  He held her arms, kissed her hard, and put his hand over her mouth to prevent her from crying out.  A lengthy struggle ensued between the two of them.  Eventually, the applicant manhandled the victim onto the bed and pulled her pants off.  The victim was in fear for her life.  The applicant inserted one of his fingers into her vagina (count two).  Subsequently he inserted his penis into her vagina (count three), causing her pain.  Throughout the incident the victim was yelling and shouting, including words that made it clear that she was not consenting. 
73Two men with whom the applicant shared the apartment gave evidence for the Crown about the events of that day.
74Mr Qu gave evidence that he left the apartment around 9 AM and returned at about 12 midday.  On his return he did not see the applicant, but noted that his bedroom door was closed.  About half an hour later, he heard a female voice say ""Please don't do that.  I don't want that, please.""  The speaker sounded agitated, and the words were uttered in a loud tone.  He heard those words being said repeatedly and continuously.  Mr Qu also heard a noise that sounded to him like that of a person being smacked.
75Mr Dale gave evidence that at about 1 PM he saw that the door of the bedroom of the applicant was slightly open.  When Mr Dale made some noise to indicate that he was home, the door of the room of the applicant closed.  Mr Dale heard some noises coming from the bedroom that he assessed as being of a sexual nature.  He also heard a female voice call out from the bedroom ""Stop.  No, I can't do that.""  Mr Dale heard those words said twice.
76The victim gave evidence that the sexual intercourse ended with what she interpreted as ejaculation.  The applicant asked the victim whether she wished to take a shower.  She left the bedroom and entered the bathroom.  From there she telephoned a friend and asked him to come and collect her.  Once she arrived home, she informed her flatmates of what had occurred.  They took her to a police station where she was spoken to by police.  From there she was conveyed to Wollongong Hospital and medically examined.
77The medical examination revealed a large number of injuries to the person of the victim There was a bruise on the left side of her neck; a bruise to the lower side of her left cheek; a graze on the side of her forehead; a laceration to her right lower lip associated with a bruise; a dark red bruise inside the back of her mouth; a reddish white area above a lower wisdom tooth; two red bruises on the top of her left buttock; some bruises on her legs; bruises on her arms; and multiple superficial abrasions on the back of her left shoulder.
78The examining doctor gave evidence that the injuries observed were consistent with the history given by the victim.  She also gave evidence that, in her opinion, none of the bruises observed showed signs of being more than 18 hours old.
79Later in the evening of 5 July 2005, the police executed a search warrant at the apartment.  The applicant was not present.  It was observed that the bed in the bedroom of the applicant had been stripped.  Located in the washing machine of the apartment were wet items that included bed sheets, a pillow case, underwear, pants, and shirts, including a grey shirt.  Mr Dale informed the police that the applicant had worn that item earlier in the day.
80On 6 July 2005 the victim provided a statement to police in relation to the events of the previous day.  The police took photographs of the numerous injuries that I have described.
81Meanwhile, on 5 July 2005, the applicant had left his rented room never to return.  On 7 July 2005, the lessor changed the locks and stored all of the furniture and personal belongings that the applicant had left behind when he departed.
82A large amount of evidence was given of events after 5 July 2005, with particular focus upon the movements and behaviour of the applicant.  It included evidence of mobile phone records of the applicant that suggested that he was moving around different parts of New South Wales.  It also showed that a large number of calls were made from a mobile phone associated with the applicant to a mobile phone associated with the victim.  On 18 July 2005 the applicant failed to attend a meeting that he and the victim had arranged, and at which the police intended to arrest him.
83On 26 July 2005, the applicant telephoned his lessor to enquire about the fate of his property and to ask how much rent he owed.  She asked the applicant whether he knew that the police were ""looking for [him]"".  His reply was that he ""[didn't] know anything about that"".  The lessor said, in effect, that he should go to the police and clear things up.
84On the same day, a police officer telephoned the mobile telephone number of the applicant.  He left a voicemail message telling the applicant that he was wanted by police, and asking him to hand himself in at Ulladulla Police Station.  The applicant did not return the call, and did not hand himself in. 
85Police also attended the university at which the applicant was studying.  University records showed that, after 5 July 2005, the applicant abandoned his studies.
86On 21 September 2005 the applicant was arrested.  The police saw that his car contained bedding.  On arrest the applicant exercised his right to silence. (In fact, he had answered some questions, but their admission was rejected by his Honour, and the matter was left to the jury on that basis.)
87It was not until March 2007 that the victim gave the police a statement with regard to the events of 30 June and 1 July 2005.
88In short, the Crown case with regard to counts two and three included the direct evidence of the victim; her immediate complaint; the sounds and utterances heard by the two flatmates of the applicant coming from his bedroom at a time when the bedroom door was closed; the multitude of injuries to the person of the victim; the sudden departure of the applicant from his home, where he left a number of personal items; and, finally, his conduct in stripping the bed and seeking to wash the sheets from it, along with the shirt he had been wearing on the day of the sexual contact in question.
Defence case
89Counsel who appeared for the applicant in this Court was not counsel who appeared for him at trial.  To differentiate between them I shall refer to the latter as ""defence counsel"".
90No evidence was called in the defence case.  Nor was the character of the applicant raised in the Crown case by defence counsel, either generally or in a specific respect.
91The defence case was that the applicant and the victim indeed had sexual contact on 1 July and 5 July 2005, but that all of it was with the consent of the victim.  She firmly denied that suggestion.
92In cross-examination of the victim it was put to her that she and the applicant enjoyed a long-standing consensual sexual relationship for many months before July 2005.  That proposition was also firmly denied.  A number of photographs were tendered in support of the proposition that the two of them were on good terms for quite some time.  The victim was brought to the position of accepting that the relationship between the two of them had featured more socialising than she had first detailed.  It was also put to the victim that, when she had had consenting sexual intercourse with the applicant, she was in the habit of yelling ""No, no, no"".  Again, that was robustly rejected. 
93In cross-examination of Mr Qu and Mr Dale, defence counsel demonstrated that, although having heard the noises from the bedroom, neither of them was sufficiently concerned to do anything about them.  
94In cross-examination of the officer in charge of the investigation, it was suggested that there were sundry deficiencies in their investigation of the matter.  Again, that proposition was denied. 
95In his final address, defence counsel bluntly submitted that the jury would find that the victim had lied about the extent of her relationship with the applicant, and that, as a result, the jury could not accept her as a witness of truth with regard to the allegations. 
Grounds
96I proceed to analyse, in a concise way, the degree to which each of the grounds supports the proposition that, if the extension of time were not granted, a substantial injustice would occur.
97The applicant's proposed grounds of appeal were as follows:
(1)The trial miscarried because tendency evidence, introduced through the ex officio indictment, was not identified and made the subject of direction.
(2)The verdict for count one (not guilty) and the verdicts for counts two and three (guilty) are rationally irreconcilable, rendering the guilty verdicts unsafe.
(3)The Learned Trial Judge's directions were in error in relation to complaint, in that:
(a)Directions in relation to defence counsel's suggestions were misplaced in the circumstances and had the potential to confuse the jury.
(b)The Learned Trial Judge inadvertently invited the jury to speculate upon why the complainant might lie if she was not to be believed.
(4)
(a)Evidence was admitted in relation to flight which ought not to have been, or if admitted should have been accompanied by adequate direction from the Learned Trial Judge.
(b)His Honour erred in his directions as to flight
(i)in not differentiating between flight from the applicant's flat and flight from the police.
(ii)in not giving an adequate ""Edwards"" direction.
(iii)misapplying the suggestions of counsel in relation to flight.
(5)The trial miscarried because the applicant was not given the benefit of raising his good character in a particular respect, that is that he had no convictions for assault or sexual or indecent assault.
Ground 1 - The trial miscarried because tendency evidence, introduced through the ex officio indictment, was not identified and made the subject of direction.
98This ground is founded upon the proposition that the trial judge should have warned the jury that they were not to use the evidence that underpinned count one as tendency evidence in support of the evidence that underpinned counts two and three.  It mentions the fact that count one had not been the subject of a committal, but nothing turns on that.
99Its prospects of success need to be considered in the context of a number of aspects of the conduct of the trial as a whole.
100First, his Honour explicitly directed the jury in the summing up to consider each count separately:
""... in relation to each of these charges you should consider them separately, the evidence separately in relation to each charge.  So in each case the crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to the particular act of the accused.  If the crown fails to do this then the accused is not guilty.  If you are however satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did have sexual intercourse with [the victim] and also that she did not consent in relation to each charge, then you mustgo on to consider the third and last element, namely, whether the accused knew that she was not consenting.."" 
""Well members of the jury, you will recall no doubt that I told you, that you of course have to consider the evidence in relation to each count separately.""
101Furthermore, in reviewing the evidence in the trial, his Honour said:
""I should say, members of the jury, of course all the evidence that I have read to you in relation to the Bundanoon Hotel, that is all relevant of course to the first charge on the indictment.""
102Secondly, the transcript of the final addresses records that a portion of the final address of the Crown Prosecutor was ""unable to be transcribed"" due to the master tape being ""no longer available"".  Nevertheless, I consider that it is established from the final address of defence counsel, the summing up, and the discussions of legal matters in the absence of the jury (all of which are available in their entirety) that the Crown never relied upon the evidence underpinning count one as supporting counts two and three, whether as tendency evidence, coincidence evidence, context evidence, relationship evidence, bad character evidence, or anything else.  Counsel for the applicant did not contend to the contrary.
103Thirdly, counsel for the applicant invited the attention of this Court to the decisions of Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; 171 A Crim R 463 at [80] and DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 206 at [29] - [31].  But I regard those judgments as inapposite.  That is because they speak of the need for a warning not to use evidence as tendency evidence when evidence of uncharged acts has been admitted in order to provide a context for charged acts, or to set out the relationship said to surround the charged acts.  That may be sharply contrasted with the position that pertained here.  As I have said, the evidence underpinning count one was not relied upon by the Crown in any way with regard to counts two and three.
104Fourthly, no application was made by defence counsel for any such direction or warning.
105Fifthly, a warning in accordance with the requirements of R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82 was given by his Honour as follows: 
""""Well members of the jury, you will recall no doubt that I told you, that you of course have to consider the evidence in relation to each count separately.  And consequent upon that I can tell you that if you had a reasonable doubt concerning the credibility of the complainant's evidence in respect of one count, then you can take that into account when assessing her credibility in relation to the other counts"" 
106Counsel for the applicant submitted in this Court that the giving of such a warning by his Honour undermined the direction that the evidence in support of each count needed to be considered separately.  
107The short answer to that submission is that, whilst it may be true that a ""Markuleski direction"" conceptually undermines the discrete consideration of each count, it does so in a way that markedly favours the interests of an accused person.  One can readily see that, in the circumstances of this trial, an adverse determination about the credibility of the victim with regard to count one could have powerfully assisted the applicant with regard to counts two and three.  In any event, if his Honour had not given such a direction, that would have constituted an appellable error.  Of course, defence counsel at trial did not resist the giving of the direction.
108Sixthly and finally, for his Honour to have directed the jury not to adopt a process of reasoning that had not been mentioned by either party, and that was flatly contradicted by the explicit direction his Honour had given about the separate consideration of the evidence with regard to each count, may well have tempted the jury to embark upon the very process of reasoning prohibited by any such direction.  In other words, I consider that any such direction may very well have disadvantaged the applicant.
109In short, the direction contended for was not called for by the Crown case that was presented; was adequately dealt with by an explicit direction of his Honour; was not sought by counsel for the applicant; was not supported by authority; and may very well have disadvantaged the applicant.
110The prospects of success of ground one do not support an extension of time being granted.
Ground 2 - The verdict for count one (not guilty) and the verdicts for counts two and three (guilty) are rationally irreconcilable, rendering the guilty verdicts unsafe.
111This ground focuses upon the acquittal on count one and the verdicts of guilty on counts two and three.  Counsel for the applicant submitted that they were rationally irreconcilable and invited the attention of this Court to the judgments in Mackenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 at 367 and R v Markuleski at [78]. 
112Whilst accepting that there were differences between the evidence that supported count one and the evidence that supported counts two and three, counsel for the applicant embarked upon a detailed analysis of the evidence in support of the latter two counts in an effort to demonstrate that, on close consideration, the evidence in support of counts two and three was not as strong as it may have appeared at first blush.
113The difficulty in that approach is that the exercise that this Court undertakes with regard to such a ground is not to engage in a detailed analysis of the strength or weakness of the Crown case with regard to the count or counts of which an appellant has been convicted.  Rather, the test may be stated succinctly as being whether ""there is a logical and reasonable basis for sustaining the differentiation that the jury drew"": MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [89].
114I consider that there is a plethora of evidence that provides a rational reconciliation of the fact that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of proof of count one, but was so satisfied with regard to proof of counts two and three.  In a number of separate ways, the evidence was markedly stronger with regard to counts two and three than it was with regard to count one.
115First, complaint was delayed by many months with regard to count one.  It was immediate with regard to counts two and three.
116Secondly, after the incident that gave rise to count one the victim maintained her working relationship with the applicant.  That was not the case with regard to counts two and three.
117Thirdly, there were no witnesses who could give evidence touching upon the sexual contact that founded count one.  In particular, there were no witnesses who could shed any light on whether or not the sexual intercourse that underpinned count one was consented to by the victim.  In stark contrast, one witness gave evidence with regard to counts two and three of hearing sounds that were consistent with the infliction of force by the applicant upon the person of the victim during the sexual contact that founded the latter two counts.  Furthermore, two witnesses gave evidence of having heard things said by the victim at the same time that were, on any sensible analysis, strongly suggestive of a lack of consent on her part.
118Fourthly, no witness gave evidence of having seen the victim injured immediately after the sexual contact that underpinned count one.  Again in stark contrast, when the victim was examined by a doctor shortly after the sexual contact that underpinned counts two and three, she was found to have a very large number of injuries to her person.  And those injuries were generally consistent with the actions of the applicant of which she had made prompt complaint.
119Fifthly, there was no evidence with regard to count one that was suggestive of a consciousness of guilt on the part of the applicant.  That was not the case with regard to counts two and three.  I shall turn to discuss that proposition in more detail when I come to discuss the fourth proposed ground of appeal.
120I reject the proposition that there was no rational basis for the differentiation on the part of the jury between count one and counts two and three.
121Again, the prospects of success of this ground do not support granting an extension of time.
Ground 3 - The Learned Trial Judge's directions were in error in relation to complaint, in that:(a) Directions in relation to defence counsel's suggestions were misplaced in the circumstances and had the potential to confuse the jury.(b) The Learned Trial Judge inadvertently invited the jury to speculate upon why the complainant might lie if she was not to be believed.
122This ground is founded upon things said by his Honour in the summing up when directing the jury about the issue of evidence of complaint.
123The background was that, as I have said, defence counsel had put to the victim in cross-examination that, far from the two incidents that founded the counts in the indictment being the only sexual contact that had occurred between the victim and the applicant, there had been numerous consenting sexual encounters between the two of them over the preceding months.
124His Honour said to the jury: 
Now in respect of the second and third counts, that is on 5 July you have heard evidence that she complained immediately, she told friends that took her to the police station where she made her statement about what occurred on 5 July 2005 and she was then taken to the Wollongong Hospital.
The crown says that the fact that she complained inthose circumstances shows a consistency of conduct on thepart of [the victim], in that she complained to people whomshe might reasonably be expected to complain if she hadbeen sexually assaulted and she did so the crown saysalmost immediately.  The crown says in relation to thatcomplaint concerning those two assaults that such is theconduct of a truthful person who had been sexuallyassaulted, in other words the evidence is relevant to the credit of the complainant as a witness, in that it may increase the weight that you give to her evidence in respect to these assaults alleged to have occurred on 5 July.  Implicit in the crown's arguments is that you should also look at this complaint being made by [the victim] against the background of the suggestions that were made to her that for a period of what must have been in excess of six months there had been continual consensual sexual intercourse between the two of them.  Now if that was the case why did she go to complain on this occasion if it was just another act of consensual sexual intercourse. [Emphasis added] At a later stage of the summing up his Honour said: 
Members of the jury when a question is asked of a witness it is not the question that becomes the evidence.  It's not the question that is the evidence.  All of the suggestions of prior consensual acts of sexual intercourse were met with firm denials from [the victim].  Therefore there is no evidence before you that there was ever any prior consensual acts of sexual intercourse.  See if I wasto say to one of the male members - this is just a hypothetical example, if I was to suggest to one of the male members of the jury, ""look you beat your wife don't you?"".  The person says, ""No I don't beat my wife"", ""I'm suggesting to you that over the last period of six months you've beaten your wife on about five or six occasions?"" ""No that's not right?""  ""I'm putting to you that you get angry, you've got a temper problem and you beat your wife?""  And he says, ""Well I don't know what you are talking about"".  The mere putting of the question is not evidence that he beats his wife.  For you to accept that proposition you'd need to hear some evidence from other quarters in relation to whether the wife was beaten or not. 
His Honour also said:
""... the situation here is members of the jury that there is no evidence before you that there were any prior consensual acts of sexual intercourse and you should put those suggestions out of your mind and ignore them.""  
125Defence counsel took issue with the first of the statements that I have extracted in the absence of the jury.  At first, his concern seemed to be (the position is not entirely clear) that what his Honour had said could lead the jury to ask themselves why the victim would complain on this occasion if what she was saying was not true.
126In extended discussion, the Crown Prosecutor disavowed having made any such argument to the jury, due to her concern to avoid infringing the prohibition contained in Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1 against asking a jury to consider why a prosecution witness would lie.
127Eventually, defence counsel adopted the position that his real concern was that, in truth, his Honour had put an argument to the jury that did not emanate from the Crown Prosecutor.   He submitted that, if there were any arguments in favour of the applicant that were implicit in his submissions, his Honour should put those to the jury as well.  Defence counsel sought neither a discharge of the jury nor a redirection with regard to what his Honour had said.
128At the hearing of the application in this Court, counsel for the applicant submitted that, taken together, those portions of the summing up suffer from two deficiencies.  The first was said to be that the jury may well have been confused by his Honour informing them that, on the one hand, questions are not evidence; and, on the other hand, purporting to recount an argument of the Crown that was founded on the idea that the credibility of the victim could be bolstered by way of the rejection of the propositions of fact underpinning questions asked of the victim by defence counsel.
129Secondly, he submitted that, although what his Honour said could be summarised as ""Why would she falsely complain?"" as opposed to ""Why would she lie?"", nevertheless it fell foul of the reasoning in Palmer v The Queen.
130The Crown Prosecutor in this Court emphasised that neither basis of the ground had caused defence counsel any concern.  She submitted that the argument that was being recounted by his Honour was, on analysis, really nothing more than the unexceptional proposition that one can look to the complaint to see whether it was consistent with the allegation.  She further submitted that the extract from pp 62-3 of the summing up that I have provided above would have resolved any confusion in the minds of the jury about the use that could be made of the questions of defence counsel.  
131I consider that this ground has some merit, and supports an extension of time being granted.  That is so for a number of reasons.
132First, I consider that it was regrettable that, in summarising the arguments of the Crown, his Honour put to the jury a submission that had not, in fact, been made by the Crown Prosecutor, and that was disavowed by her in the absence of the jury.  Apart from anything else, those who appear for accused persons at trial should be in a position in final address to answer the explicit submissions made by the Crown Prosecutor.  They should not have to deal pre-emptively with implicit arguments of the Crown that could be put to the jury in the summing up.
133Secondly, it is true that juries are routinely directed that questions asked by counsel are not evidence.  On the other hand, in very limited circumstances, propositions put to a witness by counsel for a party can be relied upon as being evidence of instructions given by the party to his or her counsel: see, for example, R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 688-690; RWB v R; R v RWB [2010] NSWCCA 147; 202 A Crim R 209 at [94] - [101].  The most usual case in which that process can occur is when the propositions explicitly ""put"" by counsel for a party are markedly inconsistent with things previously said or evidence subsequently given by that party.  That had no application in this trial, because, as I have said, the evidence was that the applicant exercised his right to silence before trial and he did not give evidence at the trial.  Nevertheless, I consider that there is some force in the proposition that the way things were explained in this particular summing up could have confused the jury.
134Thirdly, generally speaking, neither a Crown Prosecutor nor a trial judge should ask the jury to consider rhetorical questions that invite answers which are adverse to the accused, in light of the danger of the jury coming to believe that the accused in a criminal trial is required to make answer to the prosecution case: Wood v R [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [605]-[606].
135Fourthly, the question left for the consideration of the jury was, in effect, as follows.  If it be the case, as the defence case asserts, that the victim had engaged in consenting sexual contact with the accused on many previous occasions, why would she complain of sexual assault with regard to the final two occasions, if they were, as the defence case asserts, consenting as well?  That question may be simplified and paraphrased as ""Why would the victim make a false complaint in this case if the defence case is to be accepted?""  And that question, to my mind, when shorn of its circularity, is not conceptually different from ""Why would she lie?""
136In other words, I respectfully consider that the implicit question that his Honour asked the jury to consider when purporting to summarise the arguments about complaint of the Crown Prosecutor, whilst not directly contrary to what was said in Palmer v The Queen, had the potential to lead to a line of reasoning that reverses the onus of proof in a way that is prohibited.  The reticence of the Crown Prosecutor was well founded.
137In short, this ground supports an extension of time being granted.
Ground 4 (a)  Evidence was admitted in relation to flight which ought not to have been, or if admitted should have been accompanied by adequate direction from the Learned Trial Judge.(b)  His Honour erred in his directions as to flight(i)  in not differentiating between flight from the applicant's flat and flight from the police.(ii)  in not giving an adequate ""Edwards"" direction.(iii)  misapplying the suggestions of counsel in relation to flight.
138This ground was founded on the proposition that all of the evidence of flight should not have been admitted; in the alternative, that the directions given about it were inadequate.
139Although the position is not entirely clear from the transcript of the legal discussions at trial, I am prepared to approach the matter on the basis that defence counsel objected to all of the evidence said to support a consciousness of guilt on the part of the applicant.  
140With regard to the directions about the topic however, although at the end of the summing up he invited the attention of his Honour to a number of matters, defence counsel did not seek any redirections about it. 
141In submissions in this Court, counsel for the applicant embarked upon a detailed analysis of all the evidence said to constitute flight showing consciousness of guilt.  As I understand his submissions, he did not object to the admission of the evidence that the applicant abandoned his home and possessions on the same day as the sexual contact that underpinned counts two and three.  But he submitted that a great deal of the other evidence said to show a consciousness of guilt by way of flight was irrelevant; or, in the alternative, should have been excluded pursuant to the ""discretion"" contained in s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  He further submitted that the directions given about the evidence of flight were inadequate.
142In this Court the Crown Prosecutor again focused on the absence of complaint by defence counsel about the directions.  She submitted that they were in general conformity with what was said in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [50]-[52] about the requirements for directions with regard to acts other than lies said to show consciousness of guilt.  She also submitted that knowledge on the part of the applicant that the police were looking for him could validly inform an assessment of the other evidence said to demonstrate consciousness of guilt.
143By way of background, in her final address at trial the Crown Prosecutor relied upon a number of aspects of the evidence in support of the submission that the applicant had shown a consciousness of guilt.  I shall discuss them in general chronological order.
144First, one could infer that on 5 July 2005 the applicant sought to wash the bedding from the bed on which the sexual contact took place, along with the shirt that he was wearing at the time. 
145Secondly, on 5 July 2005 the applicant left his room without warning and never returned.  He left a number of personal possessions there, including a desktop computer. 
146Thirdly, after that date the applicant did not complete his university course. 
147Fourthly, over the next several weeks the applicant repeatedly contacted the victim by telephone and email.  The Crown Prosecutor submitted that that could have been in an effort to have her forgive him, as she had seemingly done in some sense after the incident underpinning count one. 
148Fifthly, up until the date of his arrest, the applicant was moving around New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and arguably sleeping in his car in order to facilitate that. 
149Sixthly, in the conversation with his lessor, when told that the police were looking for him, the applicant did not ask why.  Nor did he contact the police after that conversation.
150Seventhly, in the same conversation, when the applicant said that he was ""working up the bush"", that could well have been a lie, in that he was in truth on the South Coast of New South Wales. 
151Eighthly, despite the police having left a message informing the applicant that he was ""wanted"" and asking him to hand himself in to Ulladulla Police Station, he neither returned the call nor attended the Police Station. 
152No discussion took place before the final address of the Crown Prosecutor to determine whether she was entitled to address the jury in those ways.
153The directions that his Honour gave about the topic were as follows:
Now the crown has suggested to you that by reason of the accused absenting himself from his unit on the 5 July, after [the victim's] friends came and took her away and she went to the police station, the fact that the accused absents himself from that unit and then is not seen for several months, the crown invites you to draw an inference as to a consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused by him so doing.  The Crown's case in relation to that is, the suggestion and I say the suggestion only being that here was a relationship which had existed for months andmonths and months, indeed as I understand the suggestionwas going back into 2004 and going right through up untilJuly 2005 it was relationship which involved consensualsex. Indeed on the very first night as I understand it,that [the victim] and her friend ... went to the apartmentof the accused where he cooked them a meal, that there wasconsensual sex on that very first night, that there wasconsensual sex in shopping car parks, in the car park of Fox Studios, in the car park at the Bondi Beach and certainly other locations and involved anal sex and that on this occasion at the Bundanoon Hotel again consensual and on this day 5 July in his home, again consensual.
The crown says therefore, if that was so why would not the accused have remained in his unit, what was the reason for him in effect taking flight from that unit.  The crown's case is the only rational inference that you could draw from those circumstances is an inference of guilt on the part of the accused, that that demonstrates a consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused.  Now that is a matter for you members of the jury whether you accept that that is the only rational inference to be drawn in those circumstances.  I have to say to you though, that in considering that scenario, people do not always act rationally.  It may be that conduct of this sort can possibly be explained in other ways; there maybe reasons for him leaving that unit and not returning, other than a realisation of guilt on his part. Some people may do things out of panic in order to perhaps escape some unjust accusation.  But nevertheless members of the jury, that is a classical matter where it is for you to determine what weight you will give to all of that evidence, it is a matter for you as to whether or not you draw the inference that the crown seeks. 
154Later, at the request of the Crown Prosecutor, his Honour supplemented those directions as follows:
""You remember members of the jury when I indicated to you that the prosecution was asking you to draw the inference as to a consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused on the basis of the circumstances that on that day, 5 July, he left the unit and did not return.  Well of course the evidence of [the lessor] is also something that the crown would ask you to consider on that issue"" 
155When considering the admissibility of evidence said to demonstrate consciousness of guilt (whether it be lies, flight, suborning a witness, or anything else), it is important to recall what was said in R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157 at [60] by Simpson J (with whom Howie AJ agreed).  In short, the task for a trial judge is to determine whether the evidence has the capability to pass the tests enunciated in Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193 and R v Lane, and not to determine whether it actually does so.  The latter question is within the province of the jury.
156To my mind, the evidence that, on 5 July 2005, very soon after the sexual contact, the applicant suddenly left his home and belongings, never to return, certainly has that capability.
157I take the same view of the evidence that, before his departure, the applicant took steps to wash the bedding upon which the sexual contact took place, and the shirt that he had been wearing that morning.
158I also consider that, although less powerful, the evidence that the applicant commenced to move around the state, left university, repeatedly contacted the victim, and possibly lied about his whereabouts, could also have had that capability.  (It is difficult to be determinative about the question, in light of the absence of full argument about it.)
159Nor do I consider that it can be determined that s 137 of the Evidence Act mandated exclusion of all or any of that evidence.
160However, there is a serious question whether the evidence of the applicant declining to return the calls of the police officer and to present himself to the police station shares the requisite capability.  If a person has a right to silence when invited to be interviewed by the police from which no inference can be drawn (except in very limited circumstances delineated by statute), it would be anomalous if a failure to assist the enquiries of the police by returning their calls or attending at a police station could be used adversely to an accused as evidence of consciousness of guilt.
161In Kuehne v R; Humphries M v R; Humphries A v R [2012] NSWCCA 270, the Crown case was that the three appellants were the aggressors in a brawl at a private house and had discharged a weapon there.  The defence case was that the men had not possessed a firearm and were the victims of the violence.  Each of the appellants had delayed for five days in providing their version of events to the police by way of recorded interviews, even though they had been, on their case, the victims of serious offences.
162Contrary to the submissions of defence counsel at trial, the learned trial judge had given the jury a ""consciousness of guilt direction"" with regard to that delay.
163On appeal to this Court, Fullerton J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed on this point) held that the direction should not have been given and that the convictions should be quashed.  Fullerton J noted at [48] that at first instance:
Defence counsel submitted that the consciousness of guilt direction sought by the Crown, based as it was upon the five day delay in the appellant giving his account to police, contravened the prohibition on a jury drawing an adverse inference from the exercise of the right of each of them during that period not to speak to police, whether to volunteer their accounts as innocent victims or to answer questions as suspects. 
At [69] her Honour said:
The Crown [at first instance] did not identify with any clarity how the delay in presenting to police supported an inference of guilt (of each of the appellants of the offences charged) save as to submit that it was capable of revealing they had each concealed their guilt. The trial judge's directions were to the same effect. The circularity in that reasoning deprived the evidence of the essential requirement that the conduct under consideration, together with other circumstances and events, is capable of rationally supporting an inference of guilt. If the issue of delay in this case had that capacity it would follow that in every case where an accused, knowing or believing that they are suspected of having committed an offence, did not promptly give an exculpatory account to police, the Crown would be entitled to seek a consciousness of guilt direction. The absurdity of that proposition exposes the flaw in the Crown's argument at trial and the Crown's submissions on appeal.
164Although the circumstances in that appeal and this application are not identical, I consider that the line of reasoning in the latter part of that paragraph is apposite.  It is one thing to infer that evidence of flight from the scene of an alleged crime, or of other actions calculated to evade the police, is capable of demonstrating a consciousness of guilt.  It is quite another to say that declining to return telephone calls from police officers, or to attend at locations in accordance with their requests or demands, is capable of doing so.
165I consider that the question of the admissibility of some of the evidence said to show a consciousness of guilt supports the application being granted.
166Turning to the question of the adequacy of the directions, it can be seen that they do not delineate explicitly the matters that the jury would need to find established before they could use a lie (or other act) said to have been done in consciousness of guilt, in accordance with the pre-conditions for such use set out in Edwards v the Queen and R v Lane.  To that extent, I respectfully consider that they are deficient.
167On the other hand, I consider that Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules has an important role to play in this context.  As I have said, defence counsel did not seek any re-directions.  It could well be that that was because defence counsel regarded some of the evidence as very adverse, and took the tactical position that the less detailed discussion in the summing up about it the better.  In other words, the tactical view was certainly open that the more the trial judge said about the pre-conditions of use by the jury of the evidence as showing a consciousness of guilt, the more the jury would be inclined to find those pre-conditions fulfilled, and thereafter make use of the evidence against the applicant.
168In those circumstances, I consider that the part of the ground focused upon the inadequacy of the directions about consciousness of guilt does not support leave being granted.
Ground 5 - The trial miscarried because the applicant was not given the benefit of raising his good character in a particular respect, that is that he had no convictions for assault or sexual or indecent assault.
169This ground is founded upon the fact that, although at the time of the trial the applicant had no criminal convictions, his counsel did not place evidence of that fact before the jury by way of raising his character in a particular respect, pursuant to s 110 of the Evidence Act.
170Three affidavits relevant to this ground were read before this Court.
171An affidavit of 4 April 2013 of defence counsel deposed that, although he had read material provided to him by the Crown and by his instructing solicitor at the trial, he was ""still unable to recall any matter which arose in relation to instructions given to me by Mr Miles in relation to the conduct of his case"".  As for matters in the trial transcript, counsel deposed that he had ""no independent recollection of them"".
172The clerk who instructed counsel throughout most of the trial deposed on 8 April 2013 that she had been unable to locate the detailed notes that she took during the trial.  She also deposed that she recalled a conversation with counsel in which he said words to the effect ""our client is a person of good character.  He has no convictions"".
173In an affidavit of 21 March 2013, the solicitor for the applicant at trial deposed that he had been told by his clerk of the conversation between her and counsel about the applicant being of good character.  The affidavit does not state when that conversation was reported to the solicitor.  The affidavit also describes defence counsel as ""a barrister of massive criminal experience having practised in that area nearly all of his life, fairly close to exclusively"". 
174It was established during the hearing of the application that, at the time of the trial, there was evidence that the applicant had used false names on occasions.  No doubt the risk of that evidence being placed before the jury in rebuttal of the proposition that the applicant was a person of good character generally informed the approach of counsel for the applicant in this Court.  His complaint was not that good character had not been raised generally; rather, it was that good character had not been raised in a particular respect.
175It is true that, in any trial, the raising of good character in a general sense powerfully assists the accused, and it may be that in a trial in which sexual offences are alleged it does so with particular force.  Raising character in a particular respect is less powerful, and, by its very specificity, has the potential to lead the jury to speculate about why the evidence is circumscribed.
176In this case, years after the event, it is not possible to reconstruct all of the considerations that may have led counsel not to raise character in a particular respect.  It is possible (though, in light of the undisputed affidavit evidence of the vast experience of defence counsel, very unlikely) that defence counsel simply overlooked the matter.  On the other hand, although I accept that there was no evidence of it presented at the hearing of the application almost six years later, it is possible that the Crown Prosecutor at trial informally told defence counsel of some material that would be relied upon in rebuttal of any evidence of good character in a particular respect, pursuant to s 110(3) of the Evidence Act.  That kind of exchange does not occur infrequently in criminal trials in my experience, and very often defence counsel decides that character should not be raised either generally or specifically, without seeking a ruling from the trial judge.
177On the state of the evidence before this Court, one is unable to reconstruct events sufficiently to determine that the failure of defence counsel to raise the character of the applicant could constitute a substantial injustice.
178I do not consider that ground five supports an extension of time being granted.
The proviso and related concepts
179I have indicated that I consider that grounds one, two, and five do not support an extension of time being granted.  I have also indicated that I consider that ground three and part of ground four support such an extension being granted.
180The further and final aspect of the matter that needs to be considered with regard to this preliminary question is the effect that the proviso contained in s 6 of the Act would have upon the ultimate disposition of the matter if the application were granted.  That calls for a consideration as to whether or not, if an extension of time were granted, there is some prospect of the applicant not only demonstrating that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, but also resisting the proposition of the Crown that, in this case, ""no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"".  To express the inquiry in the terms of Abdul v R, I consider that reflection on the proviso must influence whether to refuse leave to appeal out of time could lead to a substantial injustice.
181To return to the state of the evidence, the jury acquitted the applicant on count one.  That verdict was not surprising, in light of the delay in complaint of many months, the contact with the applicant that the victim engaged in subsequent to the alleged sexual assault, and the absence of supporting evidence.
182The evidence in support of counts two and three, however, was very powerful.
183As I have said, there was no dispute that sexual intercourse occurred between the applicant and the victim; the question with regard to each count was merely whether she was consenting.  In summary, the victim telephoned a friend to pick her up from the bathroom immediately after the sexual contact ended.  She complained of having been sexually assaulted once she arrived at her home.  Later that day her body was seen to have a multitude of separate injuries to it.  There may have been deficiencies with regard to the admission of and directions about the evidence of flight.  Still and all, I consider that it was certainly admissible and highly probative that, on the day of the sexual encounter, the applicant suddenly and permanently left his home and belongings, having sought to wash the bedding and his shirt.  Most importantly of all, two independent witnesses heard sounds from the bedroom in which the sexual contact was taking place.  One of them heard sounds that were powerfully probative of the infliction of force to her body.  Both of them heard words said by the victim that were powerfully probative of a lack of consent on her part.  
184The state of the evidence as a whole leads me to be affirmatively satisfied that, whatever the merits of grounds three and four, the convictions with regard to counts two and three occasioned no substantial miscarriage of justice.  In other words, even were counsel for the applicant to establish the errors that he contended underpinned ground three and four, I respectfully consider that, by way of the application of the proviso, an appeal against conviction would be doomed to failure.  In those circumstances, it would be otiose to grant an extension of time.
185To express my view another way, I do not consider that it has been established that there would be a substantial injustice were the application for extension of time refused.
Conclusion
186Returning in summary to the factors to be considered with regard to an application for an extension of time, the delay between the entry of the convictions and the hearing of the application was many years.  Although an explanation for that delay was provided, it cannot be denied that much of it was the responsibility of the applicant.  There is a clear public interest in favour of the bringing of allegations of serious criminality such as that encompassed in counts two and three to finality, and against reopening the matter after the intervention of almost six years.
187Quite apart from those considerations, an analysis of the evidence as a whole leads me to the view that, even were a ground or grounds established, the convictions would not be quashed, and the maintenance of the convictions does not occasion a substantial injustice.
188In all of those circumstances, I consider that an extension of time should not be granted.
Orders
189I propose the following order:
(1)Leave to appeal out of time refused.

		09 May 2014",2014-05-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763887,RH v R [2014] NSWCCA 71,"Judgment

1WARD JA: This is an appeal against the appellant's conviction for a number of child sexual assault offences. The offences were committed against two children that he and his wife had first fostered and then adopted. To preserve the anonymity of the complainants, I have referred to each of them (and to others by reference to whom their identity might be revealed) by use of pseudonyms. 

2Six of the seven counts on the indictment related to conduct over the period from September 1989 to 1993 against one foster daughter (Jane), when she was aged between 9 and 12 years.

3The seventh count related to conduct in 2003 against another foster daughter (Kay), when she was 12-13 years' old. That count was added by way of amendment to the indictment as a consequence of evidence that Kay gave during a voir dire hearing before Finnane DCJ in advance of the trial.

4The appellant was tried by a jury of twelve in a hearing before Lakatos DCJ. The appellant was found guilty on all but one of the counts relating to the conduct against Jane: three counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years, contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (counts 1-3); one count of sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 16 years, contrary to s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act (count 4); and one count of aggravated indecent assault on a child under 16 years, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act (count 5).

5The jury did not reach a verdict, and was discharged, on count 6. That was a further count of aggravated indecent assault on a child under 16 years but one which, unlike the others, was not alleged to have taken place during the night in Jane's bedroom; rather, it was alleged to have taken place while swimming at a beach.

6The appellant was found guilty on the sole count relating to conduct against Kay, in 2003, a count of aggravated indecent assault on a child under 16 years contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act (count 7). That conduct, again, took place in the child's bedroom but occurred in the morning. Kay also gave evidence at the trial of two earlier uncharged incidents of similar abuse, on which the Crown relied as context and tendency evidence.

7Relevant to some of the grounds on which the appellant now appeals against his convictions is the fact that he had pleaded guilty in 2010 to five counts of aggravated indecent assault involving a third foster daughter (Lisa). Those offences were committed between December 2005 and November 2006, when Lisa was 11 years' old. Evidence of the conduct that was the subject of those convictions was before the jury by way of an agreed statement of facts. Further, each of the appellant, his wife, Lisa and Kay gave evidence relating to the offences against Lisa and/or as to the circumstances surrounding Lisa's disclosure of the conduct to which the appellant had pleaded guilty.

8The appellant was sentenced by Lakatos DCJ to an aggregate sentence comprised of a non-parole period of 5 years with a further period of imprisonment for two years from the expiry of the non-parole period. He is eligible to be considered for parole at the expiration of the non-parole period on 17 July 2017. There is no appeal from the sentence imposed by Lakatos DCJ. There was no suggestion in the reasons on sentence by the trial judge of any disquiet in respect of the convictions.

Background

Foster placements/occasions of alleged abuse

9The appellant and his wife have 3 natural daughters, two of whom (to whom reference will be made in the course of these reasons) are Mary and Nora. The appellant and his wife had been involved, over a considerable period of time, in organisations that facilitated the placement of children in foster care and had provided foster care for many children; ""dozens upon dozens"" according to the appellant, at least 40, according to the appellant's wife. Most of those foster children had been fostered on temporary placements. The appellant's wife had, at least for some of the time, a business that involved the provision of childcare.

10There was no dispute at trial as to the respective ages of each Jane, Kay and Lisa when they were placed in foster care with the appellant and his wife (nor, in the case of Jane and Kay, as to their age when they were adopted by the couple), those being agreed facts at the trial. It was also not disputed that all three of the children in question had been removed from troubled or disturbed households, though this was not part of the agreed facts. In the case of Jane, the Crown raised no objection to Counsel for the appellant referring to the fact that she had been removed from her biological mother's care because she had been subjected to abuse and neglect. Both the appellant and his wife referred in their evidence to Jane having been affected by her background when she arrived in their home (variously describing her as ""tender"", ""agitated"", ""jumpy"" and an ""extremely damaged and extremely distressed"" child.

Jane

11Jane was placed in foster care with the appellant and his wife in June 1989, when she was almost 8¾ years' old. Prior to that, Jane had been in temporary foster care for approximately 18 months with another carer. She had been removed from the care of her biological mother when she was 7 years' old.

12At the time Jane was placed in the care of the appellant and his wife, their three biological daughters were still living at their home and the appellant and his wife had already fostered, and adopted another daughter (the appellant referring to his three biological daughters and the first adopted foster daughter as ""more or less [his] first family"").

13Jane was adopted by the appellant and his wife when she was 12 years' old. The appellant's evidence was that Jane had been ""desperate"" to be adopted ""by hook or by crook"".

14The offences found to have taken place against Jane occurred both before and after her adoption. Jane's evidence was that after she came to live with the appellant and his wife the appellant engaged in ""tickle fights"" with her (conduct that the Crown characterised as ""grooming behaviour""), which involved the appellant tickling various parts of her body but, she said, mainly touching her breasts and genital area. Jane's evidence was inconsistent as to when the tickle fights had commenced and for how long they had continued before the first occasion on which the conduct with which the appellant was charged, and found guilty, occurred.

15Jane said that when she was ""about"" 9 years' old, the appellant started coming into her bedroom at night (identified as bedroom 2), touching her breasts, genital area and face; rubbing her vagina; and digitally penetrating her vagina. Jane's evidence was that the appellant's conduct ""eased off"" once she commenced menstruation at around 12 or 13 and that it had stopped altogether by the time she was 14 years' old. Jane left the appellant's home when she was about 16-17 years' old (i.e., around 1996/1997). The appellant described that as a ""traumatic"" time, being the first time that one of the family had left in unhappy circumstances.

Kay

16Kay and her brother were placed in foster care with the appellant and his wife in July 1994. Kay was just under 4 years' old. At that time, Jane was nearly 14 years' old and the only child still living in the appellant and his wife's home. Kay and her brother were adopted by the appellant and his wife in 1997, after Jane had left the home and around the time that Lisa and her sister were placed with them.

17Kay gave evidence of sexual abuse by the appellant occurring in 2003 (after Jane had left home). She had a specific recollection of three particular incidents, when she was around 12-13, when she said the appellant put his hand into her underwear and rubbed her vagina on the outside, although she said that the abuse had occurred on many times. Kay did not recall the appellant ever having touched her breasts. Only the third incident was the subject of a criminal charge (count 7).

18The first specific incident which Kay recalled was placed by her as occurring when the appellant's wife was in hospital. Kay said that on that occasion, she had asked the appellant if she could sleep in his and his wife's bed and that when she was in their bed, the appellant had put his hand in her underwear and rubbed outside her vagina. Kay said that on that occasion the appellant had said to her ""Do you like that?"" (on the voir dire she had put this as ""Do you not like that?"" and ""Do you not like this?""). Kay did not think that this was the first time that the appellant had touched her inappropriately, because she could remember feeling that it was a familiar thing to happen, but it was nevertheless the first incident that she was able specifically to recall. (From documents subpoenaed from two hospitals at which the appellant's wife had received treatment, the first such hospitalisation was in 2000. If so, this would place the first incident recalled by Kay as occurring in 2000. If so, she would have been around 10 years' old at that time.)

19Kay placed the second incident as occurring shortly after the first, this time when she was in her own bed (identified by her, at the trial, as bedroom 2 but about which she was uncertain at the voir dire hearing - on that occasion she was not sure whether it was a different bedroom from that of the count 7 incident, but was sure that it was a different bed). At trial she also confirmed that it was a different bed. Kay said that the appellant had come home from a Lions Club meeting. Kay said that she had asked the appellant to tickle her back and that he did so but that he then put his hand down her pants and reached underneath and rubbed her vagina. The timing of this incident is of some significance, since the evidence of the appellant and his wife was that in 1997, when Lisa joined the household, Lisa occupied bedroom 2.

20As noted, those two incidents were not the subject of any charges against the appellant but were relied on by the Crown at the trial as context and tendency evidence.

21The third incident (which was the subject of count 7) was one that Kay recalled occurred in a different bedroom (identified as bedroom 5) and took place in the morning. Kay said that she was in bed and that the appellant came in, put his hand down her pants and rubbed her vagina; that she said to him, in what she described as ""a joking manner"" that she would scream; that she then said that she needed to go to the bathroom; took a mobile phone, went to the bathroom and called the appellant's wife, who she said was at work. Kay said that she then ran to a caravan at the side of the house and locked herself in; that she was very upset and was crying; that the appellant tried to open the caravan door; and that the appellant had said to her ""Come out. We can talk about it"" and had asked her if she had rung her mother. Kay said that this was the last time that the appellant had touched her (by which, in the context, I infer meant that this was the last time he had touched her inappropriately).

22Kay's evidence was that she disclosed the appellant's conduct to the appellant's wife that same day, when the appellant's wife returned from work. (I refer to the circumstances and content of this disclosure in more detail later in these reasons.) Kay remained in the appellant's and his wife's home until early 2009 when she left to undergo vocational training.

Lisa

23Lisa and her sister were placed in foster care with the appellant and his wife in 1997. Lisa was around 2-3 years' old at the time; Kay was around 7 years' old.

24Lisa's evidence was that between 2005 and 2006, i.e., when she was between 11-12 years' old (and, according to her police interview, just after she ""hit puberty"", the appellant came into her bedroom, touched her breast and twice put his mouth on her breast. That conduct was the subject of the charges to which the appellant pleaded guilty. In her police interview, Lisa said that the appellant ""did it so many times"", did it ""anywhere, bedroom, loungeroom"" and that he had touched her breasts and sometimes her vagina, though I note that touching her vagina was not part of the conduct to which the appellant pleaded guilty. Lisa also said that sometimes the appellant had pretended he was tickling her.

25On the occasion the subject of the last such count, the appellant's wife walked into Lisa's bedroom and witnessed the appellant touching Lisa's breast. At the trial, the appellant's wife was adamant, notwithstanding the appellant's guilty plea, that the event she had witnessed, though inappropriate, was a ""spontaneous act"" and was not of a sexual nature. The appellant's wife was steadfast in her belief that the appellant had not committed the offences to which he had pleaded guilty.
26From the above brief chronology it is apparent that: the admitted offences against Lisa occurred while Kay was still living in the appellant's home, some 2 or 3 years after the conduct involving Kay; and that the conduct of which Jane complained occurred some 14 years before the conduct involving Kay and some 16 years before the offences admitted to have taken place against Lisa. Much significance is placed by the appellant in the present proceedings on the temporal gaps between the respective incidents: from 1989-1993 (in the case of Jane); to 2003 (in the case of Kay); and then in 2005-2006 (in the case of Lisa).

Disclosure by respective complainants of appellant's conduct

Jane

27Jane's evidence was that, after she was adopted (i.e., around 12 years' old), she told the appellant's wife that the appellant was touching her and doing things to her. The appellant's wife adamantly denied this. Jane said (and this was also denied by the appellant's wife) that when she made the disclosure that the appellant had been coming into her bedroom and touching her at night and what she said was happening at the beach, the appellant's wife physically attacked her; called her a liar, a tramp and a whore; and told her that she was throwing herself at him. Jane said that the appellant's wife told her that no-one would believe her if she told anyone; and told her that if it was not for them she would not have a family. Jane did not tell anyone else about the appellant's conduct at the time.

28In about 2000 or 2001, according to Jane, though placed at around late 2002/2003 by Mary's husband, Paul (by which time Jane had been living away from the appellant's home for a few years), Jane disclosed to Paul that she had been sexually abused by the appellant. She says that she did not give Paul any detail of the abuse. Paul gave evidence in substance corroborating Jane's evidence as to this disclosure, though as noted he said it was in 2003 or late 2002/2003. Paul said that Jane had told him that the appellant had touched her inappropriately but had not given him any details. No disclosure was made by Jane to Mary at this time, though Paul thought that he would have said something to Mary about Jane's disclosure.

Kay

29The next evidence of any complaint about the appellant's conduct occurred in 2003 at the time of the incident the subject of count 7. It is not disputed that Kay rang the appellant's wife at this time. Kay also locked herself in the caravan next to the house (I will refer to this incident of abuse as the caravan incident although there is no suggestion that it took place in the caravan.) There is no dispute that when the appellant's wife came home there was a disclosure of some kind made to the appellant's wife on this occasion, as to the appellant touching Kay. However, the versions given by Kay, on the one hand, and by the appellant and his wife differed markedly.

30At the voir dire hearing, when asked what she had told the appellant's wife on that occasion, Kay said ""I don't remember. Just that Dad had touched me. Nothing other than that"". At the trial, Kay said that she had told the appellant's wife that ""dad had stuck his hand down my pants and had touched me""; that he had touched her vagina and that it was not the first time.

31Kay also said that, after that incident, there was a conversation with the appellant's wife as to whether Kay wanted the appellant to move out or if Kay wanted to move out and live with her older sister (Mary) and that the appellant's wife said that they could not tell anyone because the other foster children (by this stage, Kay's brother, Lisa and Lisa's sister) were too old to get new homes. The appellant's wife denied this. Kay also said that the appellant's wife promised her that it would never happen again to anyone and said ""I'll make sure that it doesn't happen again ever"".

32The version given by the appellant's wife, consistent with the version she gave to a psychiatrist later that year and with the version given by the appellant, was that Kay had said to her words to the effect that the appellant had taken a kitten out from underneath her shirt and had touched her breasts; that she was angry; and that she had questioned whether he had a right to do that. (That version of events was not wholly consistent with the version given later to the Department of Community Services (DOCS) caseworker to whom the incident was reported.)

33At trial, Kay denied that when this incident occurred she had had a cat or kitten down the front of her shirt; said that she did not think that she had had a cat or kitten in the room when the appellant came in; said that she did not like animals in her bed; said that she did not ever remember the appellant touching her breasts; and denied that she had told the appellant's wife that the appellant had touched her breasts as he was taking the cat away from her that she had down the front of her nightie.

34Later in 2003, the appellant and his wife took Kay to see a psychiatrist, Dr Rewais. The referral to Dr Rewais was provided by the appellant's doctor, Dr Smith. There was some doubt in the evidence as to how that referral had been procured. The appellant's wife, when giving evidence at the trial, was questioned by the Crown as to the circumstances in which that referral was made; in particular as to the answers given by the appellant's wife to the Court at a pre-trial hearing on 29 February 2012. The appellant's wife accepted, at trial, that at the pre-trial hearing she had said she was unable to recall the name of the ""counsellor"" and that she thought it was someone at Cronulla. It was not disputed that at all relevant times Dr Rewais' practice was based at Miranda.

35The appellant's wife denied that she had made the arrangements for Kay to see Dr Rewais, said that she was not aware who had; and said that she did not remember what she had told Kay and did not know at the time that her husband had been seeing Dr Smith in July and August 2003 (though she knew he was being treated by a doctor at that time. The appellant's wife also accepted that at the pre-trial hearing her evidence as to how she came to find the counsellor had been that she did not actually recall but that it could have been somebody whose name or information had been given during a DOCS meeting.

36According to Dr Rewais' notes, there were three consultations with him. The appellant's wife gave evidence, inconsistent (in this respect and others) with the psychiatrist's contemporaneous notes, that she had only attended in consultation with Kay once and that she had not spoken with Dr Rewais again until after he had concluded his discussions with Kay (though she said that Kay had attended Dr Rewais' office on a couple of other occasions).

37At the voir dire hearing, Kay said that when she saw the ""counsellor"" (Dr Rewais) she had ""said not exactly what he had done to me, more like a watered down version, I guess to protect him"" and that she had said ""that he just touched my breasts, which weren't really breasts then"". At trial, she admitted that she had given what she called a ""watered down"" version of the incident to the psychiatrist; said that what she had told Dr Rewais was a lie; and said that she had told him because that was what her mother had told her to do. Kay explained what she had meant by ""watered down"" was that she thought touching someone's breasts was less bad than touching someone's vagina.

38Dr Rewais' notes recorded that the appellant was present at that first consultation and that both the appellant and his wife became very upset and angry when he informed them that he would be obliged to make a formal notification of the incident to DOCS.

39Dr Rewais said that the appellant's wife had told him that she was ""shattered""; that she felt betrayed; that she would not have sought help if she had known that this was going to happen; that it would rip the family apart; and that she had raised concerns as to her business (as a licensed childcare worker). Dr Rewais' notes recorded that Kay was very, very upset, scared and distressed and that she did not want to get the appellant and his wife into trouble; and that ""Kay seemed to be under a great deal of pressure to minimise the significance of the alleged abuse"". His recollection was that the appellant and his wife were pushing not to have the notification made and not to make ""too much of an issue of that"". He said in his evidence in court that Kay was already quite distressed before he had mentioned the notification to DOCS.

40Dr Rewais' impression at the time, from Kay's level of distress and how she was presenting, was that Kay did not feel that the incident was ""an incidental situation"". He was of the opinion that ""something"" had happened and he said that he had enough concern to make the notification to DOCS.

41Dr Rewais said that there was a suggestion at the time (he thought it would have been by the appellant's wife, as she had been doing most of the talking in the sessions) that the family would contact DOCS first and would then provide him with the contact details of someone at DOCS for the purposes of the notification; and that they did so. He later spoke with a DOCS caseworker (Ms McKenzie). He also wrote to the general practitioner who had referred Kay to him (Dr Smith) recording, inter alia, that the appellant had appeared ""remorseful"" at first but in subsequent appointments had become very angry. (The appellant denied having attended during the consultation for any of the subsequent appointments).

42At trial, the appellant's wife said that she did not recall telling Dr Rewais anything (his notes said that she said she was shattered); could not recall the conversation at all; did not recall that Dr Rewais had informed her and her husband that he would have to notify DOCS; denied that Dr Rewais had told them on the first visit that he would have to notify DOCS. Then, quite remarkably given the content of Dr Rewais' contemporaneous notes and the likely reaction that any such advice would be expected to cause, the appellant's wife said that at the final conversation Dr Rewais had said ""I don't think that there is any particular problem here but I think that maybe we should speak with DOCS"" and that perhaps she and Kay would like to go and speak to DOCS before he did. The version given by the appellant's wife is inconsistent with Dr Rewais' evidence that he considered that the disclosure gave rise to an obligation on his part to make the relevant notification.

43Significantly, when considering the credibility of the appellant's wife, she said at trial (inconsistently with Dr Rewais' contemporaneous notes) that she did not recall becoming quite angry in the consultation with Dr Rewais; did not recall raising her voice to him; did not recall that she had told him that she felt betrayed or that she would not have sought help if she had known that he was going to notify DOCS; did not tell him that it would rip the family apart; and did not express concerns about the ramifications for her business or about the other children in foster care with her at that time. She professed a complete lack of recollection about the conversation with Dr Rewais. She did not recall any meeting with Dr Rewais where her husband was present; did not recall being ""very upset"" though she did not deny that she ""was upset at the suggestion that we should introduce DOCS into any procedure"" and said that the reason for this was that ""I just felt it didn't warrant what was suggested"".

44The appellant's wife agreed at trial that she had contacted DOCS around that time and had made an appointment with somebody that she knew at DOCS. She said she could not recall who had suggested anything but added that her memory was that Dr Rewais had suggested that perhaps she should take Kay and have a talk with them.

45The DOCS caseworker to whom the appellant's wife spoke (Ms McKenzie) was at one stage a DOCS caseworker for Lisa (and someone with whom the appellant's wife said she had had previous dealings with other children who had been placed with her). The appellant's wife accepted that at the pre-trial hearing she had said that she and Kay had seen Dr Rewais in the morning and then had seen the DOCS person about lunchtime or early in the afternoon on the same day, but at trial she said that was not her recollection and she did not know when she had seen them.

46Kay's evidence was that the appellant's wife had written out on a piece of paper, in advance of the meeting, what she was to tell DOCS in relation to the incident (namely, ""that Dad had touched my breasts and that he was just checking puberty-wise what was going on with my body and that I wasn't concerned about it at all; but that Dr Rewais had said that he had to report it"" and that this was what she had said to the DOCS caseworker. The appellant's wife denied that she had written anything at all and the appellant denied having seen any such document.

47Ms McKenzie gave evidence of the interview with the appellant, his wife and Kay. Ms McKenzie thought that the appellant's wife had arranged the meeting but was not one hundred percent sure; other than that she knew that she had not arranged it herself. She thought that the appellant's wife had spoken first and said:

She said something like [the appellant] had touched [Kay] on the breast and, like, and got a surprise and said, ""Oh, boobs,"" like it was a surprise that she was developing

...

my memory is that they almost made it sound like it was an accidental thing that happened.

48Ms McKenzie's recollection was that the appellant's wife had dominated the conversation. Ms McKenzie said that she then had a separate short interview with Kay and that Kay had said ""it was a very minimal thing that happened ... she almost made it sound like it was an accidental thing. She was quite embarrassed"". Ms McKenzie said that she asked Kay whether she was upset by it and that Kay said that she was not and that she asked Kay whether she wanted to take it any further and that Kay said she did not. Ms McKenzie spoke immediately with her supervisor and said that he had said that ""from what [Kay] had told me that we really didn't have grounds to take it any further"". Ms McKenzie could not recall any mention of a cat.

49Ms McKenzie was not aware of the fact that Kay had seen a psychiatrist in relation to this incident and was not informed that the appellant and his wife had obtained a referral from his doctor to take her to the psychiatrist in relation to the incident.

50Kay's evidence was that the first time that she communicated to anyone, other than the appellant's wife, what the appellant had done to her was in 2006 (on the same day that the appellant's wife witnessed the incident where the appellant had his hand on Lisa's breast). She said that this was a communication to Lisa that the appellant had ""done the same thing"" to her, but that she did not give Lisa any further details.

51As to what had occurred on that occasion, Kay recalled that one morning before school she had been told, by her brother and by Lisa's sister, that her parents were having a ""massive fight"". She said that the appellant's wife then took her aside and said ""What happened to you happened to [Lisa]"". Kay said that she ""knew what that meant straightaway. She didn't have to explain to me at all"". As it was not suggested that the appellant's wife had told Kay what she had actually witnessed, if this is the correct order of events this can only logically be understood as being that Kay made an assumption that what the appellant's wife was referring to as having happened to Lisa was touching of the kind that Kay alleges had happened to her (inappropriate touching or, to be more precise having regard to her evidence in connection with the trial, rubbing on the outside of her vagina).

52Kay said that she went to Lisa's room and said to her ""The same thing happened to me"" so that Lisa would know that she was not alone. Kay said that what she meant by that was that the appellant had abused her as well. She accepted that at that point she did not know specifically what had happened to Lisa. At some point later that day when she and Lisa were together, probably in a bedroom, Kay said that Lisa told her that the appellant had put his mouth on her breast and had asked if she liked it.

53Kay's evidence was that the appellant's wife told her that the appellant had said he was going to call the police but that she had asked him not to do so. The appellant's wife denied this.

54A few days after this, following an argument about an unrelated matter, Kay, Lisa and Lisa's sister went to Mary's place. Kay said that some of the foster children had decided to run away from home and she went with them. Kay's evidence was that when the appellant came to take them back home, she told Mary, in the presence of Lisa, that the appellant had molested both herself and Lisa. She said that she did not tell Mary the details and that Lisa said nothing. Mary in essence corroborated that evidence. So did Lisa, who said that this was the first time that she had heard the word ""molested"". The appellant said that he recalled an argument and that Kay had shouted something at him but could not recall what.

55Mary then asked two pastors from her church to come to the house but neither Kay nor Lisa made any disclosure to them about the alleged abuse.

56The children remained at Mary's place for a few days. There was a family meeting there, attended by the appellant, his wife, Mary, Paul, Nora, Kay and Lisa. I will refer in due course to the versions of what was said or discussed at this meeting. Relevantly, however, the appellant accepts that the topics for discussion included what was in the best interests of the children and that he had apologised for the matter having come to the stage of a family meeting.

57Among other things, Kay said that in the course of that meeting the appellant's wife said that if the children moved back home a big door would be put over a void in the staircase and locked at night so the appellant could not come up to the children's rooms in the evening. That evidence was consistent with the evidence given by Mary and Paul as to what occurred in the family meeting (i.e., the reference being made to locks being placed on the doors of the children's rooms) and by Lisa's evidence to the police, as well as the evidence of the appellant himself, to which I will refer shortly. The appellant's wife recalled some discussion about locks on doors but dismissed this as something that was not serious (""tongue in cheek"").

58Tellingly, the discussion about putting locks on doors was part of discussion as to a family agreement as to what was to take place if the children were to return to the appellant's and his wife's home. The appellant referred to this as a discussion about ""protocols"", although later correspondence to DOCS referred to these as ""structures"". Further, the appellant recalled that one of the protocols was that he was not to go to the children's rooms and that his wife was to know where he was at all times. Such a protocol is not consistent with the appellant's wife's denial that any offences had been committed and it supports a conclusion that the family members had no trust in the appellant's conduct. It also supports a conclusion that Kay was truthful in her evidence that the incidents with Lisa were not the first occasion when the appellant had engaged in sexual abuse of this kind.

59The only other occasion on which there was reference to any discussion between Lisa and Kay as to the appellant's conduct towards Lisa, prior to the trial, was in evidence given by Kay during the voir dire hearing that, at a country musical festival in Tamworth, she had had a conversation with Lisa about the appellant's conduct. However, Kay said that this was not about what had happened; rather that Lisa had said that she was upset about it.

60Kay left home in about February 2009 for vocational training. She gave evidence that in about June 2009, before a trip she was taking to America, she had a conversation with the appellant in which he said that he was worried about what Lisa might say or do; that he was sorry for what he had done; that he had asked for God's forgiveness and believed he had been forgiven; and then asked for Kay's forgiveness. The appellant denied this conversation. The reference to supplication to God for forgiveness is relevant in light of the evidence that Kay was a person with religious faith. Indeed, she explained the delay in making complaint of the appellant's conduct to her having forgiven him. Further, the existence of concern on the part of the appellant as to disclosure by Lisa (though denied by him) would be consistent with Lisa's evidence that she had on various occasions held the appellant's conduct over him.

Lisa

61Lisa moved out of home after Kay left and was for a time living in a refuge. She gave evidence of an occasion when she was staying at the refuge, and the appellant was driving her back to the refuge, when she said that the appellant told her he loved her; that God had forgiven him and that she had ""better forgive him too"". The appellant denied this.

62Lisa notified DOCS of her complaints in around mid 2009. DOCS referred the matter to the police.

63The appellant was then charged with five counts of aggravated indecent assault against Lisa. In about August 2009, Kay gave police a statement, in connection with the charges involving Lisa, in which she said that she had also been sexually abused by the appellant but that did not want to give details of the abuse. Accordingly, it was accepted by the appellant's Counsel in these proceedings that from August 2009 the fact that Kay had disclosed previous abuse was known. The appellant emphasises, however, that it was not until the voir dire hearing that Kay made known the details of the abuse of which she had earlier complained.

Disclosure by Jane in 2009

64Sometime in about September 2009, after the appellant had been charged in relation to the assaults on Lisa, Mary and Paul told Jane that the appellant had been charged and that he had been hurting Kay and Lisa. Paul gave evidence that what he told Jane was that the appellant was in gaol ""for inappropriately touching [Lisa] and [Kay]"". Mary's evidence was to similar effect. Jane's evidence was that she then reminded Paul of her earlier disclosure to him. Again, this was broadly corroborated by the evidence of Paul and Mary.

65Jane then gave police a statement in January 2010 as to the appellant's conduct towards her, which led to the charges the subject of the proceedings commenced against the appellant in 2011. She gave a second statement to the police in September 2011. At the trial she was cross-examined on those statements.

Plea of guilty regarding conduct towards Lisa

66On 14 December 2010, the appellant admitted his guilt in relation to the five counts involving conduct against Lisa. He was given a 15 month suspended custodial sentence.

67In the present proceedings, the Crown tendered in evidence a Statement of Agreed Facts signed by the appellant, in which the appellant agreed that, in pleading guilty to the offences against Lisa, he had admitted the facts there set out when the matter was dealt with by the Local Court.

68Those admissions included a description of the conduct the subject of the five counts of aggravated indecent assault against Lisa: each of the first two counts included conduct (occurring on the same occasion) in which the appellant placed his mouth over one of Lisa's breasts while she was lying in her bedroom; the third count related to the appellant coming into her bedroom after a Lions Club meeting, lifting her body up and placing his hands under her clothing and onto her breasts; the fourth count was of sliding a hand down Lisa's stomach and onto the top of her vagina (under her pyjama pants and on top of her ""pull ups""); and the fifth count was the occasion when the appellant's wife had walked into the bedroom and witnessed his hand on Lisa's breast.

69As to that last count, the Statement of Agreed Facts stated that the appellant had come into Lisa's room to wake her up; that he had walked over to her bed and placed both his hands under her clothing and onto both her breasts; that his wife had opened the door and looked into the bedroom; that he had quickly removed his hands and left the room; that Lisa had started to cry and said to his wife ""He touched me"" and pointed to her breasts; and that, some time after Lisa had made that disclosure, his wife had arranged a family meeting attended by him, Lisa, Kay, two of their natural daughters (Mary and Nora) and his wife; and that he had said on numerous occasions ""I am sorry for everything"".

Voir dire hearing

70As has been noted earlier, the appellant was initially charged only with the conduct relating to Jane. A pre-trial voir dire hearing was held in February 2012 before Finnane DCJ in the context of an issue that had arisen as to access to documents that had been sought under a Crown subpoena to DOCS, in circumstances where the Crown submitted that if certain of the subpoenaed materials did not fall within the category of protected communications then they might need to be tendered by the Crown as relevant to inculpation or exculpation. Ultimately, no such material was tendered in the trial and nothing turns on this.

71However, at the voir dire hearing, issues were also raised as to the admissibility of evidence the subject of two tendency notices that had been issued by the Crown pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), the first in relation to tendency on the part of the appellant, the second in relation to tendency on the part of his wife.

72As to the appellant, the tendency sought to be proved included his tendency:

2(a) To have a sexual interest in girls aged between 8-13

(b) To sexually and indecently assault young girls who were in his care until they reached puberty

(c) To use his position of authority as a foster father in order to gain access to young girl's [sic] for the purpose of sexually and indecently assaulting them 

73As to the appellant's wife, the tendency sought to be proved by the Crown included a tendency to dissuade, discourage and deter young girls who were in her care, and who complained about sexual abuse by the appellant, from telling other persons about the abuse or reporting it to authorities.

74Evidence was called at the voir dire hearing from each of Jane and Kay, as well as from Lisa, Mary, Paul and the appellant's wife. The trial advocate explained to Finnane DCJ that this was in the context of testing the reasonable possibility of contamination and concoction between the complainants.

75Following the disclosure by Kay, in the course of that evidence, of details (hitherto unforthcoming) of the alleged sexual abuse by the appellant towards her, the Crown obtained leave to serve amended tendency notices and sought leave to present an amended indictment which contained the additional count of aggravated indecent assault on Kay.

76Finnane DCJ gave judgment on the admissibility of the tendency evidence on 2 May 2012. In summary, his Honour did not permit the Crown to call evidence directed to showing tendency as claimed on the part of the appellant's wife. However, his Honour did permit evidence to be adduced from each of Jane, Kay and Lisa as tendency evidence going to the tendency sought to be established on the part of the appellant.

77His Honour (at [27]-[30]) addressed the submission of Counsel for the appellant that there was evidence of concoction. His Honour expressed the opinion that it was now doubtful that the Hoch principle (derived from Hoch v The Queen [1998] HCA 50; (1988) 165 CLR 292) (that propensity evidence should be rejected if there is a reasonable possibility of concoction) still stood, having regard to ss 97, 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act. His Honour considered that it was not necessary to determine that issue, being content to follow the reasoning of Hodgson JA in BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303 (at [106]-[111]).

78His Honour concluded (at [31]) that there was no real chance of contamination of the evidence of the tendency witnesses, noting that most of the complaints were in vague terms and that the mere fact of complaints being made, afforded no basis for concluding that there was a real chance of concoction, as opposed to a merely speculative basis for concoction. Indeed, his Honour went further (at [32]) and expressed the opinion that there was nothing at all in the evidence that raised ""even vaguely"" the possibility of concoction. (In the present proceedings, the appellant contends for the opposite conclusion.)

79His Honour went on to note (at [32]) a submission by Counsel for the appellant that the tendency evidence should not be permitted because it lacked probative value and its prejudicial effect outweighed the probative value. His Honour stated (at [33]) that the correct application of the principles to which he had referred resulted in the admission of the evidence, concluding that it was ""strong evidence of the tendency of the accused to commit sexual offences against girls under the age of 12"" and that ""in no way would it create impermissible prejudice against the accused, when correct explanations [sic] of the evidence is given by the trial judge"" (my emphasis).
80While expressed briefly, there is nothing to suggest that his Honour did not have regard to and address the correct test for the admission of tendency evidence (as is implicit from his stated conclusions at [33]) and no complaint is now made as to the test applied by his Honour.

81Nor, on the present application, is any complaint made as to the content or adequacy of the directions ultimately given by the trial judge (Lakatos DCJ) at the trial as to the context or tendency evidence or as to the trial judge's refusal during the course of the trial to withdraw the tendency evidence from the jury.

82The agreed statement of facts as to how and when the appellant had committed the offences, which the Crown said constituted admissions by the appellant, was admitted by consent at the trial on the basis that Lisa was going to be called in any event.

83The appellant's complaint is as to the admission of the evidence in the first place, which it is contended caused irreparable prejudice to the appellant by making it ""almost impossible"" for the jury to regard him as a credible or reliable witness. In that regard, principal emphasis is placed on the evidence put to the jury of the appellant's plea of guilty to the offences against Lisa and the admission of the facts as to those offences.

Grounds of Appeal

84Of the 9 grounds of appeal originally sought to be raised by the appellant, only 7 are now pressed, those being ground 1 and grounds 3-8.

85In summary, ground 1 and grounds 3-6 relate to the admission by Finnane DCJ, prior to the hearing of the trial before Lakatos DCJ, of the tendency evidence of the complainants (Jane and Kay) and of Lisa; grounds 7 and 8 contend that the respective guilty verdicts were unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
Grounds 1-6: Tendency Evidence

86The basis on which it is contended that Finnane DCJ erred in the admission of the tendency evidence to prove each of the respective counts against the appellant is broadly the same and therefore it is convenient to deal with them together. For completeness, however, I note that the risk of contamination/concoction is particularly pressed in relation to ground 4 and that ground 6 focuses on the probative weight of the two earlier uncharged incidents of which Kay gave evidence. The five grounds of appeal pressed in relation to the tendency evidence are as follows:

Ground 1: The tendency evidence of Lisa was improperly admitted to prove counts one to six on the indictment (relating to the offences against Jane)

Ground 3: The tendency evidence of Kay was improperly admitted to prove counts one to six on the indictment (relating to the offences against Jane)

Ground 4: The tendency evidence of Lisa was improperly admitted to prove count seven on the indictment (relating to the offence against Kay)

Ground 5: The tendency evidence of Jane was improperly admitted to prove count seven on the indictment (relating to the offence against Kay)

Ground 6: The evidence of Kay of the two earlier (uncharged) incidents involving allegations of indecent assaults by the appellant were of insufficient probative value to be relied upon as tendency evidence

87Broadly, the complaint by the appellant as to the admission of the tendency evidence is that his Honour erred in concluding that the probative value of that evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect its admission might have on the appellant. It is submitted that the probative value of the evidence was diminished having regard, first, to the sequence of events (referred to as the temporal nature of the tendency) and, second, to the differences between the acts of which complaint was made. It is further submitted that the prejudicial nature of the evidence (particularly that the appellant had pleaded guilty to the offences against Lisa) was high.

Temporal nature of the tendency evidence

88As noted, the conduct admitted by the appellant against Lisa occurred in 2005 to 2006, whereas the conduct complained of by Kay was in 2003 and the conduct complained of by Jane was over the period between 1989 and 1993.

89The appellant accepts that, where acts are sequential and occur in a confined time period, evidence of tendency can be probative. The complaint made here, however, is that the acts in question did not occur within a confined time and, in particular, that the tendency evidence included acts subsequent to those that had been charged. Hence it is submitted that the probative weight of that evidence was less than if the acts relied on as tendency had been prior to that of the relevant counts.

90The appellant argues that, in the case of subsequent acts, there might be an explanation for conduct to manifest itself at a particular (later) time (such as, in his case, his depression in 2002/2003) such that it could not be reasoned from that particular behaviour, even if it revealed a tendency, that the tendency had been present or had been acted upon at an earlier time.

91Of course, on the count relating to conduct against Kay, part of the tendency evidence relied upon was of earlier conduct (being the conduct towards Jane and the earlier uncharged acts of which Kay gave evidence). Hence, the focus of the complaint as to admission of evidence of subsequent sexual conduct in relation to count 7 focuses largely on the evidence adduced in relation to the admitted conduct against Lisa.

92Principally, the argument put for the appellant was that the process of reasoning in which the jury was invited to engage, by the use of the tendency evidence relating to the admitted conduct in relation to Lisa, was impermissible, requiring it to assume the existence of the claimed tendency at an earlier time, so as then to conclude on the basis of assumed, not proven, facts that the appellant was guilty of the earlier offences as charged.

93The appellant argues that, when the question of admissibility of the tendency evidence was considered by Finnane DCJ, its sequential nature was not looked at. In this regard, the Crown accepts that the focus of the voir dire hearing was the issue of contamination or concoction of the tendency evidence but nevertheless submits that Finnane DCJ must also have had regard to the issue of contemporaneity in coming to the conclusion that the evidence was of strong probative value and that its prejudicial effect would be overcome by appropriate directions as to its use. Certainly, the cross-examination of the respective witnesses would have made clear to his Honour the chronological sequence of the events that were the subject of the tendency evidence. 

94The Crown's case at trial was that the sequential nature of the assaults supported the conclusion that the appellant had a tendency sexually to exploit his relationship with young girls of a particular age range whose family circumstances were such that each was unsupported and vulnerable, and who had been placed in his foster care; that tendency being to use each in a sexual way at a particular stage of the girl's development. Hence it is submitted that the temporal gap did not weaken the probative value of the tendency evidence (referring to R v SK; SK v R [2011] NSWCCA 292). 

95The appellant relies on R v Dann [2000] NSWCCA 185 and R v Thomas Douglas Watkins [2005] NSWCCA 164 as support for the proposition that conduct of the appellant at a later time could not be relied upon to reason that a tendency revealed by that conduct existed much earlier and hence had less probative value than evidence of earlier conduct would have had.

R v Dann

96In Dann, this Court considered a conviction appeal by the appellant, who had been found guilty on two counts of homosexual intercourse with his 7 year old stepson. The stepson gave evidence of three other uncharged incidents occurring later in the same year as the conduct the subject of the indictment. The evidence of those subsequent acts was led by the Crown as context, not as tendency, evidence.

97In Dann, this Court (Spigelman CJ, Heydon JA, and James J) was taken by the Crown prosecutor to the statement by Ireland J in R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 709; (1997) 98 A Crim R 71 at 78 that ""[i]f the conduct in question is not remote from the time of the alleged offence, the Crown should usually have little difficulty in establishing that the evidence has importance in establishing the guilt of the accused, and thus that it is of significant probative value"". Reference was also made to statements in R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 522, 523 and 525, to the effect that subsequent sexual activity is less weighty than previous sexual activity.

R v Beserick

98In Beserick, there were two separate trials involving two different complainants against the one appellant. The first trial was for one count of indecent assault but evidence was also led of three to four years of subsequent sexual activity of an increasingly serious nature. The second trial related to two particular incidents but evidence was also led as to at least ten subsequent occasions when sexual activity had occurred. Hunt CJ at CL said (at 523) that:

...In general, the weight to be afforded to subsequent sexual activity will be less than that afforded to previous sexual activity, hence the proper exercise of discretion will more readily favour the admission of evidence of the previous rather than the subsequent kind. (emphasis per original)

99At 525, his Honour said:

It could not usually be said that the evidence of subsequent sexual activity is relevant in order to place in its proper context the evidence of the earlier activity upon which the offence charged is based. I am not prepared to say that it could never be relevant for that purpose, but the cases in which it would be relevant for that purpose must surely be unusual ones. (emphasis per original)

100His Honour also noted at 521-522 that remoteness of other sexual activity from the time of the offence charged went to the weight of the evidence and considered it to be a matter of commonsense that weight to be afforded to subsequent sexual activity would be less than that afforded to previous sexual activity. There, his Honour was addressing the admissibility of evidence going to the existence of a ""guilty passion"" or sexual feeling or desire between the appellant and the complainants. His Honour accepted that regard might be had to subsequent behaviour in order to indicate a state of mind existing at an earlier time (referring, inter alia, to Herald and Weekly Times Ltd v McGregor (1928) 41 CLR 254 at 265; Simpson v Robinson (1848) 12 QB 511 at 513; 116 ER 959 at 960).

101In Dann, Heydon JA (as his Honour then was), with whom Spigelman CJ and James J concurred, concluded that the probative value of the evidence of the later uncharged acts was slight, noting what had been said in Beserick. There were, however, a number of factors to which his Honour referred (at [36]) in Dann as rendering of slight weight the probative value of the evidence, not just the fact that the incidents in question were later in time. His Honour noted that the evidence as to the later incidents was ""vague in time and particularity in every respect"" and that, so far as they were particular, the details were ""conflicting and unconvincing to a degree"".

102His Honour commented on the strange way in which the stepson's evidence of the first of the later incidents had ended (with a wholly non-responsive answer) and the bizarre character of the second incident; and compared the very brief way in which evidence of the later incidents had been given with the more detailed evidence of the incidents with which the appellant had been charged. His Honour also noted that the fact that the evidence was tendered only as giving a context or background meant that it had to meet less rigorous tests than those created by s 97 and that its probative value was correspondingly less.

103His Honour concluded, at [37], that the evidence ought to have been rejected, saying that:

... Its low probative value was exceeded by the unfairness caused by a multiplication of questionably established discreditable instances. Though the jury were warned not to use the evidence as tendency evidence, only as relationship evidence, the distinction is difficult to grasp at the best of times. The vagueness of the evidence, particularly as to date, made it prejudicial in the sense that it was difficult for the accused to respond to it except by a denial. (my emphasis)

104Here, the evidence of the admitted conduct against Lisa did not have the bizarre character of that in Dann, nor could it be said to be vague or unconvincing insofar as it comprised conduct admitted by the appellant himself. Criticism is made by the appellant of the reliability of both Jane and Kay's evidence (to which I refer in due course). Nevertheless, that evidence did not suffer from the same difficulties as the context evidence in Dann. Even though there was inconsistency in the evidence as to the time the conduct complained of by Jane and Kay took place, there was sufficient particularity as to the place of the conduct and other matters placing the conduct in a temporal context to make it possible for the appellant to respond to it otherwise than by a mere denial.

105Though the appellant had admitted his conduct against Lisa, it was still necessary for the jury to consider whether it was satisfied that such conduct established a tendency, as contended for by the Crown, and whether, if so, this was capable of establishing that one or both of Jane and Kay was truthful in her allegations; i.e., that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any such tendency existed at an earlier time and that the appellant had acted upon it as alleged. The Crown contended that it could, because of the high likelihood that such a sexual preference would manifest in similar circumstances between the various complainants and hence that, if the appellant behaved in a particular way with one girl, he was likely to have behaved earlier in the same way with the other girls.

106To the extent that this involves an assessment as to the likelihood that the conduct towards Lisa was an isolated instance (or set of incidents) or the first time that the appellant had acted on any tendency that the jury was satisfied was established by that conduct, the jury would be expected to approach this having regard to all of the other evidence before it, including any evidence that might suggest a particular explanation for the tendency only to have manifested itself at a late stage in the appellant's family life (such as the evidence that emerged of his treatment for depression in around 2002/2003). 

107I note that the appellant's evidence was that he did not know why he had committed the acts against Lisa. His only explanation was that ""[i]t was a lack of judgment at the time"" and, later, that at the time he was ""deeply depressed"". This is despite the fact that the appellant accepted that in a statement dated 16 October 2009 which he had given to the police and to DOCS (in which he acknowledged that ""about 3 years ago [he] inappropriately touched"" Lisa) he had said: ""[w]hen I examined my behaviour I believe that it was prompted by feelings of a need for closeness"". At the trial, the appellant agreed that his feelings at the time were of closeness to Lisa.

108The jury was able to take that evidence into account as well as the explanations proffered by the appellant's wife for that conduct in her 2009 letter to DOCS, to which I will refer shortly, when determining whether a tendency had been established of the kind the Crown contended the appellant had.

R v Thomas Douglas Watkins

109In Watkins, the appellant was found guilty of offences relating to the deposit by him to the credit of his own bank account company cheques with intent to cheat and defraud the company. He was the financial administrator and accountant of the company, with responsibility for the preparation of cheques for the payment of creditors' accounts. He did not have authority to sign the cheques. The defence case was that the appellant had written the cheques in question with the approval of the company on the basis that he had been instructed to pay a single cheque into his own account and then disburse amounts from that account for the payment of individual creditors.

110The tendency evidence on which the Crown there relied included the appellant's conduct in earlier defrauding another company (by which he had been employed) by drawing cheques to cash. In that case, he was one authorised signatory and got the signature of the second authorised signatory by representing that the cheques were required urgently and the other signatory signed in good faith and the cheques were drawn by someone else using a printer and paid out to cash; whereas in the later case he was not an authorised signatory, the cheques were drawn to himself and handwritten by him. There was also a dissimilarity in the manner in which the proceeds of the stolen moneys had been used. The earlier frauds had occurred in 1983 and 1984; the later ones in 1999 to 2002. There was evidence of the appellant's reputation and good conduct in the intervening period.

111Barr J accepted (at [33]) that if a person is proved to have stolen money from one employer 37 times over a year, misleading other employees by his lies, he might be understood to have a tendency to cheat and defraud his employer and said that, no doubt, a person in whom such a tendency is established might be expected to retain that tendency for some time ""especially if he continues to occupy a similar position ... and has similar duties"". His Honour also noted that people do reform and considered that the fact that there was no dishonest act asserted between 1984 and 1999, coupled with the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty and returned all the money stolen from the employer in 1983/4, ""might have thrown doubt on the continuation of his tendency for a period as long as fifteen years"".

112At [35], his Honour said that there was no logical connection between the events of 1983/4 and the later events; and that the only way in which the jury could have used tendency evidence was to reason that he was a cheat and a fraud and therefore more likely to have cheated and defrauded his later employer. At [36], Barr J noted that the jury could only so reason if the appellant had retained such tendency as was demonstrated by the earlier events and that critical to that question was the passage of fifteen years without asserted blemish. His Honour noted that the trial judge had failed to refer to the argument by Counsel for the accused that this affected the probative value of the evidence and that the failure to refer to this argument and to the passage of time suggested that those matters were overlooked.

113As to the balancing of probative value against prejudicial effect, Barr J noted at [49] that the difficulty about the evidence was the risk to which it gave rise that the jury would be overwhelmed by the knowledge that the appellant had been convicted of a series of frauds on a previous employer and would refuse to contemplate the appellant's defence to the similar charges before them. His Honour said at [50]:

It seems to me that there was a real danger that the jury's recognition of the appellant's prior guilt was likely to divert them from a proper consideration of the evidence as bearing on the question of his intent in the charges before them. The difficulty of obviating that risk had to be taken into account in assessing the likely prejudicial effect of the evidence.

114Ultimately, his Honour concluded at [51] that the probative value of the evidence was bound to be heavily qualified and weighed that against the serious risk of prejudice and the difficulty of removing it by direction to the jury. His Honour considered that it was not open to the trial judge to conclude that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect on the appellant and that the evidence ought not to have been admitted.

115In the present case, there was a reasonable similarity in the circumstances of the respective acts in that they took place in the family home, when the complainants were in bed (either at night or in the morning) and the acts involved touching and feeling the complainants' breasts and/or genital area. Certainly, there were difference as between the particular sexual acts, to which I will refer shortly, but the conduct as a whole had greater similarity than the different acts relied upon in Watkins.

116It was not the case, as adverted to in Watkins, that there had been a 15 year period with no asserted misconduct. Rather, it was a case where the gap in time between asserted acts of misconduct was explicable having regard to the relative ages of the complainants and their sequential placement in the appellant's care.

117Thus the lack of misconduct in the intervening periods does not (as it did in Watkins) assist the appellant, given the absence of another foster daughter in the relevant age range during much of that 14 year period between the conduct against Jane and that against Kay.

Other authorities

118Reliance was also placed by the appellant on R v Fung [2002] NSWCCA 479; 136 A Crim R 95 and TWL v R [2012] NSWCCA 57. 

119In Fung, Sully J, with whom Beazley JA, as her Honour then was, and RS Hulme J agreed, was unable to see how proof of illicit drug dealings some 4 months after the charged offence had any rational part to play in the drawing of an inference beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had particular knowledge in connection with an earlier transaction. Relevantly, his Honour emphasised that this was even more the case when the evidence did not suggest in any way whatsoever any connection of the appellant with the later transactions (see at [49]).

120In TWL, Macfarlan JA, with whom RA Hulme and Garling JJ agreed, considered that evidence of statements by the appellant in the week leading up to the charged incident (that he only went to the local show to get into fights and that Friday night was fight night), relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence to suggest a tendency of the appellant to engage in violent behaviour, were not sufficiently proximate to the assault to be probative of the appellant's state of mind at the time of the offence.

121As the appellant accepts, those cases do not take the matter any further than the authorities referred to earlier.

R v SK

122Reliance was placed by the Crown on the approach in this Court in R v SK. There, Latham J, with whom Giles JA and Rothman J agreed (the latter expressing additional comments as to the distinction between tendency and coincidence evidence), considered that the lapse of time between the alleged assaults on the respective complainants in that case (occurring over a lengthy period between 1980 and 2003) was a powerful factor in reasoning towards the commission of the offences charged. The offences comprised sexual assaults by the complainants' uncle; the sexual activity occurred in the appellant's home during regular family gatherings; and the Crown case was that the appellant relied upon social visits to his home by members of his extended family in order to obtain access to young children. It was alleged that the appellant commenced assaulting each complainant at or about the age of 6 or 7 and ceased assaulting them about the age of 13, once the children reached an age when the appellant could no longer exercise influence over them or they commenced to assert themselves.

123At [26], her Honour concluded that ""[f]ar from depriving the evidence of its capacity for probative value, the temporal gaps are an integral part of the appellant's underlying pattern of behaviour"". So it is in the present case. 

124The Crown case was, in effect, that the tendency evidence demonstrated a pattern of behaviour on the part of the appellant in relation to young girls in his care, whereby he abused them sequentially while they were in a particular age range and then either lost interest in them or events occurred that caused him to cease his abuse of them. While, in the case of Jane, it might be inferred that the appellant lost interest in her once she reached a particular stage of development; in the case of both Kay and Lisa, there seems to have been an obvious reason for the appellant to have ceased abuse (namely, the notification to DOCS in 2003 - in the case of Kay - notwithstanding that this did not result in further action at the time, and, in the case of Lisa, the witnessing by his wife of the last incident with Lisa and disclosure by Lisa, leading to the 2007 family meeting and subsequent notification by Lisa to DOCS).

Conclusion as to effect, on probative value of the tendency evidence, of temporal gap between the events 

125As to the tendency evidence tendered in relation to the count involving Kay, in my opinion it was not an invitation to engage in an impermissible process of reasoning for the jury to be asked to conclude that, if the jury were satisfied that the admitted conduct towards Lisa in 2005-2006 established beyond reasonable doubt the tendency claimed by the Crown (a matter of which the trial judge made clear it was for the jury to be satisfied), then it was likely that the appellant had a similar tendency or state of mind a mere 2-3 years' earlier (when the incident of which Kay complained was said to have occurred) and hence that the jury should have the requisite level of satisfaction that Kay's complaint was made truthfully, taking into account for that purpose the other evidence relevant on that issue. 

126As a matter of commonsense, when considering the import of the admitted conduct towards Lisa, there were at least two contradictory possibilities: that the conduct in 2005/2006 was the commencement of an isolated series of events precipitated by a particular attraction to Lisa (or some other factor) or that the conduct in 2005/2006 was the manifestation of a tendency that the appellant had at an earlier time (on which he may or may not have acted at that earlier time). 

127If the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the conduct against Jane, then that could also reasonably be taken into account in the jury's assessment of whether Kay's complaint was truthful, since it would provide evidence of a tendency (consistent with that evidenced by the conduct against Lisa) on which the appellant had been prepared to act at that earlier stage.

128As to the tendency evidence tendered in relation to the counts involving Jane, even accepting that the weight of the much later conduct admitted against Lisa was lessened by the passage of time between those events, the jury also had before it the evidence of conduct against Kay which (if the jury found beyond reasonable doubt was established) would strengthen the conclusion that Jane's complaints of similar conduct were established.

129The evidence of subsequent admitted conduct against Lisa was not something that could be dismissed as not having significant probative value. It did not suffer from the deficiencies of the evidence of subsequent sexual activity in Dann; nor was it so removed in a factual or temporal context from the earlier acts as in Watkins, particularly given that in the present case (whichever version of Kay's disclosure in 2003 were to be accepted) it could not be said that there had been no asserted acts of inappropriate sexual misconduct in the intervening period between the conduct against Jane and the conduct against Lisa. The same conclusions follow in relation to the tendency evidence of Kay. In relation to the evidence of Jane as tendency evidence in relation to the count involving Kay, the submission based on the temporal gap was, in effect, conceded to have less force, since this was prior sexual activity albeit not within a confined time period.

130Given that the gaps between the respective assaults were explicable if the tendency was, as the Crown contended, one that related to girls of a particular age range, having regard to the sequential placement of the girls into the appellant's care, this was precisely the kind of evidence that in SK the Court accepted could be relevant and of probative value. 

Difference in nature of the acts

131The second factor that is said by the appellant to have diminished the probative value of the tendency evidence is the difference in the particular acts relied on by the Crown to establish tendency. The appellant accepts that the Hoch test does not apply as a matter of strict exclusion but submits that the less similar the acts the less probative they are as tendency evidence. 

132The differences to which the appellant points are the age at which the appellant commenced, and/or ceased, to act upon the alleged sexual interest in his foster daughters and the particular behaviour of which complaint was made.

133As to the first, namely, the differences in the age of the respective complainants at the time of the alleged offences, Jane's evidence (though inconsistent in parts) was that she was 9 years' old when the alleged offences commenced and that the conduct ""eased off'' as she reached puberty, ceasing when she was 14 years' old; whereas the acts against Kay and Lisa did not commence until each was 11 or 12 years' old (by which time, at least in Lisa's case, she had then reached puberty).

134In the case of Kay, her recollection was that at the time of the first (uncharged) incident, the conduct felt ""familiar"" to her, which leaves open the possibility that the time of commencement of the abuse may have been at a younger age. In the case of Jane, if the appellant's criticism of the reliability of Jane's memory as to her age, at the time the alleged offences commenced has force, then she would have been much closer in age to the other complainants when the abuse commenced. There may not, therefore, be as marked a difference in the age of the complainants at the time of the alleged conduct as the appellant suggests.

135In any event, in the case of each of the complainants, the alleged (or in the case of Lisa, admitted) conduct either commenced or continued while she was around 11-12 years' old. By 11-12 years' old, each was at, or approaching, puberty. This is not a case where there is such a dissimilarity in the ages of the complainants, at the time the conduct commenced, as to deprive the evidence of significant probative value. Similarly, little can be drawn from the ages at which the conduct ceased, since there were commonsense explanations for the conduct against Kay and Lisa to have ceased when it did (and perhaps at a time earlier than might otherwise have been the case), there being in each case an incident that drew attention within the family to untoward conduct on the part of the appellant (and, in the case of Kay, a formal notification to DOCS), that might well be expected to have had an effect on curbing the appellant's behaviour in relation to each of the complainants at the respective times in question.

136As to the second matter raised, namely the type of behaviour alleged, the appellant raises three points of difference.

137Apart from the difference in the ages of the complainants at the time of the alleged offences, to which I have referred above, the appellant points to the absence of complaint as to grooming behaviour towards Lisa or Kay, unlike the ""tickle fights"" in relation to Jane. However, all three of the complainants at some point in their evidence made reference to tickling behaviour in connection with the abuse. In Lisa's police interview, she referred to the appellant tickling her, saying that ""...he'd just tickle me. He'd just start tickling me or something and then he'd just put his hands under my shirt and just touch my breasts"". Kay's evidence of the second (uncharged) incident was that it also commenced by tickling on the part of the appellant (albeit tickling of her back at her request). Therefore, tickling was an aspect about the appellant's conduct towards each of the complainants and the absence of evidence of ""tickle fights"" as grooming behaviour in advance of the commencement of the later abuse is not a significant difference. The appellant conceded that he had tickled children in the family, though denying that he had done so inappropriately.

138Further, the appellant points to the fact that Lisa and Kay (unlike Jane) did not claim to have been subjected to digital penetration and to the difference between the appellant's admitted conduct in relation to Lisa (touching and placing his mouth on Lisa's breasts) whereas Kay denied that he had ever touched her breasts.

139There were certainly differences in the particular acts of which the respective complainants gave evidence, the most marked of which was the lack of digital penetration of two of the three complainants and the fact that the appellant was not said to have placed his mouth on the breast (or any other part of the body) of two of the three complainants. What is common to all of the counts is that there was inappropriate touching of some kind of the body, in Jane's case her breasts and her vagina; in Kay's case her vagina, but not breasts; and in Lisa's case her breasts and vagina. (It should be noted that the appellant denied touching Lisa's vagina but in the agreed facts the appellant admitted to having placed his hand on top of her vagina and having kept his hand on her ""pull-ups"" for some time before removing it).

140Furthermore, other than the unproven count involving Jane, each of the acts took place in a bed (and, in all but the first uncharged incident involving Kay, in the child's own bed); most of the incidents happened at night; and both Kay and Lisa referred to incidents occurring on nights when the appellant came to their bedroom after returning from Lions Club meetings.

141The differences in question were clearly matters to be taken into account in the assessment of the complainants' evidence but in my opinion they did not significantly reduce the probative value of the tendency evidence in light of the overwhelming similarity in the circumstances in which the acts occurred.

142In R v PWD [2010] NSWCCA 209; (2010) 205 A Crim R 75, Beazley JA, as her Honour then was (with whom Buddin J and Barr AJ agreed) said (at [79]) ""[t]he authorities are clear that for evidence to be admissible under s 97 there does not have to be striking similarities, or even closely similar behaviour"", there contrasting the position with coincidence evidence. In that case, the evidence sought to be relied upon, which her Honour accepted was capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability that the accused had engaged in the conduct alleged and had a sexual interest in so doing, was of conduct towards students who were boarders and who were vulnerable because they were homesick or did not fit in with the normal pattern of school life in various ways. Her Honour considered that the evidence had significant probative value in the determination of the question whether the individual allegations should be accepted.

143Similarly, in the present case, the tendency evidence (if accepted by the jury) would demonstrate that the appellant had a tendency sexually to abuse young girls who were vulnerable in the sense that they had been removed from troubled households and placed in his and his wife's foster care. The differences in the particular acts complained of by the respective complainants do not diminish the significant probative value of their evidence.

Contamination/concoction 

144In relation to the admission of Lisa's evidence as tendency evidence to prove the conduct complained of by Kay, it is further submitted by the appellant that the probative value of that evidence was diminished because there was a real chance of concoction or contamination in relation to Kay's evidence, as a result of her communications and relationship with Lisa (a matter also relied upon in relation to the unreasonable verdict ground of appeal in relation to count 7). 

145The appellant points to the following: that Kay and Lisa shared the same house from 1994 to 2008, which included a period of at least 2 years after the disclosure by Lisa; that Kay admitted having had conversations with Lisa at the time of the incident involving Lisa in 2007, when Kay said to Lisa, in effect, that she had also been abused and when Lisa (either at the same time or in a later conversation that day) disclosed some detail of the abuse that had occurred to her (namely, that the appellant ""put his mouth on my boob and asked me if I liked it""); and that Kay also admitted having had a later conversation with Lisa about the conduct (although Kay said that they had not discussed what had happened but just that Lisa was upset about it). This is said not only to demonstrate the relationship between the complainants and opportunity for contamination or concoction of their evidence but also to provide evidence of the making of actual disclosures. 

146The appellant contends that the inconsistencies in Kay's evidence as to what was in fact disclosed by her to Lisa point to a real risk of contamination of the evidence. 

147First, the appellant places significance on the difference in the order in which Kay put the sequence of her statement to Lisa (that the appellant had done the same thing to her too) and Lisa's statement to her (that the appellant had put his mouth on her breast and asked if she liked it). At the voir dire hearing, Kay said that when the appellant's wife told her, in effect, that the appellant had done to Lisa what he had done to her she had immediately gone to Lisa and said ""that happened to me too"". That statement was not put as having been a response to Lisa's disclosure that the appellant had put his mouth on her breast. It was put to Kay in cross-examination that this was inconsistent with her police statement (where the ""that happened to me too"" statement followed Lisa's disclosure) and that Kay had reversed the sequence of those statements in order to avoid the inconsistency arising from her denial that the appellant had touched her breasts.

148The appellant also points to the inconsistency between Kay's statement that Lisa had told her the appellant ""asked me if I liked it"" and Lisa's evidence that she could not understand anything the appellant had said to her during his abuse of her.

149As to the 'reversal' of the order in which the disclosures were made between Kay and Lisa on that particular day in 2007, Kay was cross-examined at the trial as to the difference between the two versions. It is apparent from the transcript that she did not understand what was suggested to be the significance of the order of the statements, which dispels the notion that this was something done in order to overcome a recognition by Kay of inconsistency between her police statement and her later evidence. Moreover, there is no obvious reason for Kay to have concocted a version of events involving the touching of her vagina if what had occurred was a touching of her breasts.

150There is no incongruity in Kay's statement (that her father had done the same thing to her preceding a statement by Lisa as to what he had done to her) if, as Kay alleges, she had just been told by the appellant's wife that what had happened to her had also happened to Lisa. No doubt Kay would have concluded from that at the least that Lisa had been inappropriately touched. It is by no means apparent that she would necessarily have focussed on where on her body Lisa had been touched. Even if the order of the respective statements was as set out in the police statement version of events, a statement that ""he did that to me too"" could have been intended, and taken as, no more than a reference to inappropriate touching of the body. 

151Indeed, the difference between the conduct admitted to having taken place against Lisa (involving touching her breasts) and the conduct complained of by Kay (involving touching only her vagina) tells against contamination or concoction of Kay's evidence by reference to any disclosure made by Lisa to her. Further, Kay's immediate reaction to this disclosure is consistent with Kay having been subjected in 2003 to more than an inadvertent contact by the appellant.

152As to the evidence by Lisa as to whether the appellant had said anything intelligible to her during the events in question, the significance of the inconsistency between this and Kay's account of the disclosure in 2007 relates to the fact that Kay's complaint as to the first specific incident she recalled was that her father had asked whether she liked what he was doing.

153While Lisa was unable to recall, in her police interview, what the appellant had said to her while committing the offences, she gave varying responses that indicated that her father had said things to her but that she did not know if she could understand what he had said or if she had just blocked it out and that his voice ""just made me sick"" and she referred to the appellant ""crooning to me like he'd talk to a baby or something"". This raises the possibility that, some years closer to the event and in a context where Lisa was not under the pressure of the later police interview, Lisa may have recalled at least that the appellant had said something of this kind to her and had told Kay this. There is also the possibility that Kay's recollection of the disclosure by Lisa to her was affected by Kay's memory of what the appellant had said during the earlier incident involving Kay. What it cannot suggest, if Lisa was in fact unable at any time to recall anything intelligible said to her by the appellant during the admitted conduct against her, is that Kay's recollection of the earlier event was contaminated by a disclosure that on this hypothesis Lisa could not have made.

154Kay's evidence, accepted by Finnane DCJ on the voir dire, was that she had not disclosed to Lisa the detail of the appellant's misconduct. This was consistent with Lisa's evidence. Both Lisa and Kay were cross-examined as to this issue in the voir dire hearing. Taken together with: first, the sparsity of the detail of abuse about which Kay was forthcoming when disclosing to Mary in 2007, in the presence of Lisa, that the appellant had molested both Lisa and herself; second, the silence of Lisa at the subsequent family meeting; and, third, the differences in the accounts given by each of Kay and Lisa as to what happened to them, the inconsistency to which the appellant points as to whether the appellant had said anything during the abuse of Lisa does not in my opinion demonstrate a real risk of contamination or concoction of Kay's evidence by reference to anything Lisa said to her.

155Third, the appellant points to Lisa's evidence that Kay had disclosed to her that the abuse to Kay had started in year seven and had happened ""a couple of times"" as well as her evidence that, on the day Kay found out (about the incident with Lisa) ""she sat down with [the appellant's wife] and told her all the times it had happened and how many times"" but that when Kay first told the appellant's wife she said it had only happened once. It is suggested that this demonstrates further communications between Kay and Lisa since Kay's evidence at trial was that she had only told Lisa that the same thing had happened to her too. 

156From a review of the transcript of Lisa's interview with the police, it seems that the main thing that Lisa recalled of the disclosure to her (on the day of the 2006 incident involving Lisa) was that Kay had run into the caravan. Lisa's other answers as to what Kay had told the appellant's wife read as someone making assumptions as to what was said. They do not disclose a real risk of contamination of the evidence in this respect. It was not suggested that Lisa was present on those occasions and Kay herself was unable to recall more than three specific incidents at the time of trial. There is no suggestion by Kay that she had disclosed more incidents to the appellant's wife on the day she had locked herself in the ""caravan"". None of this points to any specific detail being exchanged by Kay and Lisa as to the acts that had occurred.

157In summary, the appellant submits that the matters referred to above demonstrate that there was not only a relationship between the complainants and the opportunity for contamination of their evidence but also that there were actual exchanges of information, such as to point to a real risk of concoction or contamination of Kay's evidence. The appellant further suggests that there was motive (presumably for concoction of the evidence by Kay) on the basis that Kay was estranged from the appellant at the time she gave her first particularised complaint on the voir dire before Finnane DCJ. It was not, however, put to Kay that her evidence had been motivated by animosity towards the appellant and, indeed, Kay's explanation for delay in making the complaint was that she had forgiven the appellant (and it was accepted by the appellant that Kay was a person of religious faith, which makes such an explanation more credible).

158There is no doubt that there was opportunity for contamination of evidence; however, both Kay and Lisa were adamant that no detail was exchanged between the two as to the particular conduct of which Kay later gave details. As already noted, when the disclosure was made to Mary in 2007, Mary's evidence was that Kay said no more than that the appellant had taken something from them and had ""molested"" them both (and that Lisa had said nothing at all on that occasion). As to the relationship between the two, Kay's evidence at the voir dire was that the two had not been that close and that the subsequent discussion at the music festival was as to how Lisa still was upset about the incident, not what had happened.

159The question of contamination or concoction of evidence was explored at length on the voir dire hearing. The inconsistencies to which the appellant now points in the evidence of Kay and Lisa as to the content of the disclosure(s) made by Kay and Lisa to each other were explored also in detail at the trial. There was not, in my opinion, shown to be such a risk of contamination or concoction of Kay's evidence, as to lessen its probative value to the degree that it could not be said to be significant.

Earlier uncharged acts

160As to ground 6, it is submitted that, in considering whether to admit the evidence of the two earlier incidents complained of by Kay for a tendency purpose, it was incumbent on the Court to consider whether those incidents had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. As authority for this proposition, the appellant refers to DJV v R [2008] NSWCA 272; (2008) 200 A Crim R 206 at [30]. The appellant notes that this was not an issue argued before Finnane DCJ.

161In DJV, McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Hidden and Fullerton JJ agreed, considered an appeal from conviction on two counts of sexual offences relating to the appellant's daughter. The Crown had led evidence from the complainant of other sexual misconduct by her father. Although tendency notices were initially served, the evidence was ultimately led as relationship or context evidence. The appellant complained that the admission of that evidence resulted in an unfair trial and contended that the trial judge had misdirected the jury on the use to be made of the evidence.

162At [30], McClellan CJ at CL confirmed that in sexual assault cases the appropriate standard of proof of tendency evidence was the beyond reasonable doubt standard, saying:

The need for care in identifying the basis upon which the evidence is admitted, either tendency or context, must be emphasised. In HML, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Kiefel JJ state (see Hayne at [247]) that where evidence is tendered to prove a propensity, being the sexual interest of an accused in a complainant, the jury must be told that they must be satisfied of that interest beyond reasonable doubt ... 

there referring to HML v R [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334. 

163The appellant submits that evidence of the earlier uncharged incidents should not have been admitted because they could not have occurred at the time that Kay says they did (the first being when the appellant's wife was in hospital and the second shortly after the first in bedroom 2). That is because, on the agreed statement of facts, the appellant's wife did not receive any treatment from any hospital until 2000 and, by then, Kay had not occupied the bedroom in which the second incident was said to have occurred for 2 or 3 years (having moved to bedroom 5 when Lisa arrived in 1997).

164The inconsistency between the time at which it was accepted that Kay occupied bedroom 2 (1994-1997) and the times at which she placed the earlier incidents (by reference to the hospitalisation of the appellant's wife, which was agreed was not until 2000) was not a matter explored at the time of the voir dire hearing. At that time, Kay stated that she was not sure which bedroom she occupied at the time of the earlier incidents, only that it was in a different bed to the bed in which count 7 occurred.

165The appellant's wife was unsure at exactly what age Kay had occupied bedroom 2. Moreover, the appellant said he had a ""vague recollection"" of Kay coming into his room one night, which gave some credence to Kay's recollection of the first uncharged incident occurring when she had gone to the appellant's bed.

166Uncertainty as to the dates on which the earlier incidents occurred was not something that necessarily raised sufficient doubt as to whether the incidents had occurred so as to preclude reliance on them as tendency evidence by a jury properly instructed as to the need for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to those acts. It could have been explained by a mistake as to the timing of one or other of those incidents that did not reflect adversely on Kay's credit.

167There was in my opinion no error in a conclusion that the evidence of the uncharged earlier incidents was of significant probative value. 

Prejudicial effect

168The above discussion has addressed whether the matters raised by the appellant demonstrate that the tendency evidence had diminished probative value. I have concluded that they do not and that, to the contrary, the tendency evidence had significant probative value. Its admission, therefore, depended on whether it substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect flowing therefrom.

169Clearly, there was a risk that the tendency evidence would have a prejudicial effect on the appellant. As noted by Latham J in R v SK, there is a generic prejudice inherent in tendency evidence, namely, that a jury will conclude that a person with an established tendency will yield to the tendency whenever the opportunity arises (at [28]) (see also R v AH, citing Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7; (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 488). There, however, her Honour also noted that it had not been suggested that the jury might use the tendency evidence in any way logically unconnected with the issue in the trial, as to whether the appellant had committed the assaults against each complainant. The same comment may be made in the present case.
170As earlier noted, the appellant submits that in this case, there was a particular prejudice to him because of the plea of guilty in relation to the offences against Lisa. It is submitted that this made it almost impossible for the appellant to be accepted as a credible, reliable person (because of the smear over his head arising from his admission of guilt in relation to those charges). The appellant submits that this is illustrated by the emphasis placed by the Crown in closing submissions on the plea of guilty in the context of the submission that he was not a credible witness, in saying:

... I suggested to him a number of times when I was cross-examining him that he was pretending not to remember very important conversations and that he was telling lies about certain things and I say that those lies and those things that he was pretending not to remember go to his credibility. You would disregard him as a witness without credibility. Why do I say that? Because at the very beginning of his evidence, I suggested he had the sexual interest in the children. He sexually and indecently abused girls in his care and he used his position of foster father in order to gain access to them. He denied those things, one, two three. He had to deny those things because if he admitted those things, you would think he had the sexual interest and therefore he committed the acts upon [Jane] and [Kay]. His problem was he has already admitted what he did to [Lisa].

The Crown then reminded the jury that at trial the appellant had admitted only to placing his mouth on one breast (inconsistently with the agreed facts) and had denied other matters admitted in the agreed facts. 

171True it is that the admission of the appellant's guilt was there used to illustrate the lack of credibility of the accused. However, it was not the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty to the particular offences against Lisa that the Crown was suggesting made him not a credible witness. Rather, the submission was that the appellant's denial (of having a sexual interest in children; having sexually and indecently abused girls in his care; and having used his position as a foster father to gain access to them) at the outset of the cross-examination was inconsistent with the admission that he had committed the acts upon Lisa to which he pleaded guilty (and hence that his denial of the alleged tendency was not credible). At least insofar as the appellant's conduct against Lisa established one or more of those propositions, then clearly the appellant's denial could not be credible. The appellant could, of course, have denied one or all of them as a general proposition, on the basis that the conduct against Lisa was an isolated act and perhaps denied a sexual interest in young girls, on the basis that there was some other explanation for his conduct against Lisa. However, that is not the point. What the Crown was there inviting the jury to conclude was that the appellant's denial of those (and other matters) was not credible, not that the guilty plea of itself meant that he had no credibility.

172Before tendency evidence can be relied upon at all, the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the acts in question did occur and that, taken with all the evidence, they established the relevant tendency. All that the evidence of the appellant's admissions as to his conduct towards Lisa did was to remove from the jury the need to consider whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the particular events the subject of the offences involving Lisa had occurred (not whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they established a tendency on the part of the appellant nor whether the existence of such a tendency in 2005/2006, taken into account with all the other evidence, enabled them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the allegations by one or both of Kay and Lisa had been proven). 

173The evidence of the guilty plea in respect of Lisa was not, in my opinion, evidence the admission of which was potentially so prejudicial as substantially to outweigh its probative value. Therefore, there was no error in the admission of that evidence in the trial relating to the complaints by Kay and Lisa.

174The very differences in the conduct the subject of the various complaints and the temporal gap between the offences against Lisa (matters relied upon by the appellant to argue that the probative value of the evidence was diminished) are matters that tend against any conclusion that the plea of guilty would so smear the appellant as to deprive him of any credibility such that a properly directed jury could not be expected to be capable of properly assessing that tendency evidence.

175As I will discuss in the context of grounds 7-8, it seems likely that the real damage to the appellant's credibility came from the fact that, in the witness box, he appeared to resile from the admissions that he had made as to the conduct against Lisa.

176As Beazley JA said in R v PWD (at [90]), when considering whether the probative value of tendency evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect, the Court is entitled to take into account that juries are to be properly directed as to the use to which such evidence is to be put. The admission as to conduct the subject of particular offences in 2005/2006 was not in my opinion such as to make it impossible for the appellant to be accepted as a credible witness in relation to other alleged offences involving different complainants at different times, particularly where there were differences (to which the appellant pointed) as to the precise nature and circumstances of the alleged conduct.

177In relation to the other evidence relied on as tendency evidence (i.e., evidence of Jane in relation to the count involving Kay and vice versa), the appellant conceded that the submission that was made as to the potential prejudicial effect of the plea of guilty could not be made with the same force. In my opinion, the strong probative value of that evidence substantially outweighed the potential prejudice having regard to the expectation that any prejudice arising from the nature of the tendency evidence could be adequately dealt with by appropriate directions from the trial judge.

Conclusion

178In summary, having regard to the reasons set out above, my conclusions as to the particular grounds of appeal in relation to the tendency evidence are as follows.

179As to grounds 1 and 4, his Honour did not err in concluding that the tendency evidence of Lisa was of significant probative value in the assessment of whether the appellant had committed the offences charged against each of Jane and Kay. There was no suggestion of any real risk of contamination of Jane's evidence by reference to the evidence of Lisa; and the evidence of Kay and Lisa did not support a conclusion that the evidence of Kay had been contaminated by the latter. The temporal gap between the respective offences, while much greater in the case of the complaint by Jane, did not weaken the probative value of Lisa's evidence to such an extent that its probative value did not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect of that evidence. The prejudicial effect was not more than the ordinary prejudice that flows from the nature of tendency evidence and was capable of being addressed by an appropriate jury direction. Grounds 1 and 4 are not made out.

180As to ground 6, there was sufficient probative value in the evidence by Kay of the two earlier uncharged incidents for them to be capable of being relied upon as tendency evidence and hence ground 6 is not made out. As to ground 3, I reach the same conclusion as to the probative force of Kay's evidence substantially outweighing its prejudicial effect as that reached in relation to Lisa's evidence. I note that the temporal gap between the acts complained of by Kay and those complained of by Jane is somewhat less than the temporal gap between the acts relating to Lisa/Jane. Further, the arguments relied upon by the appellant as to the irreparable prejudice from the fact of the guilty plea do not apply to the tendency evidence of Kay. Grounds 3 and 6 are not made out.

181As to ground 5, the complaint as to reliance on subsequent activity does not apply in relation to this ground, since the evidence of Jane was in relation to acts prior to those complained of by Kay. Nor does the particular emphasis placed on the guilty plea in relation to Lisa have any application to this ground of appeal. I see no error by Finnane DCJ in concluding that the evidence of Jane had significant probative value in the determination of whether the appellant committed the offence charged in count 7 of the indictment and that its probative value substantially outweighed the ordinary prejudicial effect attendant upon admission of tendency evidence. Ground 5 is not made out.

182I am satisfied that the tendency evidence as a whole had significant probative value and that it substantially outweighed its potential prejudicial effect. There was no error established in the ruling by Finnane DCJ that that evidence was admissible. 

Grounds 7-8 - unreasonable verdict grounds

183Turning to the unreasonable verdict grounds of appeal, the Crown made reference to the test set out in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493, as to whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty; and to what was said in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 623-624 [58] as to the application of that test in the context of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

184Section 6(1) of that Act provides that:

The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 

185In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13, (2011) 243 CLR 400, the High Court (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ (Heydon and Crennan JJ dissenting)) confirmed that what is required in such a case, applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, is that the Court make an independent assessment of the evidence both as to its sufficiency and quality ([14]) in order to determine ""whether the evidence was such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged"" ([21]).

186Their Honours made it clear that it was necessary for the appellate court to make an independent assessment of the evidence, weighing the competing evidence, but that, having done so, the task that the appellate court was required to perform was that of concluding whether ""it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant"".

Review of the evidence given by the appellant and his wife

187Before turning to the respects in which the appellant contends that the verdicts were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence, I will address the evidence given by the appellant and his wife in the proceedings and, in particular, the critical respects in which their evidence was not credible (accepting, of course, the natural limitations in reviewing transcripts of evidence without having the benefit of seeing the witnesses give their evidence). In that regard, I note that in SKA, the majority considered that ""[t]he account given and the language used by witnesses, which are available by way of transcript, are usually sufficient for a review of evidence"" ([31]). 

Appellant's evidence

188As a general observation, the appellant's evidence can be characterised as a mixture of blanket denials and an inability to recall events or conversations. While it is not surprising that the appellant could not remember the exact dates when people came and went, it is surprising that when it came to critical matters, such as what was said at the 2007 family meeting (at which he accepts there was discussion as to what was in the best interests of the children) and what was said at the consultation with Dr Rewais in 2003, he was unable to recall almost anything.

189For example, the appellant could not remember whether there was a discussion with his wife about the incident with Kay on the day Kay locked herself in the caravan but thought there probably was; he could not remember how long after the incident the decision was made to take Kay to see a psychiatrist; he thought he probably discussed it with his own psychiatrist, but could not remember what was discussed.

190As to Kay's consultations with Dr Rewais, the appellant admitted that on the first occasion he attended and went in with Kay, but could not remember any detail of the conversation; could not remember anything about the visits. He could not remember when there was ""mention"" that Dr Rewais was going to make a notification to DOCS but said that there was mention of that and that he was not happy and that was not the reason that they had taken Kay along to that particular psychiatrist.

191It beggars belief that such events would not have left an imprint on his memory, since they followed from disclosure of conduct that in Lisa's case involved him touching her naked breast and in Kay's case involved a formal notification to DOCS of conduct that involved, on his own admission, reaching under Kay's clothes and touching (though he says inadvertently) her breast.

192Similarly, the appellant could not recall anything said at the time in 2007 that he went to Mary's house to pick up Kay and Lisa after they had run away to Mary's house, just that ""there was words going backwards and forwards"". He said that the girls had decided to stay at Mary's for 3 or 4 days. He could not remember the discussion at the subsequent family meeting, but remembered being there. When asked the topics discussed, he said:

I think locks on doors was discussed. I don't know whether that was of any great import. We certainly didn't carry through with that. I'm just trying to remember. There was lots of toings and froings about how the family would be affected in one way or another but I honestly can't remember
...

Well, we were trying to work out what was in the best interests of the children.

193The appellant's explanation for his inability to recall events or conversations was put variously as being that there had been many dramas in his time as a foster father (and hence the events in question were just another day in the life of this foster family) and that he suffered from depression and that had caused memory lapses.

194Second, the appellant's evidence is remarkable for the fact that he could give no explanation for his admitted conduct against Lisa, though denying that he had a sexual interest in young girls. He did not suggest, as his wife maintained, that the incident she witnessed was one of inadvertent touching or of covering up an exposed breast. The admission that he had placed his mouth on Lisa's breast (even once, though in the agreed facts he admitted doing it twice) defies explanation as anything other than a sexual act and one that the appellant must have known was highly inappropriate and serious misconduct.

195Third, the appellant's responses in cross-examination reveal a tendency to become confrontational with the cross-examiner, which may have been a result of stress or frustration with the cross-examination. So, for example, the appellant said that he was telling the truth ""and you don't like to hear it""; on one occasion he informed the trial judge that he was ""having difficulty with how much never ever this lady [the trial advocate] understands""; and said that the questions ""are getting so far weird, to be quite honest"".

196The appellant took issue in cross-examination when answers that he had given in chief were put to him again, for example, as to his statement that Jane had wanted desperately to be adopted (""by hook or by crook""). In cross-examination, he said he did not know how desperate she was and then when his earlier answer was put to him said ""Well, if that's what I said, yes"" and ""if you've got the transcript there, yes, probably true"".

197More significant, is the appellant's attempt to resile from the admitted facts of his conduct towards Lisa. The circumstances in which this occurred were that, as noted earlier, at the commencement of his cross-examination, the appellant denied a sexual interest in girls between 8 and 13 and that he was willing to act on that attraction; denied that he sexually and indecently assaulted young girls in his care and denied that he used his position of authority as a foster father to gain access to young girls for that purpose. A global denial to that effect was inconsistent with his admission as to the conduct committed against Lisa. It might be that the appellant could argue that he had not committed those acts because of a sexual interest in young girls in general (i.e., that he had only had such an interest in Lisa), but that is not what the appellant said.

198Insofar as the appellant was there denying a sexual interest or attraction to Lisa, that is not credible having regard to the nature of his admitted conduct towards Lisa. Not surprisingly, therefore, the appellant was immediately confronted with his admissions in relation to the conduct against Lisa. His response to those questions seriously diminished his credibility in my opinion. 

199The appellant said that he had admitted the indecent assault against Lisa to minimise the damage to his family so that they did not have to come to court. When asked why he had indecently assaulted Lisa, the appellant's response was that he did not know. When asked what he had done to her he said:

A. I touched her breasts, according to my statement of admissions (my emphasis)

200When asked what he meant by that answer, he gave the following evidence:

A. You drafted it. I signed it

and when the trial advocate pointed out that she had not drafted it, he said:

A. Well one of your fellow henchmen in the DPP drafted it

201That bespeaks little contrition or recognition on the part of the appellant as to the seriousness of the offences to which he had already pleaded guilty. More than once, when asked whether he admitted the facts set out in his signed document, the appellant said words to the effect that they were the facts he had admitted, or ""well, whatever it says"" or ""that's what it says here"". This can only fairly be read as an attempt by the appellant to distance himself from that conduct. That became apparent when the appellant was questioned as to the second time he had put his mouth on Lisa's breast:

Q. After some time you removed your mouth from that breast and then you again placed your mouth on her breast, didn't you?
A. That's what it says here.

Q. That's what you did, isn't it?
A. That's what I admitted on this statement but, no, it didn't happen; but I can't go beyond what's written here. If I've got to tell his Honour exactly what happened, that's what happened.

Q. What happened?
A. Nothing. The second time.

...

A. I did it once; not twice.

202The appellant conceded that he had signed the document and that the document said that he had twice put his mouth on Lisa's breast. Asked if that was what he had admitted to the magistrate, the appellant said he did not know ""without seeing the transcript"".

203The appellant said that he could not remember any incident when he went into Lisa's bedroom after he came home from a Lions Club meeting, lifted her body up and placed his hands under her clothing and onto her breasts (though this was precisely the conduct described in the third of the counts to which he had pleaded guilty) and said:

A. I know what it says. I'm not superhuman. How can I lift a person of 11 years of age up like it says? But I did sign the paper. Yes, I did.

The appellant said more than once that he had signed the document but that he could not remember the incident; and then said he did not do anything and did not do what the signed agreement said he had done.

204The appellant's attempt to resile from what he had agreed in the statement is relevant for a number of reasons. Apart from the glaring inconsistency with his admission that he had signed the document and that he had admitted to having done those things, his assertion that he could not recall an incident that he had previously (in such a serious context as the plea of guilty to the charges then before him) admitted suggests that caution should be exercised before placing reliance on other instances where he said at the trial that he was unable to recall things. 
205The suggestion that it was physically impossible for him to have done what he had earlier admitted doing to Lisa, is echoed in his assertion at the trial that it was physically impossible for him to have done what Jane said he had done (fondling his penis while kneeling or standing against her bed) and casts doubt on how much weight can be placed on that assertion. Similarly, the evidence given by him as to the particular penile condition from which he suffered over the period (and which he appeared to rely upon in support of his denial that he had been fondling his penis or pleasuring himself while engaged in the conduct towards Jane - i.e., his evidence that he tried not to have an erection because it was very painful might be seen as another attempt to suggest physical impossibility as a way of denying the offences).

206His evidence (supported by his wife) that he was having sexual relations with his wife during the time of the events in question and his evidence that he was capable of becoming aroused and achieving an erection in that time sits at odds with the suggestion that it was unlikely for him to have fondled himself while engaging in the conduct of which Jane complained. (The evidence of continuing sexual relations with his wife is also inconsistent with Paul's evidence that during the family meeting, the appellant's wife said that they could not blame the appellant as he had not had sexual relations for some time.)

207There was also evidence to suggest that at least in 2009, the appellant had attempted to blame Lisa for his conduct. The appellant at trial said that the person who had prepared the report before he was dealt with by the magistrate (for sentencing on the Lisa offences) had ""grabbed the wrong end of the stick"" and that he had been ""flabbergasted"" when whatever it was had suddenly ""came out as fact"", though there was no suggestion that he had corrected this at the time. He also admitted that he had told the person preparing the pre-sentencing report that Lisa had done something that had influenced his behaviour at the time of the offence but refused to say what that was because he said that he had been misrepresented and had ""got caned for it"" and that it was unfair to Lisa. He denied that he had been trying to cast blame on Lisa and said:

I was asked to be honest. I could have said lots of other things and, in retrospect, maybe I should have. Being honest doesn't get you anywhere, in this Court or any other.

208The appellant remembered that Kay had locked herself in the caravan; could not remember trying to get into the caravan; remembered speaking to her; did not think that he had asked if she had called his wife; then said he could not recall what had happened that day; denied that it was a day that led to him seeing a psychiatrist; did not recall having said anything about it to Dr Rewais. His recollection of the incident was vague as to what Kay was wearing or anything further than that she was lying in her bed to one side. He could not remember exactly what he said to his wife; he said that day was ""one more day in the life - if you've ever been a foster-father - and that's unlikely [presumably because the trial advocate was female] ... you have many traumas over many days, you can't recall them all. I do not recall what went on that day in full"".

209He agreed that he would have discussed the incident with his wife at the time. He could not recall what had been said to him by his wife. He had a vague recollection of going to see Dr Rewais but could not remember what the conversation was or much about the visit and did not recall being angry or the conversation as to Dr Rewais having to notify DOCS. He suggested that his memory had gone because he suffered from depression. He did not recall his wife being angry ""but I guess she would have been"".

210The appellant said that Kay needed counselling because ""she was upset and she wasn't doing what she should have been doing"". He had a vague recollection that Dr Rewais said that Kay should receive further counselling but agreed that he had not organised for any further counselling.

211The appellant said it was his wife who said she was going to speak to Ms McKenzie but that he did not attend the meeting with DOCS. He said that he was not particularly interested to know what had gone on there and that it had never entered his mind that DOCS would investigate and report his conduct or that there would be a police investigation.

212As to the incident when his wife witnessed him with Lisa, the appellant said his recollection was pretty hazy; he agreed that his wife was ""not happy""; he could not recall if there was an argument or words passing between he and his wife on the day; he said that Lisa was not crying; and kept saying that he did not recall what had happened on the day. He accepted it was ""a significant day"" but said it was one of ""many, many, many, that we've had in our family"". He could not recall if he had given his wife any reasons as to why he indecently assaulted Lisa.

213As to the meeting with Kay and Lisa where Kay said that she said what about what you've taken from us, he could not recall her saying that although he recalled her shouting something as he went out the door. He could not recall being exceptionally concerned. He referred to ""the saga of looking after these four difficult children"".

214As to the family meeting, again he had little recollection of the conversations but said that it was to work out what was in the best interests of the children. He did not remember much of the conversations; he recalled that the children wanted locks on their doors. He remembered being ""sorry that it had come to a meeting where everybody was involved"" but apart from that he could not remember.

215The appellant agreed that there was a discussion with his wife about putting structures or process in place, and that:

I recall there was discussions about how we could continue with the children being happy to live there, yes, as far as I understand, but what particular structures or what particular things, I can't recall

216Taken to what his wife had written in the letter she prepared for DOCS:

Because we realised that the children would be removed from our care and that no good for the children could ever come out of reporting the matter, we as a family decided that we could manage the behaviour ourselves by putting a lot of structures in place to ensure that nothing of this nature could ever happen again

the appellant said that he would call them ""protocols"" but he did not recall discussions with his wife about not reporting the matter to the authorities ""in particular detail"", just that ""the authorities"" was one of the things mentioned at the family meeting ""and the ramifications on the children"".

217In his letter to DOCS, the appellant agreed that he had referred to the family meeting and had said that:

It was decided that the interests of [Lisa and her sister], and our other children who were minors at the time, would be best protected by not making a disclosure to the police or DOCS at that time, as we knew all the children would be removed from the family.

...

Her [the appellant's wife's] only motive was to ensure and preserve the ongoing family structure and security for our family and the children in it, and put structures in place to ensure the safety of the children [by which the appellant said he meant ""So that they could feel safe in our house""]

218The appellant said that the whole family at the family meeting had decided this but that he did not remember taking part in the conversations. The letter was written at the time of the disclosure by Lisa to the police. The appellant said that he could not remember all of the ""protocols"" but that one was not to go into the children's rooms and the other was for his wife to know where he was at all times.

219The appellant accepted that there was concern that the children would be removed from his and his wife's care if DOCS was involved but could not recall whether his wife had talked to him about it.
220The appellant said that a document had been prepared (he believed by Mary and Lisa or Lisa and Kay) that was a contract agreed upon between he, his wife and the girls that included things about him not going into their rooms and things about the girls' behaviour but he could not recall details of any other things.

221The conclusion that it was reasonably open to the jury to draw (and that I would draw from a review of the appellant's evidence as a whole), is that the appellant was having difficulty recognising, or acknowledging, the seriousness of his behaviour against Lisa; that he was not prepared to accept responsibility for his actions against her; and that this cast doubt on the credibility of the denials/inability to recall matters relevant to whether the earlier offences had been committed. I deal later with the particular aspects of his evidence on the topics on which the appellant asserts that Jane and/or Kay's evidence was unreliable. 

Evidence of the appellant's wife

222As a general comment on the evidence of the appellant's wife, she maintained adamantly that her husband had committed no offences; she appeared consistently to have made excuses for him and to have minimised or failed to appreciate the seriousness of conduct witnessed by her and to which he had admitted; and there were numerous matters as to which she professed to have no recollection. The appellant's wife said on at least two occasions that she had no idea about dates or that dates did not mean anything to her.

223It was open to the jury to infer (and on the evidence I would infer) that the appellant's wife was attempting to protect her husband from the consequences of his actions. Clearly, this was the view reached by the trial judge.

224For example, the appellant's wife supported his evidence that she had always waited up for him and was awake when he returned from Lions Club meetings and that this was the case every fortnight for 21 years. However, when pressed, the appellant's wife said that she would not guarantee that there were not occasions when she might have fallen asleep in her bed waiting for her husband to come home but that ""when I heard him come in that front door I would have been awake"".

225The appellant's wife, denying Jane's account of the disclosure, said that she had an ""average temper"" and that she could be ""verbally angry; verbally outspoken"" but did not think she had a particularly high anger problem. She said that she did not recall ever being angry with Jane (but did recall being angry with Lisa).

226More significant in my opinion is the inconsistency between the version of events given by the appellant's wife in relation to the consultation with Dr Rewais and that of the psychiatrist himself (who had the benefit of contemporaneous notes).

227The appellant's wife said that she had not made the arrangements for Kay to see Dr Rewais and that she only attended with her once. She denied having misled the Court at the pre-trial hearing as to the identity or location of the psychiatrist and said that she did not recall how the appointment was made. She did not recall her husband actually being in the meeting on 30 July with Dr Rewais. She insisted that she did not recall the conversation and did not recall Kay being upset and crying or that she was concerned. She did not recall that Dr Rewais had said at the first meeting that he would have to notify DOCS.

228She did not deny being upset at the suggestion that DOCS should be introduced into any procedure but said that was because she felt it did not warrant what was suggested. She did not recall that Dr Rewais had strongly suggested more counselling, then said that she believed that Kay had counselling at school but was unable to give any details about this and it is clear that this was no more than an assumption. She denied that she had taken Kay to see Dr Rewais because she thought she needed counselling but said that she had ""issues that needed to be dealt with"" (namely her husband taking the cat away and touching Kay's breasts).

229In my opinion, the most significant evidence demonstrating the attitude of the appellant's wife was her attempt to downplay the incident when she walked into Lisa's room and saw her husband with his hand on her breast. Her account as to this was that:

... he was waking [Lisa] and he - I walked in on him and he had put his hand on her breast
...
[Lisa] was going to a sports venue that day and I had said to my husband, ""Will you go and wake her."" It was in the morning and she needed to get up ... I was still in bed and he was ready for work and he went - left my bedroom and went to wake her up. I remembered something I needed to tell him on that day and I got up and followed him into that bedroom and I saw him open the Venetian blinds and he walked to her bed. He sat bedside her on the bed. She was asleep. She was laying face down looking at the window - facing towards the window with her arms above her head under her pillow and her left breast was exposed and he sat bedside her on the bed to wake her, put his hands on her back, put his hands on either side of her back and proceeded to put his left hand under her left breast and I said, ""What is going on here?"" [Lisa] turned over and said to me, ""Hi mum,"" and I said, ""What's going on,"" and she said, ""He touched my breast...
...
I considered it to be inappropriate. I considered it to be - what I witnessed and what I saw was an incident of - her left breast was showing underneath his - underneath her arm and he appeared to me to be covering that breast but I didn't consider it to be a particular sexual assault in as much as [Lisa] showed no particular indication of distress or the fact that it didn't seem to be an actual sexual incident. It seemed to be an incident where he covered her breast and he pushed her breast back underneath her when she was asleep. (my emphasis)
...
I didn't believe it to have any sexual connotations. I believed it to be somebody who was covering something that shouldn't have been exposed

230The appellant's wife accepted that her husband had admitted his guilt in relation to Lisa but cryptically insisted that she knew a bit more about the circumstances and did not believe he had ever committed those offences. She also said she had not discussed with her husband in specific detail the offences that he had admitted.
231At the trial, it was put to the appellant's wife (and she denied) that she regarded what her husband had done to Lisa as being done out of love or that he was only trying to comfort her or that there was any ""particular emotional situation attributed to that"". She said that she believed it was a ""spontaneous act"". That was inconsistent with her handwritten letter to DOCS (to which she was then taken) in September 2009 in which she had written words to the effect that it ""was done out of love, not hate. He was trying to comfort her"". At first, the appellant's wife said that this was taken out of context and then sought to explain it, as a very general statement but she ultimately accepted that she had made the comments. She also said she believed her husband was under extreme stress at the time whereas in the letter to DOCS she accepted she had written that ""I realised that [the appellant] was in fact sick"" (at the trial she said that by that she meant he was suffering stress).

232The appellant's wife was adamant that she did not believe that there was any incident with Jane; did not believe that the incident with Kay was as Kay described; and did not believe the incident with Lisa was a sexually motivated incident.

233The appellant's wife did not recall the specifics of the discussion at the family meeting, though she said that she did not recall being the one who spoke much at all. She ""categorically"" denied that she had said words to the effect that her husband could not be blamed, as they had not had sexual relations for a long time but then accepted that there might have been something mentioned about her sexual relations with her husband, but said she had no recollection of what was said except that it was not that. She denied that she had said the girls had flirted with him; or that she had said that he would go to gaol for a long time or that she would kill herself. Paul's evidence was to the contrary on those matters. Paul gave evidence that the appellant's wife was making excuses and was defensive; that she said that they had not had a sexual relationship for a long time; that the girls had led him on; that she would probably kill herself if it came out; that he would be locked away; and that it was going to tear the family apart. An expression of the last concern is consistent with what Dr Rewais recalled the appellant's wife as having said and with the text of the letters to DOCS explaining why no disclosure had been made at that stage. It is also consistent with Kay's evidence that the appellant's wife had told her that the other children were too old to be placed elsewhere (by way of discouraging disclosure by her).

234The appellant's wife remembered a discussion about a number of different options, such as separating and dividing the house but she said that the suggestion that there be locks on the doors was tongue in cheek.

235The appellant's wife recalled that her husband had apologised for what he had done to the girls and said that it was an apology to both Kay and Lisa but in Kay's case she did not accept that this was an apology of anything other than the inadvertent touching on the appellant's version of events.

236In summary, both the appellant and his wife professed a singular lack of recollection of events that must have had a significant impact on them at the time. That must have cast serious doubt on their credibility. 

Verdicts on counts 1-6 (involving conduct against Jane)

237The appellant submits that a review of Jane's evidence shows that it was unreliable and that she lied.

238In particular, it is submitted that the unreliability of Jane's memory is demonstrated by: the assertion (said by the appellant not to accord with common experience) by Jane that her memory had been repressed and that she had recovered some memories in the period since her initial police statement in 2010 (such as the swimming incident); her comment to Mary in 2009 that she had thought that she might be dreaming; and Jane's reliance, when giving evidence at the trial, on her earlier statements to support her memory. 

239As to the doubt cast on the reliability of Jane's memory, the explanation given by Jane for the fact that further matters were raised by her after she gave her initial police statement is one that on its face is not so implausible as to have been incapable of acceptance by the jury. 

240Similarly, little weight can be placed on Jane's comment to Mary in 2009 that she had thought she might be dreaming, since that could be understood as indicating that she had had certain recollections that she had dismissed on the basis that she must have been dreaming but now appreciated were actual memories. It does not suggest that Jane's memory was so unreliable that her evidence could not support the findings made by the jury.

241As to the reliance by Jane, when giving evidence, on what she had said in her earlier statements to support her memory, a review of the transcript of Jane's evidence (bearing in mind the recognised limitations on any review of the record of the trial), reveals that Jane expressed considerable confusion throughout her cross-examination as to what she was being asked and she did give inconsistent answers on points of detail, particularly when pressed as to matters where it was put to her that her earlier statements were inconsistent with agreed facts (such as the date at which she had been placed in the appellant's foster care) or where she was challenged as to the completeness of evidence given by her or inconsistency between her evidence in chief and her evidence in cross-examination (such as the cross-examination in which it was pointed out that she had said, after giving evidence of the third incident, that that was all she recalled and it was put to her that she had previously given evidence as to two other incidents - the fourth and fifth incidents).

242The impression I gained from reading the transcript of her evidence at the trial was that her responses in cross-examination were at times defensive and emotional. However, this is again a matter where there is a natural limitation when reviewing the transcript, since the jury had the advantage of seeing her give evidence and hence forming an assessment as to whether that was due to her nervousness or stress or was an indication that she was dishonest or unreliable in the giving of her evidence.

243With those general observations in mind, I turn to the particular aspects of the evidence that the appellant relies upon as demonstrating that the verdicts were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.

Counts 1-3

Age at which offences occurred

244An essential element of the first three counts was the age at which the offences occurred (i.e., under 10).

245At the trial, Jane was cross-examined on the inconsistency between her first statement to police (in which she said that at least two years had passed between commencing living with the appellant's family and the first incident of sexual abuse comprising count 1) and the allegation that she was 9 years' old when the offence occurred, since it was an agreed fact that Jane was 8¾ years' old when she commenced living with the appellant and his wife. In that first statement, Jane had said that she was 7 years' old when she commenced living with the appellant and his wife. 

246The appellant submits that, taking into account Jane's evidence that the tickle fights preceded the sexual abuse, and her evidence as to when the tickle fights commenced, Jane cannot have been 9 years' old (but must have been 11¾ years' old) at the time she said that the conduct the subject of counts 1-3 occurred. 

247The appellant points to Jane's agreement that she could not recall how old she was at the time when the abuse commenced without checking her police statement and that she could not be sure how old she was when she was in bedroom 2, where the conduct alleged in counts 1-5 occurred.

248Jane's evidence was that she moved into bedroom 2 some time after she arrived at the appellant's house. The appellant and his wife each gave evidence that this was some time around 3, 4 or 5 months after she arrived in the household (the appellant said that Jane was in bedroom 4 for ""3 or 4 maybe 5 months"" after she arrived and then was in bedroom 2). Bedroom 2 was next to that of the appellant and his wife. There was some difference as between Jane and the appellant/appellant's wife as to whether there were two pink bunk beds or a single bed there when Jane first moved into that bedroom. 

249Having regard to the agreed fact as to her age when she arrived at the house, Jane must have been around 9 years' old when she first occupied bedroom 2. That means that there was a period of at least 8 months and perhaps as long as 11 months when, on Jane's account of the occurrence of the incidents, she was under 10 years' old.

250Jane's evidence at the hearing, when first asked, was that she could not recall ""this moment"" how old she was when the tickle fights began; she said that she was ""roughly nine"" when something happened to her in bedroom 2 but was not 100% sure of her age for that bedroom"". On cross-examination, she said that she was about 9 years' old when they were playing the tickle fight game and that it continued for a period of time but she could not give an answer as to how long. She said that it had been ""months at least"" after her arrival at the appellant's house that the game had started; and she was not positive as to whether the tickle fights had ended before the appellant started coming into her room.

251Jane was then taken to what she had said in her initial police statement, namely that she had gone into the appellant and his wife's care when she was 7 in 1987 and that the appellant did not interfere with her with respect to count 1 until she was 9 years' old. The age there given for her placement in the household was accepted as being incorrect. 

252It was put to her that what she had indicated in her statement was that it was at least two years between the time that she went to live with the appellant and the commencement of the abuse. If her evidence as to her age when the charged abuse started is measured from the erroneous belief that she was 7 when she came to the appellant's house, and it started two years after the foster care commenced then it follows logically that Jane would have been somewhere around 10¾ when the incident the subject of count 1 began. Jane said at the trial that she did not believe it was as long as two years that had passed before the first count and said that it was a maximum of a year between going to live with the appellant and his wife and the first occasion of abuse.

253Jane accepted that in her initial police statement there was no mention about the tickle fights and that she had told the police about those in her statement in September 2011. In that statement, she said that the tickle fights began between the ages of 8 and 9. At trial, she said that they began within a year of being placed there. A series of questions was then put to her based on different assumptions as to what age she was and when the tickle fights had begun. With no disrespect to Counsel conducting the cross-examination, it is understandable that the witness was confused in circumstances where some of the questioning was as to whether she had given particular answers the previous day and the questions moved from answers that were as to conduct occurring ""within a year"" or at a maximum of one year after arrival at the house and conduct at ""about"" or ""roughly"" nine to conduct ""after"" nine. 

254What appears to be suggested was that on the chronology that the tickle fights started about a year after she had arrived and the first count was after that then the first count could not have occurred when she was under 10. However, as the trial judge noted, Jane's evidence started with the statement that she was ""about"" 9 when the tickle fights were being played; it was put to her that they started ""when [she] was nine, at least nine"" (which was not what she had said; though she agreed with that proposition). It was later put to her that she had said the tickle fights started about a year later but she had said they started ""within a year"", which is not the same proposition.

255Jane appears to have been clearly confused as to whether she was being asked to admit to what she had said earlier in her evidence or as to what had occurred:

Didn't you just say you suggested that to me? You're confusing - you're completely confusing me. You're not going to be able to get out of me, because I'm not sure what you're asking me.

256The line of questioning continued and led to what seems to have been complete confusion on Jane's part as to what she was being asked and what she was told she had agreed to or accepted earlier in the evidence.

257Jane's evidence was that the conduct occurred when her night light was still on (the night light being while she was 9-10 or 11, Jane saying that it had ceased at 11). The appellant and his wife gave evidence that she was being trained not to have a night light on over an 18 month period between the ages of 9 and 11.

258The appellant did not recall ever being involved in tickle fights with Jane. He said:

Not that I can recall, no. I'd say never in tickle fights. I used to - we used - certainly not in the first 18 months. She was too tender, if you like, for that. She was too agitated. We were not hands off, but very careful, very wary about her actions at that stage so no I wouldn't have tickled her. I have tickled kids on occasions but inappropriately, no.

259He said in his examination in chief that he did not think he would ever have gone into Jane's bedroom in the first 18 months or 2 years that Jane was with the family because he said Jane was ""too jumpy for [him] to do much"". On cross-examination, when it was put to him that his wife had said there may have been occasions when her husband checked on Jane during the night, although it was usually she who did so, the appellant said ""I've never said I wasn't ever in [Jane's room]. I just cannot remember doing it, and I would have no reason to be in her room"".

260What the appellant there emphasised was that he had not engaged in tickle fights with Jane in the first 18 months to 2 years (""certainly not in the first 18 months""). It reads on paper as leaving open the possibility that he had engaged in tickle fights with Jane but at a later time than she had recalled. Again, in cross-examination what he said was that he could not remember having played tickle fights with her.

261There is a contrast between the appellant's inability to recall tickle fights with Jane and his adamant denial of: touching or dealing with her in a sexual way, the allegations the subject of the charged counts, ever having taken Jane surf skiing with him (the conduct the subject of count 6) and his description in cross-examination of certain of Jane's allegations as ""hallucinatory"".

262In all, the question whether the tickle fights took place and at what age depended on whose version of events (that of Jane and that of the appellant) was to be preferred. In circumstances where the appellant's evidence was somewhat equivocal on the topic (as compared to other of his evidence) and there was a common theme across the complainants' evidence of ""tickling"", it cannot be said that there was not evidence reasonably open to the jury to conclude that Jane should be believed on this aspect of the matter. 

263As to the age at which the tickle fights, and the subsequent offences, took place, the appellant's submission was that Jane had no independent recollection (given the inconsistencies in her evidence on that point and the fact that she had sought to have regard to her statements to assist her recollection).

264There is no doubt, from a review of the transcript, that Jane was confused in the course of cross-examination on this aspect of the matter. Where she was consistent was that the abuse the subject of count 1 had occurred when she was about or roughly 9. The process of recollection by which she arrived at that age was not made clear - it was tested in cross-examination by reference to the time that had elapsed between her arrival and the start of the tickle fights; the duration of those fights; and whether there was an overlap between the tickle fights and the abuse. It was a matter for the jury to assess the credibility of Jane's evidence on that point and the reliability of her recollection, having regard to the matters to which their attention was drawn by Counsel for the appellant and having regard to their assessment of the credibility of the appellant in his assertion (among other things) that he had not entered Jane's bedroom at all in the first 18 months of her stay in the house. 

265It was reasonably open to the jury, having regard to all of the evidence, to accept Jane's evidence (confused as she was in the course of cross-examination) that the tickle fights commenced within months of her arrival and that the abuse started no later than a year after her arrival when she was about 9. On that basis it was reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied of the age element essential to counts 1-3.

Conduct the subject of the alleged offences

266Apart from the inconsistency as to Jane's age at the time of the alleged offences, the appellant points to inconsistencies in relation to particular aspects of Jane's evidence in relation to each of counts 1-3.

267In relation to first count, the appellant points to the fact that Jane gave evidence in chief as to the appellant rubbing his penis against the bed as he was touching her but, when asked to describe the incident in cross-examination, made no mention of this and could not exactly describe the position of the appellant at the time. I have already referred to the confusion that attended the commencement of Jane's cross-examination. There seems to have been some apparent defensiveness on the part of Jane in her answers to later questions. Insofar as Jane did not refer to the fondling when asked to recall again, in cross-examination, the first incident, the Crown points out that Jane's 2010 police statement had also included reference to the appellant rubbing his penis against the bed.

268Little weight would in my view be attached to the fact that, under the stress of cross-examination, Jane did not refer to that aspect of the incident.

269In relation to the second count, the appellant similarly points to the fact that, in cross-examination, Jane did not refer to the appellant fondling himself during the encounter. It is also noted that Jane agreed that her initial police statement did not refer to the appellant touching her breasts, fondling himself during the incident, and panting or grunting. The appellant points to contradictory answers on this aspect and as to which of her police statement or her evidence in court was the more accurate.

270As I read the transcript, and bearing in mind the natural limitations of a review of evidence by reference to the transcript alone, Jane's evidence in cross-examination was characterised by confusion as to the questions asked of her and defensiveness on her part. The jury was able to weigh the inconsistencies to which the appellant points and it was reasonably open to the jury to conclude that not much weight should be drawn from this other than that Jane was an obviously stressed witness. That is the conclusion I would draw from the transcript. 

271In relation to the third count, the appellant points to inconsistent evidence as to whether the appellant was standing or kneeling while digitally penetrating her and fondling his penis. That might well be explicable by the fact that Jane was giving evidence as to what occurred when she was young and when her perception of the position of the appellant may have been influenced by his height relative to the bed.

272The appellant said that it was physically impossible for him to have done what Jane said he did. One might well think that little weight could be placed on that protestation since the appellant also maintained at one point in his cross-examination that it was impossible for him to have lifted and moved Lisa as he had earlier admitted he had done in respect of count 3 of the charges to which he pleaded guilty. Again, this is a matter on which it was reasonably open to the jury to accept Jane's account of events.

Counts 4 and 5

273The issue as to the age element of these alleged offences does not arise in relation to these counts since Jane's own evidence was that the appellant had ceased to abuse her by the time she reached puberty (at 14), although the appellant notes that there were inconsistencies between Jane's evidence and her police statement as to the age at which the incident giving rise to the fourth and fifth counts occurred that it is submitted indicated that she did not have any independent recollection of that incident.

274In relation to the fourth and fifth counts, the appellant places weight on the fact that, in cross-examination, after Jane was asked questions about the third alleged incident, and was then asked whether there were any other incidents, Jane did not make reference to the incident giving rise to the fourth and fifth counts but instead said that ""These things occurred ...previously to that, three or four times a week"". Jane then accepted the proposition put to her by the cross-examiner that the specific incidents that she had just described (i.e., the first three incidents) were the only specific ones that she could remember.

275The appellant submits that it can be concluded that Jane did not have any independent recollection of the incident giving rise to the fourth and fifth counts. The observations already made as to Jane's evidence are equally applicable here. It was reasonably open to the jury to conclude that the failure of Jane in cross-examination to recount the incident the subject of these counts was not indicative of unreliability of her evidence in chief in relation to that incident. That is the conclusion I would draw from my review of the course of the questioning and answers recorded in the transcript. Jane's recollection that the night-light was not on during this incident is consistent with the incident occurring at the age as charged.

Matters relating to each of counts 1-5 

276The appellant submits that the jury's failure to reach a verdict on the sixth count can be taken into account as something that adversely affects Jane's credit, noting that Jane's friend had given contradictory evidence to that of Jane and that Jane's evidence at trial as to this incident varied from the account she had given earlier. I have not referred in detail to the evidence given by Jane's friend (or Jane's friend's mother), as to the count 6 incident. I have reviewed that evidence and it does not change my opinion that it was reasonably open to the jury to find Jane a credible witness. I am not satisfied that the discharge of the jury on this count is something from which it can be inferred that Jane was not a credible witness in relation to the other counts. There were significant differences in the conduct the subject of this count and the others involving Jane (in particular, that it was said to have occurred on a swimming trip, rather than at night in her bedroom). Hence the conclusions drawn by the jury from the tendency evidence may not have had as much impact in relation to this count. 

277The appellant also challenged Jane's reliability as a witness by reference to alleged inconsistencies in her evidence as to the making of her disclosures of the appellant's conduct: first as to the alleged disclosure to the appellant's wife when she was about 12 years' old, then to the disclosure to Paul in about 2003; and finally, the disclosure in 2009 to Paul and Mary, including her explanation for the delay in making the disclosures. 

278First, the appellant submits that the explanation given by Jane for the delay in the making of her complaint was either wrong or fanciful (insofar as Jane had referred to rejection by other families and thought, or said she had been told by DOCS, that this was her last chance to have a family) and points to inconsistent evidence given by Jane as to the attitude of the appellant's wife. However, both the appellant and the appellant's wife gave evidence that Jane was ""desperate"" to be adopted. The perception by Jane as to the rejection by other families is not inconsistent with the matching process that the appellant and his wife confirmed was undertaken by the relevant placement organisation at the time Jane was in temporary foster care.

279Therefore, the fact that Jane's explanation for the delay in complaint was her desperation to be adopted does not raise doubt as to Jane's credibility. Nor does her evidence as to the attitude of the appellant's wife towards her do so, since there was consistency in the evidence of Kay and Lisa, as well as the evidence of what was said in the family meeting by the wife (which I refer to shortly) that supports a conclusion that the appellant's wife was not supportive of complaints about the conduct of her husband and may have had anger management problems and the appellant's wife in her evidence suggested that there were difficulties in managing the respective children.

280As to the initial disclosure to Paul, there was uncertainty (as between Paul and Jane) as to when this disclosure occurred, but the accounts given by Paul and Jane were broadly consistent. The appellant points to the difference between Jane's evidence that she said no more than that the appellant and his wife abused her in that house and Paul's evidence that she said she had been touched inappropriately by the appellant. That difference is not in my view material. On Jane's evidence at trial, there was abuse by the appellant's wife at the time of the disclosure. Moreover, reading the transcript of Paul's evidence on paper, it can be seen that Paul was uncomfortable in being given any unpleasant detail of the allegations and his summary recollection of the disclosure is consistent with that.

281The appellant also notes that Paul had conceded that the 2003 disclosure did not cause him any undue concern and that he was not concerned about leaving his children alone unsupervised with the appellant. However, Paul's explanation for this was that his daughter was young at the time (she was much younger than the age at which the alleged assaults had occurred) and that it was a complaint by one person. His evidence was that he became concerned once he heard the complaints of Kay and Lisa.

282The appellant points to inconsistencies in the versions given by Jane to the police and later in her evidence in court as to her alleged disclosure to the appellant's wife (namely, as to the age she was when the incident occurred; how it started and what happened; and what happened at the end of the incident). The appellant contrasts this with the emphatic denial of the incident by the appellant's wife. Again, it is difficult to place a great deal of weight on inconsistency in the actual circumstances of the disclosure, when Jane's evidence was broadly consistent as to what had happened.

283Insofar as the appellant places weight on the emphatic denials of his wife, this suffers from the lack of credibility the appellant's wife has when her evidence is reviewed as a whole. Her evidence was marked by an almost complete inability to recall conversations relating to the events in question, including many which must, on any view of the matter, have been deeply concerning (such as what followed her witnessing the incident with Lisa and the discussion at the family meeting in 2007). 

284The denial by the appellant's wife and her inability to recall matters recorded in Dr Rewais' contemporaneous notes (such as her angry reaction to the foreshadowed DOCS notification) and the alternative version she gave in relation to the foreshadowed DOCS notification was telling; as was her emphatic refusal to accept that the appellant had committed any of the offences against Lisa to which he had earlier pleaded guilty and which were agreed facts at the trial.

285Finally, as to the disclosure by Jane to Mary in 2009, the appellant points to inconsistency in Jane's evidence as to whether Jane had recalled the details of the abuse at that stage or whether the memories had not come back to her until after her first statement to the police. As adverted to earlier, Jane was cross-examined as to matters contained in her 2011 police statement that were not referred to in her earlier police statement - the description of the tickle fights and additional detail as to the second alleged incident (such as the reference to the appellant touching her breasts on that occasion, panting and grunting, and fondling his penis after he had placed his fingers in her vagina). Jane's explanation for the additional information was that memories had come back to her.

286The appellant points to Jane's evidence at trial that when she disclosed the abuse to Mary in 2009 she was ""clear"" about all of the incidents. It is submitted that this is in direct contradiction to her statement that memories had come back to her after the first (January 2010) police statement. However, the fact that additional details were included of the second incident in the later police statement is not inconsistent with Jane having had a memory of the incident in 2009 and later remembering further details of the incident. As to the later remembrance of the tickle fights, it is by no means clear that Jane's evidence about all of the incidents being clear in her mind at 2009 included these, since the tickle fights were not the subject of any charge.

287Reference is also made by the appellant to Mary's evidence to the effect that she had a clear recollection of Jane referring to the surf incident (the subject of the unproven count 6). It is submitted that if that was Jane's clearest memory in 2009 then it follows that she must have been even less clear at that point in time on the incidents that ultimately resulted in convictions. However, what Mary was referring to in the relevant passage of her cross-examination, was her recollection that Jane had said she had started to feel that the dreams she had been having were true. In that context, Mary said that Jane had not hesitated on the surf incident but that she had discussed that some of the other ones she had been repressing. None of that is inconsistent with Jane's evidence that they had not discussed in detail the alleged abuse on that occasion. Mary's evidence was that her own memory of that discussion was mainly as to why Jane had not confided in her before. Little can be drawn from this as to the reliability of Jane's memory of those incidents that she did not discuss in detail with Mary in 2009. 

288Having considered the criticisms made of Jane's evidence as to her age when she was placed in the home and the age at which offences were committed (going to counts 1-3) and the additional matters relied upon for the appellant's submission that Jane's evidence was inherently unreliable and that she lied in her evidence, I am nevertheless of the view that it was reasonably open to the jury to accept that Jane's evidence was credible. The confusion apparent from the transcript on the part of Jane when giving her evidence and the matters to which the appellant has referred do not lead me to conclude that there was no reliable evidence to support a verdict of guilty beyond reasonable doubt as to counts 1-5 in relation to the conduct alleged towards Jane. In my opinion, Jane's confusion was understandable given the line of questioning on issues such as the issue of age. The jury heard her evidence and heard the denials of the appellant on the counts in question. It was reasonably open for them to prefer Jane's evidence to that of the appellant having regard to all of the other evidence before them.

Verdict on count 7 - Kay

289The principal basis on which the appellant challenges the verdict on count 7 arises from Kay's evidence that the first two incidents occurred when she was occupying bedroom 2 and that both occurred either when the appellant's wife had been in hospital or shortly after. (Bedroom 5 was the scene of the last incident and had a different layout and furniture from bedroom 2.)

290The agreed facts included that the appellant's wife was treated in hospital on a number of occasions, the first being in October 2000. Kay occupied bedroom 2 from 1994 to 1997 and moved to bedroom 5 when Lisa arrived.

291The first incident (that Kay placed as being when the appellant's wife was in hospital) was said to have occurred in the appellant and his wife's bed. There is no inconsistency arising at this point from the different bedrooms occupied by Kay because it is clear on her version that the event happened in the appellant's bed. Therefore, all that might be inferred from the hospital records is the possibility that the incident occurred some 3 years earlier than Kay had recalled (which would place the incident at a time when Kay was younger and make the objective seriousness of the incident greater).

292Kay placed the second incident as occurring shortly after the first. In 2000, Kay did not occupy the bedroom where she said the second incident occurred. This is relied upon as suggesting contamination of the evidence, because bedroom 2 is where the incidents involving Lisa took place.

293Kay's evidence of the last incident (count 7) showed some continuing confusion as to the bedrooms occupied by her at different times - though she was adamant that the last incident was in a different bed. Therefore, it may be that what was revealed by this was no more than an unreliable memory as to the bedroom in which the second (and last) incidents occurred. The appellant submits by reference to the above that reliance on the first two incidents was unreliable. 

294As to the evidence relating to count 7, it is submitted that of the two competing versions of the incident, Kay's was improbable (both as to the setting for the alleged abuse - a morning when other children were in the house at the time and the door was ""probably open"" - and as to what is said to have been the ""sudden and inexplicable change in the emotional state"" of Kay during the incident - a reference to the ""joking manner"" that Kay said she made the statement ""I'll scream""). 

295It is submitted that the appellant's version (that he had chastised her for having a cat in her room; that she put the cat down her pyjama top, he reached for the cat and accidentally touched her breasts; and that she reacted angrily to the intrusion of her privacy and the discipline of the appellant) was the more probable. The appellant recalled that Kay was very upset and had said he had touched her breasts; he remembered that she went to the caravan and said that he was outside working on the car.

296As to the incident with Kay, the appellant's wife agreed that Kay had telephoned her at work and that she was angry; she said that it was she, not Kay that had suggested she come home and gave details of what she said and of what she was doing at that time (preparing a meal for 24 children). She said that in the life of the family this was not a particularly big day and that they had had many dramas over kittens and animals being in the bedroom. She also said that there had been a conversation about the incident in the lounge room but she did not recall the exact conversation (other than it being about whether the appellant had a right to put his hand under her shirt to take the kitten out).

297As to which of the versions of the incident is inherently more probable, the difficulty for the appellant in arguing that the timing or setting for Kay's account is improbable is that the appellant had engaged in similar (though not identical) conduct towards a child in her bed in the morning while others were in the house when he committed the last of the counts charged against Lisa, to which he pleaded guilty. As to Kay's description of the comment being made ""in a joking manner"", that could well have been in an attempt to deflect or discourage the appellant without causing a scene. Kay's account of the earlier incidents, in saying that she needed to go to the bathroom, is consistent with such behaviour (and, indeed, Kay went to the bathroom on that occasion). Kay's explanation for making the disclosure to the appellant's wife at that stage (that she had learnt in sex education classes that this behaviour was wrong) has the ring of truth. 

298Moreover, an incident of the inadvertent kind that the appellant and his wife described (as being a hostile reaction by Kay to a disciplinary incident) seems unlikely, as a matter of commonsense, to have provoked such distress that it would cause the appellant's wife to arrange for Kay to see a counsellor some months later or, indeed, the high level of distress that Dr Rewais observed during that consultation or the pressure he considered she was under to minimise the incident.

299It is submitted that the only consistent assertion in the evidence was that there was an incident with a cat and an inadvertent touching of the breasts of Kay at the time. The appellant points to the evidence of what Kay had told Dr Rewais and submits that there is no explanation available other than that what Kay told the psychiatrist (as recalled by the psychiatrist) was the truth. It is noted that this was consistent with the appellant's version. However, Dr Rewais was of the opinion that Kay was under great pressure to minimise the incident and was very distressed, which is not consistent with the explanation given by the appellant and his wife about the incident. 

300As to the complaint to DOCS, the appellant submits that the version of Kay is unreliable and false, since it is not credible to suggest that a disclosure of a parent deliberately touching a 12 year old's breasts would not invite more investigation from DOCS. Ms McKenzie said that Kay had made it sound like it was an accidental thing and was quite embarrassed; that she did not want to take the matter any further and that her supervisor had said ""from what [Kay] had told me that we really didn't have grounds to take it any further"". Given the direction Ms McKenzie says she received from her superior, nothing adverse to the probability of Kay's being the correct version of events can be drawn from the fact that DOCS took no action. 

301Ms McKenzie could not recall mention of a cat but recalled that there was mention that the appellant ""had touched her boobs and was surprised that she was developing"". At least to the extent that there was no reference to a cat, that is inconsistent with the account given by the appellant and his wife (and, for that matter, Kay) to Dr Rewais. Ms McKenzie also recalled that the appellant's wife had dominated the conversation, lending credence to Kay's evidence that it was the appellant's wife who had told her what to say. This is consistent with Dr Rewais' observation that Kay was under pressure to minimise the incident and was afraid that the appellant would get into trouble over it.

302The appellant also points to the different versions of the evidence given by Kay as to what she told the appellant's wife on the day that count 7 occurred: at the voir dire hearing before Finnane DCJ (""Dad had touched me, nothing other than that""; at the trial (her acceptance of the proposition put to her by Counsel that she had told the appellant's wife that he had stuck his hand down her pants and rubbed her vagina and it was not the first time he had done it).

303Kay accepted in cross-examination that her memory had improved since she gave her earlier evidence in the voir dire hearing (when cross-examined as to the differences in her evidence as to the content of her disclosure to the appellant's wife). She attributed this to the earlier hearing having been the first time she had ""ever started to remember anything"" and having had some time since then to think about it. Whether or not Kay told her that the appellant touched her on the vagina or simply that he touched her inappropriately, it is clear that there was a disclosure of touching at the relevant time.

Contamination/concoction

304In relation to both grounds 7 and 8, reliance is again placed on the risk of contamination or concoction of the evidence based on the evidence of actual exchanges of information that it is said demonstrate a real risk of concoction or contamination and the familial relationship between Kay and Lisa who lived in the same house during the relevant period and for about two years thereafter. It is submitted that the appellant was in the difficult position of being unable to test conversations that had actually occurred or to respond to complaint evidence which may have been corrupted by a relationship or dealings between complainants before the trial.

305It is submitted that there must have been some awareness, around the middle of 2003, that something had happened because of the disruption in the household following the incident involving Kay and therefore there must have been a very real risk that exchanges of information about the appellant and his conduct could have occurred as early as the middle of 2003. Both Kay and Lisa, however, denied the exchange of details of the offences (and this argument does not in any event suggest any risk of contamination of Jane's evidence).

Conclusion as to unreasonable verdict grounds

306Having the above in mind, I have reviewed carefully the transcript both of the voir dire hearing (to which reference was made, together with reference to various of the witnesses' earlier police statements in the course of cross-examination at the trial) and of the trial itself. Obviously, the jury had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses (SKA at [13]), an advantage of particular relevance having regard to the emphasis the appellant places on inconsistencies in the evidence of Jane and Kay and the manner in which they explained or addressed those inconsistencies in cross-examination.

307Jane and Kay's evidence was not, of course, the whole of the evidence before the jury. In particular, the jury had the benefit of the evidence of Mary and Paul (as to the disclosures made by each of Jane and Kay) and of the appellant and his wife.

308Evidence of the family meeting in 2007 and of the consultation with Dr Rewais in 2003, for example, is significant in that it shed light on the family circumstances and the manner in which the appellant and his wife responded to the issues that were undoubtedly raised as a result of the incident involving Lisa that the appellant's wife witnessed and the incident that formed the subject of count 7.

309The account given by the appellant's wife of the consultations with the psychiatrist and her reaction to the foreshadowed notification of DOCS was contradicted by him, an objective observer with the benefit of contemporaneous file notes. The reaction of the appellant's wife to the foreshadowed notification to DOCS and at the family meeting is consistent with the reaction that the complainants say they received from the appellant's wife when they disclosed the appellant's conduct to her and with Paul's description of her response at the family meeting.

310The letters written by the appellant and by his wife to DOCS in 2009 are not consistent with their apparent inability to recall critical matters in the witness box and suggest an ongoing attempt by them in their evidence to minimise the concerns that had arisen at the time of Lisa's disclosure. Even if the family meeting, and the apologies made by the appellant at that meeting, related only to conduct that had occurred in relation to Lisa, the attempt to downplay the seriousness of what had occurred does not reflect well on their credibility. 

311The dismissal by the appellant's wife of the suggestion that locks be put on the doors, and the appellant's insistence that there was discussion of ""procedures"" but inability to recall anything about those is not plausible.

312The complaints by Jane to Paul were made at a time before she was aware of any complaints by Kay and Lisa. The evidence of the 2007 family meeting is consistent with Kay and Lisa's account and not that of the appellant and his wife. 

313The evidence of the appellant and his wife, and in particular his attempt to resile from admissions as to his conduct with Lisa and his wife's refusal to acknowledge any sexual connotation to that conduct, did not reflect well on their credit or reliability as witnesses.
314Having reviewed the transcript I am not of the opinion that it was not open to the jury to reach the verdicts the jury did on counts 1-5 and count 7. Grounds 7 and 8 are not made out.

Disposition of the present proceedings

315For the reasons set out above I would dismiss the appeal. 

316HARRISON J: I agree with Ward JA.

317R A HULME J: I agree with Ward JA.

2763888,R v Jones [2014] NSWSC 695,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Objection has been taken to paragraph 26 of Crown voir dire exhibit A; namely, the statement of Leanne Margaret Cavers of 17 January 2013. Suffice it to say that that paragraph contains the proposed evidence of Ms Cavers, the sister of the deceased, with regard to a telephone call that she made between 10 and 12 December 2012. 

2It is said by the witness that she heard a male ""yelling and screaming"", and then heard the deceased say ""Go away, leave me alone."" It is also said that the deceased sounded ""scared and worried"". 

3Defence counsel has submitted that the evidence should be rejected, either on the basis that it does not pass the test of relevance contained in s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (""the Act""); or, in the alternative, that it should be excluded pursuant to s 137 of the same Act. 

4Although defence counsel originally notified that there could be an objection with regard to s 59 - the hearsay rule; s 65 - hearsay statements in criminal proceedings if maker not available; and s 67- notice to be given with regard to such evidence, on reflection that objection was not pressed by defence counsel, and accordingly I put it to one side.

5Mr Watson submitted that there are a number of aspects that would lead me to exclude the evidence on one or other basis. The first was a lack of clarity as to dates. The second was the proposition that the jury may wrongly, and unfairly prejudicially, jump to the conclusion that the male who was ""yelling and screaming"" was indeed the accused. The third was that the evidence is uncorroborated by phone records and the like. And the fourth was that in the circumstances he is simply unable to test the evidence, in the sense of exploring what was actually occurring at the other end of the telephone line. 

6In other words, as I understand his submission, the proposition is that, whilst he may cross-examine Ms Cavers of course, he is not in a position to elucidate evidence as to what was actually occurring at the other end of that phone call. 

7It seems to me in the circumstances of this case, in light of the evidence already admitted and the openings, that the evidence certainly passes the broad test of relevance contained in s 55 of the Act. 

8As for the question as to whether or not the ""probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused"", I accept that the evidence does not directly implicate the accused. Having said that, in the circumstances of the trial as I understand them thus far, I regard the evidence as not lacking in weight. 

9As for the ""danger of unfair prejudice"", I do not regard that as particularly high. Whilst I accept that there is a possibility that the jury may jump to a conclusion (if I may use that expression), as I mentioned to defence counsel in argument, it will be perfectly open to him forcefully to explore, either by way of evidence or address, the proposition that there is no direct evidence whatsoever that the male heard on the other end of the telephone line was the accused. 

10Furthermore, it seems to me that a lack of clarity as to dates is hardly a matter that gives rise to unfair prejudice. 

11I hold the same view with regard to the fact that the evidence may be uncorroborated by phone records. 

12Finally, the fact that the witness has said that the deceased ""sounded scared and worried"", has given me pause for thought. But again, I think that that is a matter that can be explored in cross-examination. And whether or not the witness, Ms Cavers, was really in a position to express that lay opinion in a way that carries probative weight can also be explored. I also think that there is force in the proposition of the Crown that the lay opinion evidence is being given not by an acquaintance of the deceased, but rather her sister. 

13In the circumstances I am not satisfied that any aspect of paragraph 26 of the exhibit carries with it the proposition that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Accordingly the evidence will be allowed.

		29 May 2014",2014-05-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763901,RJA v R [2014] NSWCCA 89,"Judgment

1R A HULME J: On 18 August 2006 the appellant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Finnane QC to a total term of imprisonment of 21 years with a non-parole component of 16 years in respect of three offences of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years. Such an offence is contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (since amended) and the applicable maximum penalty was imprisonment for 25 years. There was also a standard non-parole period prescribed under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) of 15 years. 

2There was an appeal against sentence that was determined by this Court on 10 June 2008: RJA v R [2008] NSWCCA 137; 185 A Crim R 178. It resulted in the total term of the sentences being reduced to 17 years with a non-parole component of 13 years. The individual sentences imposed by the Court were:

Count 1 - 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years dating from 18 August 2006.

Count 3 - 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years dating from 18 August 2012.

Count 4 - 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years dating from 18 August 2009.

3The appeal did not raise a ground, as is now raised, concerning an asserted misapplication of the standard non-parole period provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That was because the appeal predated the clarification of the correct approach to that legislation set out in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

4Post-Muldrock, the appellant sought a review of his sentence pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). On 19 December 2013, Latham J referred the ""whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912"": s 79(1)(b).

Facts

5There was on the previous appeal, and now, no dispute about the facts found by the sentencing judge. They were set out in his sentencing judgment as follows:

""[8] The only mitigating factor which I could find proved was that apart from these offences, the offender should be regarded as a person of good character. He gave no evidence at the trial and gave no evidence at the sentencing proceedings. He was entitled, of course, to decline to give any evidence, but his electing to take this course has meant that I know nothing about his motivation in committing these offences and I can form no opinion about rehabilitation. I must sentence the offender, in my opinion, on the basis that he committed three serious sex offences against his eight-year-old daughter and that he has no contrition for what he has done. Furthermore, these crimes were committed during a period in which he did similar things to his daughter on about 20 or 30 occasions.

[9] The offender and TLS, the mother of the child, K, had a relationship of a sexual type during her teenage years and K was born, but at the time of the birth, the offender and TLS were no longer in a relationship. When K was about one year old, TLS contacted the offender and told him that he was the father of a girl. Commendably, he accepted responsibility for this and resumed the relationship with TLS. As a result of the resumption of this relationship, TLS had another child, a little boy, C. The four of them lived as a family until K was five years old, and C was two years old. The parties then split up again, and the offender went back to live in Narrabri. From this time until the 5th of October 2004, both parents shared the custody of the children. This meant that the children would go to live with the offender at his place of residence in Narrabri, on occasions, and with their mother in Shellharbour on other occasions. In 2003, the little boy, C went to live with his father on a more or less full-time basis.

[10] In February 2004, the father of the offender died in Narrabri and TLS took the two children to Narrabri to be with their father at the funeral. She left them in Narrabri, for a few days, and it was during this time that the first offence was committed by the offender.

[11] On the day of the funeral, the offender, and members of his family went to the funeral and to the wake. It would appear that the offender, and others in his family were drinking heavily. That night, the offender and the two children stayed at the house of one of the offender's brothers. I am satisfied that the evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the two children went to bed in a double bed, and they were joined there quite late at night, by their father, the offender. He slept between the two children. K was asleep, but she felt her father, pulling her pants down the side of her legs. He then placed his penis between her legs from the back into her vulval opening. She felt it go up and down, felt his pubic hair and notice that she was 'yucky' and 'wet inside' the vulval opening. She then got up from the bed went to the kitchen, had a drink and then went [and] slept in another bed. Her father said nothing to her about this, nor did she say anything to him.

[12] After a few days the two children went back to their mother, and stayed with her until May of that year. TLS drove the two children back to Narrabri in May and they remained with their father until later in the year.

[13] The second offence of which the offender was convicted occurred in late August 2004. The child, K, was able to say that this offence occurred just before a named schoolteacher commenced at her school in Narrabri. It was agreed by the accused that the named schoolteacher came to the school on the 30th of August 2004. During May to August 2004, the children and their father lived with his mother in a house, some distance from Narrabri. One night, when K was in bed, and the offender was there too, he stuck his hands down her pants and pushed his fingernail into her vaginal opening. This caused her pain.

[14] The third offence of which he was convicted again occurred when she was in bed with him. This was probably in September of the same year. On this occasion, he pulled her on top of him, so that they were facing each other and he moved her up and down on his penis a number of times. He did not ejaculate. She fell off on the ground and hit her head.

[15] She said in evidence that similar sexual episodes occurred on 20 or 30 occasions, and that she had made notes in a diary by marking the days when these events occurred. Despite a search by police, that diary was not found. However, in my opinion, the complainant, K was a truthful, reliable and impressive witness. She was intelligent and definite in her evidence. It is obvious that the jury had the same opinion.

...

[18] The offender was interviewed by police on the 6th of October 2004 and denied committing any sexual acts against his daughter. The jury considered those denials, but rejected them. I am certain that the jury was correct in coming to that conclusion.

[19] These events came to light on the 5th of October 2004 when the little girl, K was at the home of a friend of her mother and was showing unusual behavioural signs. When her mother inquired further, K told her what had been going on. Police were contacted and she made a video interview with police on the 6th of October 2004. At the trial she was asked why she did not speak of these events before the 6th of October 2004 and she said that she was scared.""

6The sentencing judge found that the offences of penile/vaginal intercourse in counts 1 and 4 were more serious than the offence in count 3 involving digital/vaginal intercourse. He also found that the offence in count 1 was more serious than that in count 4 because it involved ejaculation. Personally I am not sure that makes terribly much difference but the count 1 offence occurred when the complainant was aged eight whereas count 4 occurred when she was aged nine so it may be considered more serious on that account as well. In any event, this Court on the previous appeal accepted the findings of the sentencing judge concerning the comparative seriousness of the counts 1 and 4 offences as ""justifiable"": RJA v R at [48] (Spigelman CJ).

Personal circumstances of the appellant

7The appellant was aged 29-30 at the time of the offences and is now aged 39. His criminal history is limited to two drink-driving convictions. The sentencing judge accepted that he was a person of prior good character. He grew up in the Narrabri area and had generally been in employment since leaving school. 

8A body of good character evidence was presented at the sentence hearing but the judge discounted its worth on the basis that the sources did not accept the appellant's guilt as the jury at his trial had done. Good character in a sentencing context is concerned with the how an offender has conducted him/herself aside from the offending behaviour and how he/she is otherwise perceived in the community: Ryan v R [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 at [23] (McHugh J). Good character may be of less significance where there has been sustained offending over a period of time; in other words, the offending is not a one-off or isolated aberration: see, for example, R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172; 187 A Crim R 152 at [44]; Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263 at [49]; RS v R [2013] NSWCCA 227 at [42]-[48]. The approach of the sentencing judge on this issue is doubtful but nothing really turns on it because he did specifically say that he took ""prior good character"" into account as a mitigating factor; and no issue was taken on the previous appeal, or now. 

Assessment of the seriousness of the offences

9The sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of each of the offences of penile/vaginal intercourse in counts 1 and 4 as being ""at least a middle range offence"". The offence involving digital/vaginal intercourse in count 3 was assessed as ""not a middle range offence"". 

10This Court found that the count 1 and 4 offences were ""in the middle level of seriousness"". Nothing was said about the count 3 offence but it seems safe to assume that there was no disagreement with the primary judge's assessment.

The previous appeal

11The previous appeal was successful on grounds contending that the judge had erred in taking into account that the complainant was ""vulnerable because she was very young"", such a factor being inherent in the offence. Spigelman CJ acknowledged (at [13]) that ""the younger the victim the more serious the offence"". But the judge had not discriminated between the offences where she was either nine (just within the threshold for the offence against s 66A) or eight (more within that threshold). 

12The Court also upheld a ground asserting that there was error in the assessment that the offences in counts 1 and 4 were within the middle of the range of objective seriousness, but only on account of the judge's erroneous inclusion in the assessment of the vulnerability of the complainant.

13Finally, the appellant succeeded in persuading the Court that the judge had erred in imposing a longer sentence in respect of count 4 when he had found that the offence in count 1 was more serious because of the ejaculation involved. As the sentence for count 4 was the final sentence to commence through the process of accumulation, it was contended that the judge had increased it in order to achieve an appropriate ratio in the overall sentence.

14In re-sentencing, the Court accepted the judge's findings as to the objective seriousness of the counts 1 and 4 offences as I have mentioned. Contrary to the primary judge, it was of the view that there was another mitigating factor (aside from good character), that being that the appellant had a low probability of re-offending: s 21A(3)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

Ground of appeal - The Court of Criminal Appeal erred in its consideration of the standard non-parole period in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120 with respect to each count

15The ground turns on the passage in the judgment of Spigelman CJ, with whom Price and McCallum JJ agreed, at [52]-[57]. I do not intend to set it out because of its length and also because it is readily available. It is apparent that the Court adopted the approach it had advocated in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. In respect of the offences in counts 1 and 4 that were found to be in the middle of the range of objective seriousness the Court considered whether there was justification for departing from the imposition of the standard non-parole period: for example, the reference in [57] to varying the non-parole period imposed for those offences by ""reducing it from the standard non-parole period"". The reference in [54] to considering a matter ""when determining to impose a non-parole period less than the standard"" may also be regarded as the Court giving the standard non-parole period determinative significance.

16These two aspects, adopting a two-staged approach to sentencing for standard non-parole period offences and giving the standard non-parole period determinative significance, were identified as erroneous in Muldrock at [25]-[28].

17The Attorney General conceded ""Muldrock error"" in submissions concerning the Part 7 application and the Crown now makes the same concession. In my view, the concession is soundly based.

Is a lesser sentence warranted: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act?

18The finding of error enlivens a consideration of whether a lesser sentence is warranted and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

19Affidavit material read in connection with this issue establishes that since being sentenced the appellant has been on protection; he has been well-behaved; he has been employed for most of the time; he has pursued education; he has engaged in some rehabilitation programs and is prepared to do more in this vein; and he has enjoyed few visits from family members for geographical reasons in more recent times. There is also material indicating an assessment of his risk of further sex offending as ""low"". 

20The starting point in consideration of this material is that the primary judge accepted that the appellant was of otherwise good character and the Court found on the previous appeal that he had a low probability of re-offending. In this context the new material provides little more than would otherwise be expected. 

21The Crown submitted that the further material provided now does not advance the matter of rehabilitation prospects in the appellant's favour. Given the already favourable finding made by this Court in 2008, I do not think that the appellant has made out a case for much greater mitigating weight to be given on this account. The new material more provides a stronger foundation for the finding he already has in his favour.

22In relation to the appellant being on protection, there is no suggestion in the material of there being anything that has rendered his custodial experience more onerous than for most inmates of correctional centres. Indeed, an affidavit read by the respondent indicates that he is currently allowed out of his cell for 11 hours a day and he has full access to recreational, educational and entertainment facilities.

23I accept the force of the respondent's submission that even after Muldrock the standard non-parole period, like the maximum penalty, prescribed for an offence remain important legislative guideposts in the assessment of sentence: see, for example, AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 273 at [87]; Koh v R [2013] NSWCCA 287 at [106]; and Muldrock itself at [27]. Where an offence is found to be in the middle of the range of objective seriousness the standard non-parole period may have greater significance: Filippou v R [2013] NSWCCA 92 at [116]. In R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195, a case where there was a finding of ""mid-range offending"", it was accepted (at [63]) that the standard non-parole period may be a more significant factor in sentencing where there is little operating in the offender's favour. But I am not persuaded that the present appellant can be said to have little operating in his favour. Findings of prior good character and a low probability of re-offending are not insignificant.

24Acknowledging all of that, in my view the individual sentences imposed upon the appellant, and their total effect, are heavy. I am driven to the belief that when the standard non-parole period is not given determinative significance they should be less. 

25In re-sentencing I propose that the structure and order of the sentences be changed so as to more appropriately recognise the criminality inherent in each offence. The problem with the original structure of the sentences, replicated in the re-sentencing by this Court on the previous appeal, is the sentence for count 3 is entirely subsumed within the sentences for the other counts and thereby fails to reflect any additional criminality involved in that count.

26The original sentencing structure provided for a potential parole period of 5 years which meant the non-parole component represented 76 percent of the total term. The sentence structure imposed by this Court provided for a 4 year period, also providing a non-parole component being 76 percent of the total term. I am not persuaded that anything more than 4 years of potential parole is called for. The final sentence imposed will have an adjustment to its non-parole/parole proportions so as to achieve that result and for that reason alone I find that there are special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

27The total effective sentence I propose is one of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole component of 11 years.

Orders

28I propose the following orders:

1. Allow the appeal.

2. Quash the sentences imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 10 June 2008.

3. Re-sentence the appellant as follows:

Count 3 - sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole of 4 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 6 months. The sentence will date from 18 August 2006. The non-parole expired on 17 February 2011 and the total term expired on 17 August 2012.

Count 4 - sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 2 years 6 months. The sentence will date from 18 August 2007. The non-parole period will expire on 17 February 2015 and the total term will expire on 17 August 2017.

Count 1 - sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 9 years and a balance of the term of the sentence of 4 years. The sentence will date from 18 August 2008. The appellant will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 17 August 2017. The total term will expire on 17 August 2021.

		20 May 2014",2014-05-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763908,Tongahai v R [2014] NSWCCA 81,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: On 2 December 2009, after a trial running for more than 20 days, the applicant was convicted by a jury on a charge of murder. The crime resulted from the shooting of the deceased, one Solomon Penitani, at Churchill's Sports Bar in Kingsford on 26 April 2008.

2There was no dispute that the applicant fired three shots at close range, two of which hit the deceased. The prosecution case was that he intended to kill, or cause grievous bodily harm to, the deceased and that he was not acting in self-defence or under provocation. It was the mental element accompanying the shooting which was at the heart of the case.

3In very brief terms, the applicant entered the bar shortly before 4am carrying a loaded gun. He approached a man, Isaac Tautaiolefua, and demanded money from him. The deceased sought to intervene. The heated argument involving the applicant was observed by two security staff and a number of other members of the Tongan community who were in the bar that night. Whether the applicant acted in self-defence, defence of others, or with excessive self-defence or under provocation, depended upon a careful examination of the evidence concerning the disputation at the bar, which involved a number of men and moved through various parts of the premises. Most of the activity was captured on closed-circuit television (CCTV). 

4It was evident that the jury might well be assisted by a view of the premises. One purpose of the view was to identify the locations of the various CCTV cameras, in order to understand what was shown on the available footage. A view took place on the fourth day of the trial. The applicant did not attend. 

5The short point at the heart of the appeal was whether the trial judge, Buddin J, caused a miscarriage of justice by proceeding to a view with the jury in the absence of the accused. It was not in doubt that the view could take place in the absence of the accused, who was represented by his solicitor and senior counsel. Rather, the basis of the appeal was that the accused was entitled as a matter of law to attend if he wished to do so and, although counsel told the judge that the accused agreed to the view proceeding in his absence, he said he was induced to take that position as a result of an erroneous statement by the trial judge, confirmed by counsel, that he had no entitlement to be present.

Preliminary issues
6Before turning to the substance of the ground, it is necessary to deal with two preliminary issues. The first is temporal: the appeal was lodged out of time and in the course of oral argument, senior counsel for the appellant did not ultimately dispute that an extension of time was required. Rather, he submitted that it was appropriate to consider whether the ground of appeal had merit, because, if it did, the Court should extend time to determine that a miscarriage of justice had occurred and the appropriate relief.

7The second preliminary issue concerned the evidential basis for the factual premise underlying the question of law. Thus, accepting that the applicant had a right to be present at the view, did he waive that right by giving free and informed consent to the view proceeding in his absence, or was that consent vitiated by things said by the trial judge in court and by his counsel in conference? To determine the latter question, was the applicant required or permitted to give evidence of his subjective beliefs, based on what was said in Court and what was said to him by his counsel? Alternatively, in the absence of any assertion that counsel was less than competent, was the issue to be determined by reference to what was said in open court, based on the transcript (to the content of which there was no challenge)?

8Senior counsel for the applicant on the appeal submitted that the Court was entitled, and indeed required, to have regard to the applicant's own evidence. To that end he sought to read an affidavit sworn by the applicant on 5 October 2013. The Director of Public Prosecutions sought to read an affidavit of trial counsel, Robert Sutherland SC, dated 1 April 2014.

9One matter demonstrated by this issue is that the sole ground of appeal was not confined to a question of law alone. Accordingly, even if time is extended, leave is required to pursue the proposed appeal: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1).

10It is convenient to deal first with the need for an extension of time and then turn to the principles applicable with respect to the presence of the accused at a view. The relevance of the affidavit material will be revisited in the light of those principles; the conclusion as to the application can then be addressed.

Need for extension of time
11A person seeking to appeal against the person's ""conviction or sentence"" is required to give notice of intention to appeal or to apply for leave to appeal within 28 days ""after the conviction or sentence"": Criminal Appeal Act, s 10(1)(a). On one view, the provision operates disjunctively, so that notice of intention to appeal with respect to a conviction should be given within 28 days after the applicant is convicted. In any event, the court may ""at any time, extend the time within which the notice under paragraph (a) is required to be given to the court or, if the rules of court so permit, dispense with the requirement for such a notice"": s 10(1)(b). 

12A notice of intention to appeal has effect for six months after the day of filing and may be extended by the court: Criminal Appeal Rules, r 3A. A notice of appeal or an application for leave to appeal may only be given while a notice of intention has effect or, where no notice of intention has been given, within three months after the conviction or sentence. The latter period may be extended by the court before or after its expiry: r 3B.

13The records indicate that the date of conviction was the date of the jury's verdict, namely 2 December 2009. The applicant was sentenced on 26 March 2010. 

14The first notice of intention to appeal was given on 1 April 2010. During 2010 and the first part of 2011, the applicant's then solicitor filed requests for extensions of time which were granted up to 29 July 2011. 

15In 2010, the applicant had been seeking funds for an appeal to allow him to brief counsel privately. Sufficient funds not being forthcoming, an application was made for legal aid. That application was granted in order to brief counsel. Counsel was briefed and an advice received in late August 2011. The grant of aid was terminated. The applicant then instructed new solicitors and his file was transferred to them early in 2012. 

16The final extension of time lodged by the former solicitor expired on 31 August 2011. That was not discovered until the Registrar so advised the applicant's new solicitor on 2 February 2012. A further request for an extension of time, dated 2 February 2012, was refused by a deputy registrar, notice of the refusal being given by letter dated 7 February 2012. The letter noted that the decision ""does not prevent your client filing an appeal out of time with the Court, supported by an application for such an extension.""

17On 18 October 2013 a notice of appeal was filed: an extension of time was granted by the Registrar on 17 January 2014, up to 18 October 2013. On later being advised that the deputy registrar had earlier refused to extend time, the Registrar expressed the view that he had no power ""to review the decision of a deputy registrar"" and, on that basis, the decision to refuse an extension of time remained in effect. 

18While the Registrar has power to extend the periods fixed by s 10(1)(b) of the Act and by rr 3A and 3B, notice of intention having been given, it was the period for which that notice had effect that required extension beyond the nominal periods. It was not submitted that a notice could not be extended on more than one occasion, nor that the Registrar did not have power to extend time either before or after the expiry of the period, pursuant to r 3A(2). It is by no means clear that the Registrar does not have power to reverse an earlier decision to refuse an extension, although that would usually require fresh material being made available to found the exercise of the discretion. In any event, neither party submitted that this Court did not have power to grant an extension up to and including 18 October 2013, if a further extension were necessary. The Court was not invited to review either the decision of the Registrar to grant an extension or the availability of his power to, in effect, revoke his earlier decision, or if that course were open, to consider whether it was properly taken in the circumstances. 

19Because at least the evidentiary issue raised is of some importance and, despite lengthy delays, there was no demonstration that the applicant had affirmatively abandoned his intention to appeal, the extension of time to 18 October 2013 should be confirmed.

Right of accused to attend view - legal principles
20The starting point for the applicant was the ""essential principle of our criminal law that the trial for an indictable offence has to be conducted in the presence of the accused"": Lawrence v The King [1933] AC 699 at 708 (Lord Atkin). The principle was further described as an ""inviolable"" rule in respect of a trial for a felony: ibid. The distinction between felonies and misdemeanours no longer exists in New South Wales and the ""inviolable"" rule has given way to practical considerations. Lord Atkin envisaged a possible exception in the case where ""the violent conduct of the accused himself intended to make trial impossible renders it lawful to continue in his absence."" Similarly, where the accused deliberately absconds the trial may proceed in his or her absence. In modern parlance, it is the principle of procedural fairness which requires that an accused must be given every reasonable opportunity to attend his or her trial. However, it is a right and not an obligation: if the accused refuses to attend he or she cannot later demand that a conviction be quashed on the ground of his or her absence: Karamat v The Queen [1956] AC 256 at 265 (PC, Lord Goddard CJ); cf R v Hallocoglu (1991) 29 NSWLR 67 at 72 (Hunt CJ at CL). 

21There is older authority for the proposition that the accused need not be present at a view, a conclusion which appears to have been primarily based on the somewhat technical ground that ""a view is for the purpose of enabling the tribunal to understand the questions that are being raised, to follow the evidence and to apply it, but not to put the result of the view in place of evidence"": London General Omnibus Co Ltd v Lavell (1901) 1 Ch 135 at 139, cited with approval by Davidson J in Unsted v Unsted (1947) 47 SR(NSW) 495 at 498; in turn cited with approval in Scott v Numurkah Corporation (1954) 91 CLR 300 at 313 (Dixon CJ, Webb, Kitto and Taylor JJ). The proposition that a view could be conducted by a jury in the absence of accused, without invalidating the trial or conviction, was accepted in R v Martin (1872) LR 1 CCR 378 at 380-381 (Bovill CJ), considered and applied in R v Abrahams [1956] VLR 575 (Herron CJ, Martin and O'Bryan JJ), on the basis that the absence of the accused would not cause prejudice.

22It was contended in the course of the present proceeding that this line of authorities should not be followed because s 54 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) permits a jury to ""draw any reasonable inference from what it sees, hears or otherwise notices during [an] ... inspection"". Thus, it was suggested, a ""view"" was now part of the ""evidence"". 

23In Karamat, the Privy Council accepted that the ""holding of a view is an incident in and therefore part of the trial"", a characterisation accepted in Abrahams. That did not depend on what was observed during a view being treated as evidence.

24The potential importance of a view cannot reasonably be gainsaid. Similarly, the potential importance of the presence of the accused is also beyond contradiction. A view is often undertaken with a ""shower"", that is someone who points out particular features of the premises to the judge and members of the jury. There is undoubtedly room for mistakes, misunderstandings and the possibility that changes have occurred since the events in question, which the accused may be aware of but which are not identified to the jury. The simple proposition that the accused has a right or entitlement to be present during a view should be accepted as a fundamental element of procedural fairness in a criminal trial.

25The entitlement is for the benefit of the accused: it is not an obligation which can be imposed on the accused at the potential cost of causing prejudice. It is not uncommonly the case, especially in relation to serious crime where the accused has been refused bail, that significant security steps may be taken to ensure that he or she does not abscond. Thus, the jury are likely to see the accused shackled, in prison uniform and with guards in attendance. In one case, the accused was taken to the view in a prison van: R v Crossman [2011] QCA 126; [2011] 2 Qd R 435 at [22]. In applying relevant provisions of the Queensland statutes, the Court in that case (Chesterman JA, Fraser JA and Cullinane J agreeing) held that ""the trial judge could not compel the appellant to attend the view and the order that he do so was made without power so the making of it was an error of law"": at [32].

26Absent some statutory provision to the contrary, that approach should be accepted as reflecting the relevant legal principles to be applied in this jurisdiction. However, it was not the present applicant's case that he was obliged to attend on the view, nor that he was not entitled to absent himself, as he did. The proposition on which the appeal turned was a more limited one, namely that he had been misled to believe that he had no right to attend. His right to attend in this case must be accepted.

Relevance of subjective views of accused
27The statutory basis for the ground of appeal is the third limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, namely that there was a miscarriage of justice. The miscarriage was said to arise from a combination of the conduct of the trial judge and the conduct of trial counsel. As Gleeson CJ noted in Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [7], ""[t]he concept of miscarriage of justice is as wide as the potential for error. Indeed, it is wider; for not all miscarriages involve error."" He further noted that there may be a miscarriage resulting from a failure to conduct a trial in accordance with legal procedure, either where the court is unable to determine whether the resultant conviction is just or not, or where there is a departure from an essential requirement of a fair trial. In most cases, the Chief Justice continued, what has to be assessed is the procedural step taken, rather than the reasons for taking it. He continued at [9]:

""Sometimes, however, a decision as to whether something that happened at, or in connection with, a criminal trial involved a miscarriage of justice requires an understanding of the circumstances, and such an understanding might involve knowledge of why it happened. A criminal trial is conducted as adversarial litigation. A cardinal principle of such litigation is that, subject to carefully controlled qualifications, parties are bound by the conduct of their counsel, who exercise a wide discretion in deciding what issues to contest, what witnesses to call, what evidence to lead or to seek to have excluded, and what lines of argument to pursue. The law does not pursue that principle at all costs. It recognises the possibility that justice may demand exceptions. Nevertheless, the nature of adversarial litigation, with its principles concerning the role of counsel, sets the context in which these issues arise.""

28The process in the appellate court will involve an interplay of potentially conflicting principles of differing provenance. Some principles involve basic elements of the trial process, including the requirement that the tribunal must act upon admissible evidence, presented in circumstances where the accused is present and has an opportunity to test and contradict the evidence and, particularly in relation to serious crime, with the assistance of legal representation. A person accused of serious crime who is denied a reasonable opportunity to obtain representation may have a basis for setting aside a subsequent conviction: Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; 177 CLR 292. However, where an accused is represented, a further set of principles is engaged, with respect to the relationship between counsel and client. Many decisions will be taken in the course of the trial without specific instructions and some, perhaps, even against instructions. In relation to matters where counsel is required to act on instructions, as with a plea, there is likely to be an obligation, of variable content, to give advice, both legal and practical, before obtaining instructions. Subject to such considerations, it is generally said that the client will be bound by steps taken by counsel in the course of the trial. The last principle is based largely upon the practical consideration that, were it otherwise, important principles of finality would be undermined.

29In R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 Gleeson CJ (then on this Court) identified the principles that must be applied where a conviction is challenged on the basis that counsel failed adequately to present the accused's defence. A practical problem in such cases arises from the fact that only the accused and counsel will know what instructions were given, what advice was proffered and what decisions were or were not made. Those matters will not be apparent from the objective circumstances of the trial, recorded in the transcript. The principles to be applied by an appellate court in such circumstances were summarised by Gleeson CJ at 685, in the following terms:

""1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates.

2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.

3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.""

30These principles have been referred to and applied in many subsequent cases, including, quite recently, Matthews v R [2013] NSWCCA 187 at [63] (Leeming JA, Hoeben CJ at CL and Beech-Jones J). Because the circumstances in which an inquiry can properly arise as to communications between counsel and an accused are incapable of being stated with precision, it will not infrequently happen that proffered evidence must be accepted on a conditional basis and, if sought, the deponents of affidavits cross-examined. Those steps were taken in the present case, subject to a final ruling by the Court as to the admissibility of such evidence. In this case, the evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible: it is necessary to explain why that is so.

Events at trial
31The first step in all cases must be to determine objectively, by reference to the record of the trial, the basis upon which the process is said to have miscarried. The relevant passages in the transcript fall within a short compass.

32The trial commenced on Monday, 26 October 2009. Justice Buddin gave initial instructions to the jury which included reference to the fact that a view would be taken of the place where the incident occurred, which would occur on Thursday morning. The following exchange then took place between Mr Sutherland, counsel for the accused, and the trial judge:

""SUTHERLAND: Your Honour, thank you for that brief period of time. The timetable for the next few days which has been discussed with the learned Crown and with your Honour, the only additional matter I should raise is Mr Tongahai would like to be present on Thursday morning. He understands that that may require certain restrictions in relation to any positions of restraint as it were, but he would like to be there. 

HIS HONOUR: I'll have to consider whether or not administrative arrangements can be put in place for that. It's not necessarily something that happens as a right where he is represented by counsel, and obviously the question of his being secured and secured in the face of the jury is one reason why normally accused persons don't wish to be present for fairly obviously reasons. 

SUTHERLAND: If we could perhaps discuss what the administrative arrangements are for tomorrow, I'll take it up with Mr Tongahai today. 

HIS HONOUR: Putting that to one side for the moment, the administrative arrangements that I understand have been tentatively put in place, are ... 

It might be further complicated by whether or not Corrective Services can, in fact, affect [sic] having Mr Tongahai brought here and then brought to the establishment where the view will take place. So some consideration will need to be given to that. I don't know the answer to those questions. We'll work on the basis that's what he wants to do and see whether it can be given effect to that timing."" (Emphasis added.)

33That passage was said to involve a clear indication from the trial judge that the accused had no right to attend the view and that it was not normal for the accused to be present. However, the passage, read as a whole, is by no means unequivocal. Although it commenced with the judge saying that ""it"", apparently referring to the attendance of the accused at a view, did not necessarily happen as of right, in the final passage he also appeared to assume that if the accused wished to be present then that wish would be accommodated.

34On the following morning, a brief exchange took place, again in the absence of the jury:

""SUTHERLAND: Your Honour, apologies for any difficulties this may have caused with the people trying to make arrangements. My client tells me this morning, having reflected upon the interaction yesterday in court and considerations of the difficulties regarding the view, that he is content not to go tomorrow. 

HIS HONOUR: Can you let him know that that is the norm. 

SUTHERLAND: I have, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: It's rare that a person goes and because of security concerns, the accused does not want to be disadvantaged. They are dressed in prison greens, they are shackled, handcuffed. It doesn't create a very good impression on the jury. 

SUTHERLAND: That's precisely what we've reflected on overnight. I apologise for the inconvenience. 

HIS HONOUR: That being so, what we'll do is have the view at a time and in a fashion which assists the smooth running of the premises themselves. ... Thank you for that indication.""

35Later that day the trial judge made a formal order that there would be a view, noting that he had taken into account various considerations that are outlined in s 53 of the Evidence Act: Tcpt, 28/10/09, p 31(5). 

36It is appropriate to note the terms of ss 53 and 54 of the Evidence Act although, in the final analysis, nothing turns upon the application of those provisions. 

53 Views

(1) A judge may, on application, order that a demonstration, experiment or inspection be held.

(2) A judge is not to make an order unless he or she is satisfied that:

(a) the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, and
(b) the judge and, if there is a jury, the jury will be present.

(3) Without limiting the matters that the judge may take into account in deciding whether to make an order, the judge is to take into account the following:

(a) whether the parties will be present,
(b) whether the demonstration, experiment or inspection will, in the court's opinion, assist the court in resolving issues of fact or understanding the evidence,
(c) the danger that the demonstration, experiment or inspection might be unfairly prejudicial, might be misleading or confusing or might cause or result in undue waste of time,
(d) in the case of a demonstration-the extent to which the demonstration will properly reproduce the conduct or event to be demonstrated,
(e) in the case of an inspection-the extent to which the place or thing to be inspected has materially altered.
....

54 Views to be evidence

The court (including, if there is a jury, the jury) may draw any reasonable inference from what it sees, hears or otherwise notices during a demonstration, experiment or inspection.

37It is sufficient for present purposes to note that neither provision in its terms confers a right on an accused to be present at a view. Further, the requirement in s 53 that the judge be satisfied that the accused ""will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present"", in contrast to the position of the judge and jury who will be present, assumes that there is no obligation for the accused to attend.

38An objective assessment of the events recorded in the transcript leads to the following conclusions:

(1) in discussing the proposed view, the occurrence of which was not opposed, the trial judge used language which might have suggested that the accused had no right to be there despite his wish to attend;

(2) the accused was represented by experienced senior counsel who had obtained instructions before the issue of attendance was raised and who had a further discussion with the accused before a final decision was made;

(3) having discussed the matter with counsel, the accused decided not to attend, based on practical considerations as to security arrangements which might prejudice him in the eyes of the jury;

(4) if at any stage the accused had formed the view that he had no right to attend, he had the opportunity to clarify his belief with counsel before making a decision.

39The evidence proffered by the accused was to the effect that he had formed a subjective belief, based on the statement of the trial judge (set out in italics at [32] above), that he had no right to attend. Secondly, that belief was confirmed by his senior counsel. Thirdly, he asserted that, being convinced that the view was ""extremely crucial"" to his case, he only ""reluctantly agreed"" not to attend, because he understood he did not have such a right.

40This evidence triggered a response from the Director, who obtained an affidavit from trial counsel, Mr Sutherland. Both deponents were cross-examined, although the questions asked were focused and the matters were dealt with efficiently. (There was also evidence in relation to the issue of delay, to which no objection could be taken.)

41The thrust of Mr Sutherland's evidence was that he had not understood the trial judge to be denying the accused a ""right"" to attend if he wished, but rather had been stating that it was ""not something which happened automatically where an accused was represented, particularly in circumstances where custody arrangements might be perceived to be somewhat prejudicial in the eyes of an attendant jury"". He confirmed what appeared from the face of the transcript, namely that the accused changed his instructions after the discussion as to potential prejudice, an entirely practical consideration. His evidence was based primarily on what appeared in the transcript and on a file note made by his instructing solicitor. Senior counsel gave his understanding of the law and general practice in terms which made it quite improbable that he would have told the accused, if asked, that he had no legal right to be present at a view. He referred to his apology on Wednesday morning when he indicated a change in the accused's position, the apology being a response to the fact that he understood steps had been taken to arrange for the accused to be present, on the basis of his earlier indication of intention. 

42If it were necessary to determine which of the accounts given by the applicant and senior counsel was more likely to be correct, I would prefer the evidence of senior counsel. There was no suggestion that his understanding of the law or practice in criminal trials was deficient in any respect. The decision-making process he recounted was entirely plausible. On the other hand, the applicant, in an affidavit sworn in October 2013, was giving evidence of events and beliefs formed at the very beginning of his trial, in October 2009. Further, although in colloquial terms one may understand why a person says that he ""reluctantly"" agrees to forego something to which he has not right, it is more likely that his reluctant agreement was to forego a right for practical reasons.

43No final view need be formed as to the proper inferences to be derived from the evidence given by the applicant and counsel: the evidence was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. The transcript revealed a phrase used by the trial judge in an exchange with counsel. He was not advising the applicant, nor even describing trial procedure for the information of the applicant, as might occur if the applicant had been unrepresented. Reading the passage in the transcript as a whole, it is unlikely that the accused would have formed a subjective belief that he had no right to attend the view. However, if he did form such a belief it was a matter which he had an opportunity to discuss with his counsel, against whom there was no suggestion of incompetence, lack of diligence, or failing to follow instructions. The change of intention communicated by senior counsel in the second passage set out above was stated to be based on practical considerations and was in accordance with the rational expectations of those familiar with criminal trials. Those circumstances provided no warrant to investigate why particular decisions were made. They revealed no basis for concluding that there had been a miscarriage of justice. The proper outcome in these circumstances is to extend time but refuse leave to appeal.

44The Court should make the following orders:

(1) To the extent that the applicant requires an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal, grant the applicant an extension up to and including 18 October 2013 for the filing of the notice of appeal.

(2) Reject as inadmissible the evidence of the applicant and Mr Sutherland with respect to the circumstances in which the trial judge directed that there be a view to be undertaken in the absence of the accused.

(3) Refuse leave to appeal against the applicant's conviction on the charge of murder.

45FULLERTON J: I agree with Basten JA.

46DAVIES J: I agree with Basten JA.

2763909,Harris v Harrison [2014] NSWCCA 84,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: Section 91K(1) of the Water Management Act 2000 (NSW) (""the WM Act"") provides as follows:

""Meter tampering
(1) A person is guilty of an offence if the person interferes with, damages, destroys or disconnects any metering equipment that has been installed in connection with a water supply work or drainage work, and does so intentionally or recklessly. 

Tier 1 penalty.""

2By Summons filed in the Land and Environment Court on 19 January 2012, Russell Harrison (""the respondent"") alleged that, commencing on and from 21 July 2009 and continuing until 22 July 2009, the appellant committed an offence against s 91K(1) of the WM Act. Alternatively, the Summons alleged that the appellant caused or permitted the commission of the offence (see s 347 of the WM Act). On a date not disclosed in the evidence the appellant entered a plea of guilty to the primary charge. The offence is classified as a ""Tier 1 penalty"" offence. By s 363B of the WM Act and s 17 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), as at July 2009 such an offence (when committed by an individual) carried a maximum penalty of $1,100,000, and/or imprisonment for 2 years. Provision is also made for an additional daily penalty (relevantly $132,000) for each day the offence continues. Further, Ch 7, Pt 3A of the WM Act empowers the court to make a variety of additional orders, including, inter alia, ordering that a person found guilty of an offence take specified action to publicise the offence (including the circumstances of the offence) and its environmental and other consequences, and any other orders made against the offender (s 353G(1)(a)). By s 257B and s 257G of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), the Court is empowered to order an offender to pay the costs of the proceedings.

3Proceedings in the Land and Environment Court for offences against the WM Act are ""Class 5"" proceedings within the meaning of s 21 of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 (NSW). On 17 July 2013, having heard evidence and argument, Pepper J delivered judgment: Harrison v Harris [2013] NSWLEC 105. She convicted the appellant, ordered that he pay a fine of $28,000, ordered that he pay the respondent's legal costs as agreed or assessed, and, pursuant to s 353G(1)(a) of the WM Act, ordered that, at his own expense, he place, in two local newspapers, a notice in the form she specified (""the publication order""). 

4On 13 December 2013 this Court granted a stay of the publication order: Harris v Harrison [2013] NSWCCA 314.

5Pursuant to s 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) the appellant appeals to this Court against the orders. He asserts that error of various kinds can be identified in the approach taken by her Honour in the sentencing process, and that the penalty imposed in total was, in any event, manifestly excessive. He has identified 16 specific grounds of appeal. Notwithstanding the multiplicity of the grounds pleaded, the central theme of the appeal lies in the Judge's assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. Consideration of that question raises a number of complex issues, including questions of statutory construction. The appeal grounds also assert that Pepper J failed to take into account a relevant consideration. Ground 11 of the appeal specifically asserts error in making the publication order, and, in one respect, the terms of the publication ordered. In respect of the publication order, the respondent has raised a jurisdictional issue. Although the costs order is raised in the context of the ground that the penalty, in total, is manifestly excessive, there is no ground of appeal that specifically challenges that order. It will be necessary, however, to consider the consequences of the costs order.

The statutory framework

6The WM Act regulates access to water from water sources, including the Murrumbidgee River, by, inter alia, providing for licences of various kinds for the extraction of water. Access to the water in the Murrumbidgee is regulated by a ""Water Sharing Plan"" (""Water Sharing Plan for the Murrumbidgee Regulated River Water Source 2003"" (NSW)) implemented pursuant to Pt 4 of the WM Act.

7The long title of the WM Act is:

""An Act to provide for the protection, conservation and ecologically sustainable development of the water sources of the State, and for other purposes.""

8Section 3 identifies the objects of the WM Act as:

""... to provide for the sustainable and integrated management of the water sources of the State for the benefit of both present and future generations and, in particular [relevantly]:
(b) to protect, enhance and restore water sources, their associated ecosystems, ecological processes and biological diversity and their water quality, and
(d) to recognise the role of the community, as a partner with government, in resolving issues relating to the management of water sources,
(e) to provide for the orderly, efficient and equitable sharing of water from water sources,
(g) to encourage the sharing of responsibility for the sustainable and efficient use of water between the Government and water users,
(h) to encourage best practice in the management and use of water.""

9The WM Act then contains a complex series of provisions, divided into Chapters and covering a wide range of subject matters. Chapter 2 is concerned with ""Water management planning""; Chapter 3 is concerned with ""Water management implementation"". Part 1 of Ch 3 is entitled ""Basic landholder rights"". Section 52 thereof provides as follows:

""52 Domestic and stock rights
(1) Subject to subsection (2), an owner or occupier of a landholding is entitled, without the need for an access licence, water supply work approval or water use approval: 
(a) to take water from any river, estuary or lake to which the land has frontage or from any aquifer underlying the land, and
(b) to construct and use a water supply work for that purpose, and
(c) to use the water so taken for domestic consumption and stock watering, but not for any other purpose.

(2) Subsection (1) does not allow a landholder: 
(a) to take or use water in contravention of any mandatory guidelines established under section 336B, or
(b) to construct a dam or water bore without a water supply work approval, or
(c) in the case of the owner or occupier of a landholding arising from a subdivision effected on or after 1 July 2004, to take or use water in contravention of any prohibition or restriction imposed by or under the regulations (including any prohibition or restriction that the Minister is authorised by the regulations to impose), or
(d) to carry out a controlled activity without a controlled activity approval.

(3) In this section: 
domestic consumption, in relation to land, means consumption for normal household purposes in domestic premises situated on the land.
stock watering, in relation to land, means the watering of stock animals being raised on the land, but does not include the use of water in connection with the raising of stock animals on an intensive commercial basis that are housed or kept in feedlots or buildings for all (or a substantial part) of the period during which the stock animals are being raised.""

The construction of s 52 is one of the matters that arises on the appeal.

Part 2 of Ch 3 deals with ""Access licences"" and Pt 3 deals with ""Approvals"". By s 89 (in Div 1 of Pt 3) a ""water use approval"" confers on its holder a right to use water for a particular purpose at a particular location.

10Section 90 (also in Ch 3, Pt 3, Div 1) provides for approval to be given to various kinds of ""water management works"". The Dictionary defines ""water management work"", to mean, inter alia, a ""water supply work"" and ""water supply work"" to mean:

""(a) a work (such as a water pump or water bore) that is constructed or used for the purpose of taking water from a water source, or
(b) a work (such as a tank or dam) that is constructed or used for the purpose of: 
(i) ...
(ii) storing water taken from a water source, or
(c) a work (such as a water pipe or irrigation channel) that is constructed or used for the purpose of conveying water to the point at which it is to be used, 
...""

""Water source"" includes a river.

11Section 90 provides for three kinds of water management work approvals. Those relevant to the present proceedings are ""water supply work approvals"". By s 90(2) a water supply work approval authorises its holder to construct and use a specified water supply work at a specified location. Section 100 permits water management work approvals to be granted subject to conditions. Section 91H creates an offence of failing to install or maintain metering equipment in accordance with conditions imposed.

12Section 56 (which appears in Pt 2 of Ch 3) provides for the grant of ""access licences"" (also known as ""water access licences"", or ""WAL's""). By s 56(1):

""An access licence entitles its holder: 
(a) to specified shares in the available water within a specified water management area or from a specified water source (the share component), and
(b) to take water: 
(i) at specified times, at specified rates or in specified circumstances, or in any combination of these, and
(ii) in specified areas or from specified locations,
(the extraction component).""

13By s 59(1) the relevant Minister may, from time to time, by order in writing, make an ""available water determination"". The available water determination together with the number of shares specified in an access licence determines the volume of water that may be taken by a licence holder pursuant to s 56(1)(a).

14Section 57(1) provides for 12 categories of access licences of which one is:

""(k) domestic and stock access licences.""

15Division 1A of Pt 3 creates a number of offences including using water without, or otherwise than as authorised by, a water use approval (s 91A); constructing or using a water supply work without or otherwise than as authorised by a water supply work approval (s 91B), failure to install or maintain metering equipment as required by the conditions of an access licence or approval, or by direction by the Minister under s 326 (s 91H), and tampering with water metering equipment (s 91K). Division 1A of Pt 2 (Access licences) also provides for a number of offences of taking water without, or contrary to, the authority of a licence. 

16Section 326(1) empowers the Minister to direct a landholder on whose land is situated a water supply work, or any person having the control and management of such a work, to install metering equipment for use in connection with that work.

17The offences created by the WM Act are divided into three categories; in descending order of seriousness, they are ""Tier 1 penalty"", ""Tier 2 penalty"" and ""Tier 3 penalty"" offences. Section 363B provides for the penalties. In the case of Tier 1 and Tier 2 offences, the penalties vary according to whether the offender is a corporation or an individual. An additional daily penalty is prescribed where the offence is a continuing offence. A Tier 1 penalty, where the offence is committed by an individual, corresponds to imprisonment for 2 years, together with 10,000 penalty units. At the time of the appellant's offence a penalty unit equated to $110.00 (Sentencing Procedure Act, s 17), and therefore a maximum penalty of $1,100,000. By s 364(1), proceedings for offences against the WM Act are to be disposed of summarily, and may be commenced either in the Local Court, or in the Land and Environment Court. By sub-s (6), the maximum monetary penalty that may be imposed in the Local Court is the lesser of the maximum penalty specified in relation to the offence, and 200 penalty units: as at the time of the appellant's offence, $22,000. (Until 17 July 2009, just 4 days before the appellant's offence, the maximum penalty that could be imposed in the Local Court for a Tier 1 penalty offence when committed by an individual, was 50 penalty units, equating to $5,500: Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 (NSW).)

18Section 364A(1) identifies matters, to the extent that they are relevant to the specific offence under consideration, required to be taken into account in the determination of any penalty for an offence. They are:

""(a) the impact of the offence on other persons' rights under this Act,
(b) the market value of any water that has been lost, misused or unlawfully taken as a consequence of the commission of the offence,
(c) the extent of the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment (including, in particular, any water source or waterfront land) by the commission of the offence,
(d) the practical measures that may be taken to prevent, control, abate or mitigate that harm,
(e) the extent to which the person could reasonably have foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence,
(f) the extent to which the person had control over the causes that gave rise to the offence,
(g) whether the offence was committed during a severe water shortage (that is, in contravention of an order in force under section 49A or 324),
(h) the person's intentions in committing the offence,
(i) whether, in committing the offence, the person was complying with orders from an employer or supervising employee,
(j) in the case of an offence of taking water in contravention of this Act, whether the water so taken had been released for environmental purposes and, if so, whether the person was aware of that fact,
(k) any civil penalty that has been imposed on the person under section 60G in relation to the conduct from which the offence arises.""

Section 364A(2) permits the court to take into account any additional matter it considers relevant.

Background

19The appellant is one of a number of joint owners of a large mixed farming and grazing property (""Ravensworth Station"") situated adjacent to the Murrumbidgee River west of Hay in the south west of NSW. The Murrumbidgee is a ""regulated river"" within the meaning of the WM Act and, accordingly, is subject to the controls and provisions contained in the WM Act. 

20Ravensworth Station had two main sources of water: deep ground aquifers, and surface water from the Murrumbidgee. It is only the latter that is relevant to the present proceedings. Water is extracted from the river by pump, of which there were, at the relevant time, five (four operational) located at two pump stations on the banks of the Murrumbidgee. Once sourced, water is directed via a series of above ground channels to various locations on the property, for use in crop irrigation, for stock, and for domestic purposes. Water for domestic purposes is pumped into an irrigation channel known as ""the main channel"". The main channel is 22 kilometres long, and eventually feeds into a dam near the main residence known as ""the house dam"". This Court was told that along the length of the main channel, there are a number of access points through which water can be directed to other parts of the property. The main channel has a maximum capacity of approximately 150 megalitres. The house dam has a maximum capacity of 2-3 megalitres. In order to convey water from the Murrumbidgee to the house dam it is necessary, for gravitational reasons, to feed into the main channel a good deal more water than the 2-3 megalitres than would be sufficient to fill the house dam. Although it was mentioned only in passing, it seems that there is also a water treatment plant that enables water to be rendered suitable for domestic use, including drinking. The evidence does not disclose how or where this water is stored, or the capacity of any tanks or other storage facilities used for that purpose.

21The appellant held (at least) three approvals under s 90 for the construction of water supply works (pumps) to source water from the Murrumbidgee. The approvals were subject to a number of conditions, one of which was:

""3 The approval holder must install, maintain and operate any device or devices for measuring the volume of water extracted by the approved works in accordance with any manufacturer's specifications, when required in accordance with any written directions from the Minister.""

Another was:

""5 The approval holder must inform the Department of Water and Energy within seven (7) days if the device or devices used for measuring the volume of water taken from the approved work ceases to record water usage accurately ...""

22Whether these conditions were intended to operate as a requirement that the appellant install meters on the three pumps is not clear. The word ""any"" in Condition 3 would not suggest such a requirement, merely a requirement that if a meter were to be installed, it be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. Condition 5, however, seems to proceed on the basis that a meter is required. It was common ground that no direction to install a meter on any pump had been issued by the Minister under s 326.

23The appellant, either alone or jointly with others (presumably the co-proprietors of Ravensworth Station) held a number of water access licences. These permitted water in specified quantities to be taken from the Murrumbidgee for irrigation purposes and crop watering. 

24Somewhat curiously, one of the licences held by the appellant (jointly with others) was identified as Water Access Licence (""WAL"") 8309. WAL 8309 permitted the appellant to draw 619 megalitres of water per annum from the Murrumbidgee for ""domestic and stock"" purposes. It is likely that WAL 8309 was a domestic and stock access licence issued under s 57(1)(k). I say ""somewhat curiously"" because WAL 8309 appears to replicate (although with limitations) the rights the appellant had under s 52. That is, s 52 permitted him to take (unlimited) water for ""domestic consumption and stock watering"", WAL 8309 authorised him to take a limited quantity of water (619 megalitres per annum) for identical purposes.

25Some attempt was made in a Statement of Agreed Facts put before Pepper J to explain the apparent anomaly. A domestic and stock water access licence is issued where the same ""water supply work"" (eg a pump) is used to take water for s 52 purposes and for irrigation. The licence enables measurement of water taken for the two different purposes. What was not explained was how the separate measurements were achieved, or how (if at all) they impacted on any payments required.

26At the time of the offence, there were four operational pumps located at a site on Ravensworth known as the ""Central Pump Site"". Each was fitted with two meters: one meter recorded the volume of water extracted from the river, the other recorded its hours of operation. 

The proceedings in the Land and Environment Court

27The appellant notified his plea of guilty at an early stage.

28The facts relevant to the offence were put before her Honour by way of an Agreed Statement. After some negotiation, an Amended Statement of Agreed Facts was provided. In addition, her Honour had available affidavits sworn on behalf of the respondent by Paul Gavin Simpson and Craig Robert Jones. Mr Simpson was cross-examined. On behalf of the appellant the evidence consisted of an affidavit sworn by him and affidavits sworn by Phillip Kaunitz and Michael Eberand. The appellant was cross-examined at some length. Both parties provided detailed written and oral submissions. 

The facts of the offence

29To a large extent, the objective facts were not in dispute. Some factual conclusions reached by her Honour, to which I will come, were, and remain, in dispute. The undisputed facts are as follows.

30At about 5.00pm on 21 July 2009 the appellant inserted a steel rod into the volume meter of one of the pumps (""pump 1"") at the Central Pump Site. His purpose in doing so was to interfere with the operation of the meter, and prevent it recording the volume of any water pumped from the Murrumbidgee. The insertion of the steel rod constituted the offence to which the appellant pleaded guilty. He then turned on the pump. Water was pumped from the Murrumbidgee into the main channel. The taking of the water was not an element of the offence. The ""hour meter"" on pump 1 was, at that time, not operational. Accordingly, there was no metered record of the volume of water taken at that time. The appellant had previously manufactured the steel rod, which was thereafter left at the pump site. He had used it for the same purpose on at least one previous occasion. 

31After doing this, the appellant left the area. He did not return until about 10.00am the following morning.

32The appellant knew that it would take some time for the pumped water to flow along the main channel and into the house dam. That was why he did not return to the Central Pump Site until about 10.00am the following morning. It was, no doubt, the continued operation of the pump over that time that caused the respondent to charge a ""continuing offence"" within the meaning of s 363B of the WM Act. (However, as no additional penalty was imposed, it is not necessary to consider this further.)

33On the morning of 22 July 2009, at about 10.00am, two officers of the State Water Corporation (""State Water"") (Brett Richardson and Phillip Dempsey) attended the Central Pump Site on Ravensworth. The evidence does not disclose their purpose in doing so. They observed that pump 1 was operating, and feeding water from the Murrumbidgee into the main channel, and that the meter was not operating. It was shortly thereafter that the appellant arrived at the Central Pump Site. He had a conversation with the two officers, who told him that the volume meter was not operating. (The hour meter was also not operating, but that is not material to the present proceedings.) The appellant turned off pump 1, and turned on a second pump, on which a volume meter was operating. The pump was therefore operating continuously without the meter functioning, over a period of about 17 hours. The appellant estimated that in that time it would have extracted 30-40 megalitres of water. 

The appellant's motivation in tampering with the meter: relevant evidence

34The appellant's purpose in pumping the water was one of the principal matters in dispute. His evidence was that his purpose was to feed water into the house dam, via the main channel, to be used for domestic purposes in accordance with his ""basic landholder rights"" conferred by s 52. There was no statutory obligation to meter water taken for that purpose. 

Events following the commission of the offence

35The State Water officers then examined the meter on pump 1, and discovered the steel rod. They contacted compliance officers from the NSW Office of Water (""NOW""). (I use the terminology that appears in the evidence. It is likely that State Water and NOW are the same entity.) Two compliance officers from NOW (Greg Delmenico and Kerry Hehir) attended in the early afternoon. They, too, observed the steel rod in the meter of pump 1. They contacted the appellant by telephone and he joined them at the Central Pump Site shortly thereafter. They had a conversation with him in which they introduced themselves and told him that they were present to investigate an allegation about interference with the water meter. The conversation which ensued was electronically recorded. A transcript of the conversation was in evidence. The following extracts from the conversation, as recorded in the transcript, are material to the issues raised in the appeal:

""Q15 Ron, I guess - what can you tell us about the matter of the meter not working?
A Err there was either the rod there, isn't it?

...

Q17 So you agree that the rod was interfering with the meter?
A It seems to be.

Q18 Okay. Do you know anything about that rod being up the pipe?
A Well, the rod's up the pipe anyhow.

Q19 Okay. You don't know who placed it there?
A No, the rod's up the pipe though.

...

Q22 You agree it appeared to be interfering with the meter working?
A The (indistinct) seems to be that way.

Q23 Yeah, okay. Did you put the rod up the pipe, Ron?
A I'm not too sure.

Q24 Okay, so you're not sure whether you put it up there?
A I don't know whether I was there when that - when it happened or not ... could have been.

...

Q26 Okay. Who else could have maybe put the rod up the pipe?
A It could have been the employee.

Q27 What's the employee's name?
A I couldn't tell you that now.

Q28 You don't know --
A No, just say - just say meself, you put my name down there.

Q29 So you knew the pipe rod was going up the pipe.
A Yeah.

Q30 -- to interfere with the meter?
A Mm.

Q31 Why did you authorise your employee to do that?
A I don't know. It doesn't matter, it's done.

Q32 Okay. What was the water being used (sic), Ron?
A To fill the house dam at the moment.

Q33 Right, so how long had the rod been up the pipe?
A Yesterday, last night.

Q34 Last night, about what time?
A At - I don't know, 5 o'clock or something like that.

...

Q39 Okay, alright. So apart from putting the rod up the pipe interfering with the meter last night at 5 o'clock to fill a house dam --
A Mm mm

Q40 -- have you ever done that before?
A Done it before?

Q41 Yeah.
A It probably has been done once or twice before.

Q42 Okay. With your knowledge?
A Sometimes without my knowledge.

Q43 So an employee?
A Once upon a time the water - I didn't understand it not long ago.

Q44 You didn't understand what exactly?
A And then it might have happened once or twice.

Q45 Alright, so - but you weren't aware of it --
A Mm mm.

Q46 -- those other times? Okay. Has the rod ever been up the pipe interfering with the meter with water being pumped into one of the irrigation storages or applied to any crops?
A Sometimes when it goes to the house dam, it does goes (sic) past there and goes into the crop sometimes yes

Q47 Okay. Could you --
A It wouldn't have been - it hadn't been done too often.

Q48 Could you estimate volumes?
A No.

...

Q65 I guess, Ron, did you know it was wrong to put the rod up the pipe to interfere with the meter?
A Yeah, I suppose I did, yeah.

...""

In cross-examination the appellant explained his answer to question 46 in the following way:

""No, what I meant there when you fill up the channel near the house dam at the school bus stop you fill - usually we keep the channel always full of water so when we want to fill up the house dam we can quickly and sometimes there you're still - if you start irrigating you irrigate too but you don't let the channel drop down, you try and keep the head up in the channel, at all times because not only does it just feed the water to the house dam it also feeds our livestock on the other side of the road.""

36On 20 November 2009 Mr Craig Jones (also a compliance officer with NOW) and Mr Hehir attended at Ravensworth, by arrangement, for a further interview with the appellant. A transcript of that interview was also in evidence. The following questions and answers, as recorded, are relevant:

""Q260 Yes. Do you agree you said you used the number 1 Caterpillar Diesel Pump?
A Yes.

Q261 When did you start that pump?
A The day before.

Q262 So that would be 21 July?
A Yes.

Q263 Do you know what time you started it?
A I'm not too sure. It was late in the afternoon.

Q264 Who did start the pump?
A I did.

Q265 Was anyone with you?
A No.

Q266 Did you check the water meter after you started the pump?
A No.

Q267 Where were you pumping water to?
A In the channel.

Q268 Once it had gone into the channel, where did you intend the water to go?
A In the house dam.

Q269 How much water did you want to deliver to the house dam?
A I had to fill the channel up first but the house dam didn't take much.

Q270 How much does it take to fill that channel?
A It'd take easy 100 megs. It might even be more, 150 megs maybe.

Q271 Was there any water in the channel at the time?
A There was some; not a lot. Very little on this end; virtually none. Only puddle - only puddle holes sort of thing.

Q272 So in general terms would you describe the channel as wet or dry?
A Dry. It had some on the bottom and that was all.

...

Q276 So what do you think the capacity of the house dam is?
A It might only be a couple of megs, two or three megs.

Q277 To fill the house dam on this, what's pretty well dry channel, how many megs do you think you'd have to pump to get it down there?
A I'd say you'd need probably 100, 150 megs altogether.

Q278 Yes. The water that was going to the house tank, what was the intended use of that water?
A It was going for the houses.

Q279 When you say for the houses, do you agree it was for general domestic use in those houses?
A Mm.

Q280 Such as drinking?
A Mm.

Q281 Washing?
A Mm.

Q282 Showering?
A Mm.

Q283 And garden, domestic garden watering?
A Yes.

Q284 Once the house tank was full, where would water go to after that if it continued to be pumped?
A Most times we keep it in the channel but then after that it can go to irrigation. But most times it just sits in the channel. We usually keep the channel full so that if you've got to top the dam up you can real quick and you can just open the gate up again and it doesn't take much to fill it up. But this particular time the channel was right empty. 

Q285 Whilst you were filling the house tank, was anyone monitoring where the water was going?
A No, but because it wasn't - it had only just got there. It was only just starting to get there.

...

Q289 Do you agree earlier that I said the NSW Office of Water compliance officers located an object up the outlet pump of the number 1 river pump on 22 July?
A Yes.

Q290 Have you seen that object before?
A Yes.

Q291 What would you call it?
A A steel rod. A stick. A steel rod.

Q292 Can you tell me how the steel rod got into the pump outlet?
A Yeah, I put it there.

Q293 When did you put it there?
A The day before when I started the pump.

Q294 Do you know what time it would have been?
A Late in the afternoon.

Q295 What was your intention in putting the rod up there?
A I was trying to fill the channel up so that I can get some water for my house dam because it was empty 

...

Q300 After you inserted the rod into the pipe, what did you do?
A Started the pump.

Q301 Did you check the meter after you started the pump?
A No.

Q302 Who manufactured the steel rod?
A I did.

Q303 When did you make it?
A Can't remember. Before (indistinct).

Q304 How did you make it?
A In the workshop.

Q305 What's it made out of?
A Steel.

...

Q307 Where did you normally keep the steel rod?
A Just there. And it was just there at the pump site.

...

Q311 Have you used that steel rod on any previous occasions?
A I might have used it once before.

...

Q316 Why did you want the meter to stop?
A So I can fill my house dam up because the channel's low.

Q317 You could have filled the house dam though with the meter operating.
A Mm.

Q318 So why did you want the meter stopped?
A I just did. I did something I shouldn't have done. I know that.

Q319 Do you agree by stopping the meter working properly that your account probably wouldn't be debited for the water that you extracted?
A Yes.

Q320 Was it your intention not to be debited that water?
A Yes.

...""

There followed a number of questions and answers it is not necessary here to record. Some time later the following question was asked and answer given:

""Q408 Sorry, just looking at how much water was in the channel and whether it reached the house dam or not, could you make a reliable estimate of how much water you'd pumped from how much water was in the channel or in that house dam?
A No, not really because the water had only just got to the house dam. At that time it had only just got to the - not to the house dam, it only got to the end of the school bus stop where the water stops. It only just got there from - and we also had another pump going at the same time so the water was just there. It depends. I didn't go along the channel to see where it actually was. I just know the next morning the channel was chock a block full and the house dam was full. 

...""

37In his affidavit, the appellant explained why he had disabled the meter. He said that, on the afternoon of 21 July, he noticed that the house dam was becoming low. He intended to release some water from the main channel to fill the dam, but found that there was insufficient water in the channel to allow gravitational feeding into the house dam. For this to occur, it was necessary to pump water from the Central Pump Station into the channel. To do this, he wished to make use of his basic landholder's right under s 52 of the WM Act to take unmetered water for domestic or stock purposes. Access to water from the Murrumbidgee under that right did not require metering. 

38Given the distance between the Central Pump Station and the house dam (22 kilometres) it typically takes about two days for water to travel from the Central Pump Site to the house dam. It takes another two days for the water to be filtered through the water treatment plant. For this reason, the appellant said, his usual practice was to maintain a high level of water in the main channel. Why this was not the case in July 2009 was not explained, but the appellant said that at ""this particular time the channel was right empty"".

39In paragraphs 49 and 50 of his affidavit the appellant said:

""49 As I was intending to use the water to fill up the House Dam, and I understood that we were entitled to use Domestic and Stock Water for that purpose without it being ordered or metered, I did not want to use water allocated to the General Security Licence that could otherwise be used to irrigate commercial crops on Central Farm. That was a particular concern to me around this time because I was aware that there was a water shortage in the Murrumbidgee Regulated River Water Source.

50 For that reason, at about 5pm on 21 July 2009, I placed a rod in the pipe of the water flow meter for the pump known as ""pump 1"" at the Central Pump Site so that the water that was pumped for the purposes of the House Dam would not be debited to our water account. I then turned on pump 1.""

40He said that when he returned to the Central Pump Site at 10am on 22 July (when he encountered Messrs Richardson and Dempsey) he did so with the intention of turning off pump 1 and turning on another (metered) pump. This would mean that the balance of water taken would be recorded on the meter of that pump.

The evidence of the appellant

41The appellant's answers in cross-examination are not easy to interpret. For example, he was asked about his answer to question 46 in the first interview. The following questions and answers appear in the transcript of evidence:

""Q I take you to question 46 [of the first interview, extracted above], do you accept you were asked this question, 'those other times, okay, has the rod ever been up the pipe interfering with the meter with water being pumped into one of the irrigations (sic) storages or applied to any [crops]?' Answer 'Sometimes when it goes to the house dam, it goes past there and goes into the crop sometimes, yes'. Do you accept that was the answer you gave in question 46?
A Yes.

Q So you told the person asking the question that you'd used the rod sometimes which means more than once, doesn't it?
A No, what I meant there when you fill up the channel near the house dam at the school bus stop you fill - usually we keep the channel always full of water so when we want to fill up the house dam we can quickly and sometimes there you're still - if you start irrigating you irrigate too but you don't let the channel drop down, you try and keep the head up in the channel at all times because not only does it just feed the water to the house dam it also feeds our livestock on the other side of the road.

...

Q In any event lets look at the answer, 'and goes into the crop sometimes', can you use the red pen and mark with whatever shape is appropriate, a circle, a square, where you're referring to 'it sometimes went into the crop'?
A What I'm trying to say there - all the time what I tried to say there is it's a double edged sword there. We fill the channel up and when the channel's full and that's where we keep it full so we've got our stock order for the other side of the road and we also keep it full so we can fill the house dam at any time - when you want to find out your house dam's low you can go and open the gate and fill it and then sometimes there if you're irrigating your crops later on when you want to irrigate your crops, well, what pallets of water - I've been to the dam and there's two lots of water in there sort of thing so when you want to irrigate your crops you still keep the channel at the same height. It's a bit hard question to answer, sir.

...

Q So on one occasion at least previously when you've used the rod the water was used to irrigate crops, wasn't it?
A No.

...

Q Having been taken to those answers didn't you say previously that on at least one occasion the water extracted after using the rod on the meter had been used to go on the crops?
A All the time I said when we filled up the channel all the time - we try and keep the channel full all the time for your livestock on the other side of the road and your Pethers (?) block and also fill our house dam up. At the same time if you can irrigate on the other side, well sometimes the water - you always keep that channel full and water can still go past onto the other side.

...

Q So once the house dam is filled the water left in the channel, some of that goes to irrigating crops, doesn't it?
A It's only when you start pumping to go to irrigate you still keep the channel full, the channel is still full.

Q So some of the water used to fill the house dam once you recommence pumping, that existing water would then used to be irrigate that was in the channel?
A No, it'll still be equivalent because you've still got the channel full and the water runs over the top, over the other side, so you kept the channel full.

Q Can you explain that running over the top?
A Well, or you can keep the channel at a certain height and while you're there you just regulate your pipes at the other end, at the gate, so as X amount of water is coming down you keep the channel height exactly the same, you don't drop the level so you keep the same volume of water in that channel at all times so you don't drop the volume of water that's in that channel.

Q So are you saying none of the water already in the channel that's moved along?
A It's only got new water coming from the pump site, new water comes in and move over, it might mix up but the channel is always still full.

Q So some of the water existing in the channel in the way you've described would then be used to irrigate?
A No, it depends. You can't tell which water it was that was in there. You use a common channel.

...

Q And if you hadn't been detected on 22 July 2009 the plan was to fill your channel for the whole 22 kilometres?
A That's why I went and swapped over and put the other motor on and I also had - there was two other pumps pumping into that channel that day. There was also one pump in storm water. 

Q So as I understand it you say about 10am on 22 July you turned up to stop the pump pumping to which the rod was connected?
A Yes.

Q If all you wanted to do was fill the house dam for two to three megalitres you could have done that, that is, stock [sic - ? stop] the rod being around the meter on the afternoon or evening of 21 July 2009 so that only about two to three megalitres went?
A No.

Q Why not?
A Because you had to build the channel head level up high enough to get the water to gravitate into the house dam.""

42In oral evidence the appellant agreed that that part of his answer to question 295 in the second interview, that the house dam had been empty, was incorrect. He said that the house dam ""might have been a third full"".

43Throughout his oral evidence, the appellant maintained that his intention in disabling the meter was to facilitate the exercise of his rights under s 52 of the WM Act. He did not wish his entitlement under WAL 8309 to be debited with water to which he was entitled to have free access. 

44The appellant was extensively cross-examined. He was asked about the apparent evasiveness in his responses to Mr Delmenico in the initial interview. He said this was:

""... because I was just told there was an offence committed and I was devastated really and I've got the officers there and I'm not too sure what you should say or do then.""

Asked if he panicked, he said:

""I'm not too sure, I didn't have any representation or anything there."" 

45Concerning his intention in disabling the meter, what was, in effect, put to the appellant in cross-examination was that his intention was to fill the main channel with unmetered water taken pursuant to his s 52 rights, but, consistently with his answers to question 284 in the second interview, and consistently with past practice, after filling the house dam, to use the water remaining in the channel to irrigate crops. This would be an impermissible use of water taken under s 52. It was in response to these questions that the appellant gave the answers recorded at para [41] above. It was never clearly or directly put to the appellant that his motive in disabling the meter was financial gain, nor that his intention was to use the unmetered water (or some of it) to irrigate crops and to avoid paying for that water.

46As I have noted, the appellant's answers are not easy to interpret. It seems to me that what he was saying was that he intended to exercise his s 52 rights to provide water to the house dam. This entailed taking more water than the 2 to 3 megalitres that would fill that dam, because of the need to create sufficient force for the water to ""gravitate"" to the dam. (There was no evidence as to the gradient of the main channel, but there was no challenge to his evidence in this respect.) The consequence was that, after the house dam filled, there remained some unmetered (s 52) water in the main channel. By reason of s 52(1)(c) that water could not be used for any purpose other than domestic or stock requirements. However, having taken sufficient water to fill the house dam, the appellant then intended to switch pumps, in order to obtain metered water that could be used for irrigation purposes. The inevitable result would be a mingling of unmetered and metered water. Some of the (unmetered) water pumped by pump 1 was at least available for irrigation purposes (whether actually used for that purpose or not). What, it seems to me, the appellant was saying was that, to the extent that this occurred, he made good so much of the unmetered (s 52) water used for irrigation by replacing it with metered water. 

47It is reasonably clear that the appellant could make no precise assessment of the quantity of unmetered water taken via pump 1, and that taken via a metered pump. That, however, is a consequence of a number of factors, including that the main channel had to be used to funnel water for both s 52 purposes, and for irrigation and any other non-s 52 purpose.

48Cross-examination of the appellant established that he had, prior to the offence, planted a considerable wheat crop which it was hoped would eventually realise ""some millions of dollars"". He had also (as deposed in his affidavit) placed an order for 300 megalitres of water. That water had not, at the time of the offence, been made available. What is not clear is when it would have become available and when the appellant required it for the purpose of the wheat crop.

Sentencing considerations 

49It was common ground that, in addition to the specific provisions of s 364A of the WM Act, the Sentencing Procedure Act applies in the determination of an appropriate penalty for an offence under the WM Act. Section 21A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act contains a comprehensive catalogue of circumstances that a court must take into consideration as features aggravating an offence. Relevantly for the present case, that sub-section identifies as an aggravating factor:

""... that the offence was committed for financial gain."" (s 21A(2)(o))

50Those matters listed in s 364A of the WM Act that are, by reason of the issues raised on the appeal, here relevant are those mentioned in sub-paras (a)-(h). 


The issues in the Land and Environment Court

51The hearing in the Land and Environment Court occupied two days. Two witnesses, Mr Simpson and the appellant, gave evidence at length, and were extensively cross-examined. Mr Simpson's affidavit evidence appears to have been primarily directed to establishing that the offence was committed during a period of ""severe water shortage"" (s 364A(1)(g)). If that were so, it would operate as a circumstance increasing the seriousness of the offence. Otherwise, in his affidavit, Mr Simpson explained the water management system. Cross-examination of the appellant was principally directed to establishing that he committed the offence for the purpose of obtaining, without payment, water for irrigation - that is, he committed the offence for financial gain.

52At the conclusion of the hearing, each party provided her Honour with written submissions. By this time, the issues were more clearly defined. The respondent identified as relevant the following:

(i)the volume of unmetered water taken;

(ii)the market value of the water;

(iii)""the intention and motive"" of the appellant in committing the offence, and, in particular, whether there was any financial gain, whether by not incurring an expense that would otherwise have been incurred or otherwise;

(iv)whether the offence was committed during a ""severe water shortage"" (see s 364A(1)(g));

(v)whether the offence was or was not an ""uncharacteristic aberration"";

(vi)whether the water taken during the commission of the offence fell within the appellant's domestic consumption rights as provided by s 52 of the WM Act;

(vii)whether, if the water was taken in the exercise of rights under s 52, it needed to be metered.

53An important concession was made by the respondent in the Land and Environment Court. That was that, at the time of the offence, there did not exist in any relevant legislation any requirement that a water meter be installed for pump 1. (Such requirements may be imposed by way of conditions on approvals (s 90) or licences (s 56), and they may be imposed by direction of the Minister under s 326 of the WM Act.)

54It was also explicitly recognised that the appellant was not charged with any offence of taking water unlawfully.

55The issue that occupied the largest proportion of the time taken in the Land and Environment Court was the appellant's motivation in committing the offence. Another issue, that does not appear to have taken a great deal of time, was whether s 52 was applicable - that is whether the appellant had rights under that section. Since this issue was resolved in his favour, it is unnecessary to explore the detail of the respondent's contention. I mention it here because it is relevant to the appeal so far as the costs order is concerned.

The judgment

56The judgment is comprehensive. The bulk of it is taken up with the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. Some matters, no longer in dispute, can be disposed of at the outset:

(a)her Honour rejected an argument put on behalf of the respondent that the offence was ""part of a planned or organised criminal activity"" (Sentencing Procedure Act, s 21A(2)(n)) (paras [148]-[152]);

(b)she rejected another contention put on behalf of the respondent that the offence was committed during a ""severe water shortage"", and, therefore, in accordance with s 364A(1)(g), aggravated (paras [115]-[127]). (She held, however, as a factor relevant to objective seriousness, that there was a ""water shortage"" (even if not severe) at the time of the offence);

(c)she found the market value of the water taken to have been between $5130 and $6840, and the water ""not of significant monetary value"";

(d)she considered various other matters under s 364A. They will be mentioned below.

The assessment of the objective gravity of the offence

57For the purposes of this appeal it is her Honour's consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence that principally commands attention. That consideration had a number of aspects.

58Perhaps the most significant finding with respect to the assessment of objective gravity was a finding that the offence was committed for financial gain ([99]). That was treated as an aggravating factor that was (as it had to be) proved beyond reasonable doubt. In reaching this conclusion her Honour rejected the appellant's evidence that his purpose in tampering with the meter was to enable him to take unmetered water in accordance with his statutory rights. She found as a fact that a significant proportion of the 30-40 megalitres of water pumped during the commission of the offence was to be utilised for the purposes of the wheat crop that had been planted. 

59In coming to this conclusion, her Honour made no direct findings concerning the credibility of the appellant. Instead, she relied upon six aspects of the evidence from which she drew the inference that the appellant's intention was to acquire the water for the purposes of irrigation. In particular, her Honour made no findings with respect to the appellant's evidence to the effect that he intended to pump metered water into the main channel to balance any unmetered water used for irrigation. The six matters upon which her Honour relied were:


the appellant's answer, in the second interview:

""Most times we keep it in the channel but then after that it can go to irrigation."";


his answer given in the first interview:

""Sometimes when it goes to the house dam, it goes past there and goes into the crop sometimes, yes."";


an acknowledgement given in cross-examination by the appellant that it would have been open to him to have taken 2 to 3 megalitres of water pursuant to his s 52 rights, and then used another (metered) pump and ""another account"" to pump the water necessary to provide the gravitational force that would project the water into the house dam;


the fact that the appellant had planted a wheat crop for which he had ordered 300 megalitres of water which had not arrived at the time of the commission of the offence;


the fact that it had been a dry winter and there was a water shortage in the area;


the fact that only a small proportion of the 30 to 40 megalitres pumped during the meter tampering was capable of being used for domestic consumption.

60Her Honour said:

""96 I have no hesitation in finding that the water pumped by [the appellant] was not wholly to be used for 'domestic consumption' as claimed by [the appellant], but that a significant proportion of the 30 to 40 ML pumped during the commission of the offence was to be utilised by [the appellant] for irrigation of his wheat crop. This was not a permissible purpose under s 52 of the [WM Act] and [the appellant] cannot rely on it in mitigation.

97 Moreover, in my opinion, acting lawfully pursuant to an exercise of rights under s 52 could only authorise the extraction of sufficient water to fill the House Dam. Otherwise the provision would give those water users with a domestic dam some distance from the water source a considerable advantage over those whose dams were closer in proximity to the extraction source. I do not believe that this was the objective intention of the legislature in enacting s 52 of the [WM Act].""

61Notwithstanding these significantly adverse findings, her Honour found that the offence was of ""low objective gravity"".

62Other conclusions were also relevant to the assessment of objective gravity. These were:

(i)at [110]: that ""real harm was nevertheless caused to the regulatory regime enshrined in the [WM Act], a regime created to protect and manage one of our most vital and scarce resources, viz, water"" (WM Act, s 364A(1)(c));

(ii)at [114]: that extraction of water other than in accordance with the regulated scheme ""upsets the equitable sharing system in place under the [WM Act]"" (s 364A(1)(a));

(iii)that, although there was no ""severe water shortage"" at the time of the offence (s 364A(1)(g)), there was, nevertheless, a water shortage (s 364A(2));

(iv)at [144]: that the harm caused by the offence was reasonably foreseeable (s 364A(1)(e));

(v)at [146]: that there were practical measures available to avoid the harm (s 364A(1)(d));

(vi)at [147]: that the appellant was in control of the causes of the offence (s 364A(1)(g)).

Other penalty considerations

63Her Honour turned to consider mitigating factors. These were agreed and were as follows:


the appellant has no prior criminal history, and has not been charged with any previous water offence;


but for the commission of the offence the appellant was a person of good character;


the appellant was unlikely to re-offend;


the appellant has good prospects of rehabilitation; 


the appellant entered a very early plea of guilty entitling him to a 25 per cent reduction in the penalty that would otherwise have been imposed: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383; 


the appellant provided assistance to authorities to the extent that he voluntarily participated in two interviews in which he made various admissions; he co-operated with investigators by showing the NOW officers around the property; and he assisted in the preparation of the Amended Statement of Agreed Facts.

She accepted that the appellant expressed a degree of remorse although she noted that he had never apologised for the unlawful act. She regarded the appellant's adherence to his position that he tampered with the meter in order to exercise his rights under s 52 of the WM Act as inconsistent with contrition or remorse.

64In all, she considered that the subjective circumstances operated to mitigate the penalty that would otherwise have been imposed and determined that a reduction of 30 per cent was appropriate. That incorporated the reduction attributable to the plea of guilty. Her Honour considered that the appropriate penalty referable to the objective circumstances was one of $40,000, and reduced that by 30 per cent to arrive at the $28,000 penalty she ultimately imposed.

65She considered that both specific and general deterrence were relevant considerations, as were denunciation and retribution. 

Other orders

66Her Honour acceded to the application of the respondent that the appellant be ordered to pay the costs of the prosecution, recognising that those costs would be ""not insignificant"". 

67She then made the publication order to which I have referred above. She accepted a proposal as to the content put on behalf of the respondent that the notice be in the following terms:

""Publication Order - Ronald Norman Harris Convicted of Meter Tampering
On 17 July 2013, the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales found Ronald Norman Harris of Ravensworth, Hay, NSW guilty of an offence against the Water Management Act 2000, in that he intentionally interfered with or disconnected metering equipment that had been installed in connection with a water supply work.

The Court found that in July 2009 Mr Harris had tampered with a water meter connected with a pump installed to pump water from the Murrumbidgee River. Mr Harris had tampered with the water meter by attaching a steel rod around the water meter's impellor which prevented the meter from recording the volume of water being pumped from the River. 

At the time of the offence there existed a water shortage in the Murrumbidgee Regulated River Water Source. The relevant Water Sharing Plan was suspended on 10 November 2006 because the water resources available were so limited that the provisions of the Water Sharing Plan could not be implemented. The Murrumbidgee Regulated River had moved into drought conditions from that date and remained effectively in drought conditions until February 2010. The Water Sharing Plan continued to be suspended until 16 September 2011.

Mr Harris was fined $28,000 and ordered to pay the prosecutor's legal costs as agreed or assessed.

Mr Harris was prosecuted by the NSW Office of Water and was ordered by the Land and Environment Court to place this notice in this publication.

The NSW Office of Water is now part of the NSW Department of Primary Industries.""

68She rejected a proposal put on behalf of the appellant that the notice include:

""Mr Harris was extracting the water to fill up his house dam and the channel leading to it.""

The grounds of appeal

69The grounds of appeal pleaded are numerous. On behalf of the appellant it was asserted that a number of errors can discerned in the approach taken by her Honour to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. The principal attack was made upon the finding that the appellant committed the offence for financial gain. This, in itself, had a number of strands. In part the finding rested upon the conclusion at [97] set out above ([60]). That was that s 52 of the WM Act entitled the appellant to take only sufficient water to fill the house dam - 2-3 megalitres. The rationale for that conclusion was that, if it were not so, then water users with a dam some distance from the water source would acquire a significant advantage over others. It appears that her Honour considered that the quantity of water taken during the commission of the offence so far exceeded the appellant's s 52 rights (as she considered them to be) that it should be inferred that the water was taken for other purposes, the obvious one being crop irrigation.

Consideration

70This reasoning, and the conclusion, are flawed. Her Honour's construction of s 52 does not find any support in the clear words of the section. The provision imposes no limit on the quantity of water that may be taken for domestic or stock purposes. The limitation - the sole limitation - imposed by s 52 is as to the use to which the water taken under the section may be put. There is little doubt that the provision confers variable rights on landholders, depending on the circumstances of their properties and their stock holdings. The reasoning of her Honour would also apply to landholders who had large dams; those who had voluminous tanks or other storage facilities; and to those who had high numbers of stock. No doubt s 52 was drafted in recognition that the rights it conferred would be exercised by landholders with existing infrastructure, and by those who continued to develop and improve their properties. Provided the water taken was used for domestic or stock purposes, s 52 imposes no limit on the volume thereby taken. The restriction imposed in para [97] is artificial, and outside the language of the section.

71In any event, s 52(1)(b) expressly permits the construction and use of a ""water supply work"" for the purpose of taking water. The main channel comes within the definition of ""water supply work"". The main channel was necessary to enable the water to be conveyed to the house dam. Without using the main channel to convey the water to the house dam, the appellant would have been unable to exercise his s 52 ""domestic and stock rights"". Her Honour noted, but appears to have rejected, a submission made on behalf of the appellant, that:

""Whenever anything is authorized, and especially if, as matter of duty, required to be done by law, and it is found impossible to do that thing unless something else not authorized in express terms be also done, then that something else will be supplied by necessary intendment."": Transport Workers' Union of New South Wales v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2008] FCAFC 26; 166 FCR 108

72The erroneous construction of s 52 was one of the factors, but not the only factor, that led her Honour to conclude that the appellant committed the offence for financial gain. It remains to be seen, however, what effect (if any) the erroneous conclusion had on the outcome of the proceedings. 

73Since the appellant had a right to take unmetered water for s 52 purposes, it could not be concluded that the mere fact that he took water in excess of that that could be stored in the house dam was an indicator that he did so for financial gain. That is not to say, however, that taking water in excess of what could reasonably be used for domestic or stock purposes could not be used to provide the basis for an inference that the water was taken for other, illegitimate, purposes. Much depends on the circumstances. Here, it was uncontested that, even though the house dam's capacity was limited to 2-3 megalitres, it was necessary to take vastly more than that quantity in order for the appellant to exercise his s 52 rights.

74There were other reasons given by the judge for reaching the conclusion that the offence was committed for financial gain. These were the six matters set out above: [62]. It is necessary to consider whether these six matters, with or without the erroneous construction of s 52, could sustain the conclusion as to the appellant's motivation in committing the offence - bearing in mind (as her Honour did) that an aggravating feature must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.

75Two of the six matters concerned the admissions made by the appellant in the first and second interviews to the effect that, on other occasions, water from the main channel could have been, or had been, used for irrigation purposes. The answer in the first interview was unequivocal, and related expressly to water pumped while the meter was disabled. On examination, however, the answer in the second interview was not unequivocal; it was given in a general context of questions concerning water contained in the main channel, not necessarily sourced via an unmetered pump.

76Also considered relevant was an answer given by the appellant in cross-examination, acknowledging that he acted as he did in order to exercise his s 52 rights, and that, had he chosen to do so, he could have used another (metered) pump. In my opinion, this answer could not properly be used to support the inference that the offence was committed for financial gain. True it is that the appellant could have used another pump, which would have metered the water taken, for which he then would have been liable to pay. That would have been an exercise of his rights under WAL 8309, and would have been recorded as part of his licence allocation. It would also have incurred a charge. But the appellant was entitled, without metering or charge, to take water for s 52 purposes. It can hardly be said that avoiding a payment he was not obliged to make was obtaining a financial gain.

77Also relevant in the equation was the fact that the appellant had planted a wheat crop. That is a circumstance that might indicate a need for water. However, it was linked to the fact that the appellant had ordered a quantity of water which had not arrived. The fact that water had been ordered specifically for the wheat crop does not support a conclusion that the appellant took unmetered water for that purpose and therefore to avoid payment of water he would have otherwise have had to make; it points in the opposite direction. There was no evidence to indicate when the appellant needed that water, and no evidence when it was expected to be made available.

78The final circumstance taken into account in this conclusion was that only a small proportion of the water taken was capable of being used for domestic consumption. On its own, that may be a circumstance providing the basis for an inference that the purpose of taking the water was other than for domestic or stock use. However, it ignores the appellant's explanation that, in order to deliver the 2 to 3 megalitres into the house dam, it was necessary to take more water to provide the gravitational force required. He said that, by 10.00am on 22 July, the water was only beginning to reach the house dam. 

79In my opinion, the admissions made in the second interview could not be used to support a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the meter tampering offence on 21 July was to enable the appellant to take water for which he ought to have paid, and was therefore committed for financial gain. Nor could the answer given in cross-examination in which the appellant asserted his s 52 rights; far from supporting that conclusion, it indicates to the contrary. The evidence concerning the wheat crop is no more than neutral, in the absence of other evidence to demonstrate the need for water before that which had been ordered became available. The very fact that water had been ordered points in the opposite direction. 

80The conclusion (beyond reasonable doubt) that the offence was committed for financial gain is unsustainable. That was a significant feature in the assessment of objective seriousness. 

81Grounds 12, 13 and 14 concern what might be called subsidiary findings with respect to objective gravity - that is (i) that actual environmental harm was caused by the commission of the offence, (ii) that there was harm or damage to the regulatory system caused by the offence, and (iii) that the offence upset the equitable sharing system in place under the WM Act. Essentially, these grounds assert that the judge treated the offence, not as one of tampering with a meter, but of taking water unlawfully. I think there is merit in these grounds. It is true that it is almost impossible to disentangle the offence of tampering with the meter from its consequences in the taking of unmetered water. The seriousness of those consequences depends upon the extent (if any) to which the appellant in fact used the water for irrigation rather than for domestic or stock purposes. Actual environmental harm cannot be caused by a mere intention to do something, whether lawful or unlawful. Nor can the equitable sharing system be upset by an intention to do something unlawful. These consequences, if they existed, would have resulted from an offence different from that with which the appellant was charged. What he in fact did with the water formed no part of the prosecution case. Pepper J was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to use the bulk of the water for irrigation. For reasons I have given, that conclusion is unsustainable on the evidence. Even if sustained, it does not have the consequences found.

82Moreover, to treat the consequences of the offence as including the unlawful taking of water comes dangerously close to contravening the rule in The Queen v de Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383. I accept, as was pointed out by senior counsel for the respondent, that any additional offence that might be applicable such as, for example, offences against s 91A (unauthorised taking of water), s 91B (unauthorised use of a water supply work) and s 91H (failure to install or maintain metering equipment as required) are all ""Tier 2"" offences, and therefore of lesser gravity than a s 91K offence, and not strictly within the de Simoni principle. However, care must be taken to ensure that an offender is not punished for an offence which is not charged. 

83If it be accepted that the appellant was entitled to take the quantity of water he did for s 52 purposes, there can be no environmental harm caused by an offence that facilitated the exercise of that right. Similarly, there could be no harm or damage to the regulatory system, since the water taken was within the bounds of that system. The same applies to the finding that the offence upset the equitable sharing system.

84Grounds 2 and 3 of the Notice of Appeal complain that, in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, and in considering circumstances of aggravation, the judge failed to take into account the concession made by the respondent that there was no obligation on the appellant to install or use a meter on the pump.

85I consider these grounds of appeal also to have been made out. To disable a pump required by law to be installed and operational is, in my opinion, a more serious offence than disabling a pump which is not so required. 

86It is reasonably clear that the overall scheme of water administration requires the installation and use of meters on pumps used to extract water pursuant to various licences for which the WM Act provides. Interference with the operation of a meter installed for that purpose would be a serious offence. In my opinion, the fact that the meter the subject of the offence was not required to be installed is a significant matter of mitigation. 

87Further complaint was made (ground 15) that the judge, in assessing objective gravity, took into account that there was a water shortage at the time. The complaint was that, since s 364A(1)(g) of the WM Act specifies that there was a ""severe water shortage"", then the fact that there is a mere ""water shortage"" is irrelevant. In my opinion this ground should be considered along with those concerning environmental and other harm. That there is a water shortage has no bearing on the offence of tampering with a meter; it might be different if the offence were of taking water unlawfully.

88The classification of an offence against s 91K as a Tier 1 penalty offence, the magnitude of the monetary penalty provided, and the possible term of imprisonment prescribed are indicative of the seriousness with which the legislature regards the water management scheme. Other Tier 1 penalty offences are the intentional or reckless unauthorised taking of water (eg s 60A(1) and (3)) and the intentional or reckless taking of water for which there is an insufficient allocation (eg s 60C(1) and (3)).

89The purpose of s 91K is, it seems to me, to ensure the maintenance of the integrity of the water management scheme, which would be seriously compromised if meters required to be installed were interfered with in order to bypass the arrangements for the equitable sharing of water. It was no doubt considered that, in the ordinary case, deliberate (intentional or reckless) interference with a meter would be done with the intention and the consequence of bypassing those arrangements. That, in my opinion, explains the classification of the offence as a Tier 1 penalty offence.

90In this case, as I have concluded, the evidence could not establish beyond reasonable doubt either that intention or that consequence.

91It is of interest that, even in the face of her conclusion that the appellant acted with that intention (and that, if undiscovered, his actions would have had that consequence), Pepper J still judged the offence to be one of low objective gravity. Her assessment that the starting point for the monetary penalty should be $40,000 reflected that assessment. That is just over 3.6 per cent of the maximum penalty. Nevertheless, the assessment took into account impermissible aggravating circumstances that must have affected the end result.

92A matter that was not drawn to her Honour's attention, and a significant matter, is that the offence could have been prosecuted in the Local Court, where the maximum applicable monetary penalty was $22,000. It is well established that that may be a relevant sentencing consideration: R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297; R v Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317; 50 NSWLR 115.

93In Doan, Grove J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreed, observed that the fact that an offence could have been dealt with in a court with a lower jurisdictional limit is an available circumstances to be taken into account; the significance of the circumstance varies from case to case (at [42]).

94In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed, considered in detail a number of relevant authorities. His Honour first observed (at [83]) that it was difficult to see how the possibility of summary disposal (in a court with more confined jurisdiction) came within the rare category of cases in which this Court would allow a point not taken at first instance to succeed (cf Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), s 4). His Honour said:

""109 Unless this Court is able to clearly determine that the offence in question, committed by the particular offender with his or her criminal history, ought to have remained in the Local Court, then the argument is theoretical at best. The bare theoretical possibility of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court does not suffice ...

...

111 The ground of appeal can only be meaningful if this Court determines that the total sentence for the particular offence should not have exceeded the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court ...

112 Unless it is plainly wrong that the offence is in the District Court [read Land and Environment Court], it is difficult to see how an offender can succeed on a ground of appeal which claims that a relevant factor has not been taken into account by the sentencing Judge."" (italics added)

95In this case, senior counsel for the respondent argued that it was legitimate to bring the proceedings in the Land and Environment Court because s 91K had not been the subject of prior judicial consideration at the level of a superior court. It was, he contended, desirable that a superior court rule upon the issues raised. That may be so, but it exposed the appellant to a maximum penalty 50 times that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. 

96Given the known circumstances of the offence, and the assessment of the offence as one of low objective gravity, her Honour's attention should have been drawn to the fact that the offence could have been prosecuted in the Local Court, and to the maximum penalty there available. 

97Notwithstanding the respondent's desire to have some parameters established by a superior court, this was an offence that should have been treated as one suitable to be prosecuted in the Local Court, with its limitation on penalty. It is a pity that neither counsel thought to inform her Honour of these circumstances.

98I am satisfied that the total sentence imposed ought not to have exceeded the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court, $22,000. While I consider that the respondent's reasons for bringing the prosecution in the Land and Environment Court, to establish some principles and benchmarks with respect to offences against s 91K, were legitimate, I also consider that the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court ought to have been regarded as a highly significant sentencing factor.

99In the circumstances of this case, I would not prevent the appellant from advancing this circumstance as relevant to the issues before this Court. 

100Moreover, in considering the appropriate penalty, it was legitimate to take into account the associated costs order and publication order. Although she had no way of knowing at what amount the costs would be assessed, Pepper J recognised that it would be substantial. This Court was told by senior counsel for the respondent that the costs it would seek to recover were $75,000. Whether such an amount would be ordered after assessment is not known, but there was never any doubt that they would be substantial. 

101In view of the finding (with which I agree) that the offence was one of low objective gravity, together with the costs order, I am of the view that the offence was one that ought to be dealt with pursuant to s 9 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.

102That brings me to a consideration of the costs order. Much of the time taken up in the Land and Environment Court proceeding was devoted to one issue (the applicability of s 52) on which the respondent failed at first instance; another part of it was devoted to an issue (the appellant's motive in committing the offence) which the respondent has, after appeal, failed to prove to the requisite standard. Mr Simpson's evidence was directed to an attempt (unsuccessful at first instance) to prove that the offence was committed at a time of severe water shortage. For that reason, the appellant should not be liable to pay the entire costs of the proceedings. In any event, any costs for which the respondent is liable should be assessed on the basis that the proceedings were brought in the Local Court and should exclude so much of the hearing time, and preparation, as was taken up with those issues.

103However, there is a further important consideration. The appellant has had a very significant measure of success in this appeal. By s 17(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, he is not entitled to recover any costs of the appeal. In my opinion, that circumstance warrants setting aside the costs order made by the Land and Environment Court.

The publication order

104The final matter for consideration is the publication order. It was in respect of this order that a jurisdictional issue arose. It is the respondent's contention that this Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with an appeal against that order. 

The jurisdiction of this Court

105The publication order was made under s 353G(1)(a) of the WM Act. Section 353G appears in Ch 7 thereof. Chapter 7 is entitled ""Enforcement"". Parts 1 and 2 of Ch 7 set out a wide range of enforcement actions that may be taken by the Minister or authorised officers. Part 3 creates a series of offences. Part 3A, in which s 353G appears, is headed ""Court orders in connection with offences"". The following provisions are relevant:

""353 Operation of Part
(1) This Part applies where a court finds a person guilty of an offence against this Act.
(2) ...

353A Orders generally
(1) One or more orders may be made under this Part against the offender.

(2) Orders may be made under this Part in addition to any penalty that may be imposed or any other action that may be taken in relation to the offence.

353G Additional orders
(1) The court may do any one or more of the following: 
(a) it may order the offender to take specified action to publicise the offence (including the circumstances of the offence) and its environmental and other consequences and any other orders made against the offender,
(b) it may order the offender to carry out, or contribute a specified amount to the cost of carrying out, a specified project for the restoration or enhancement of the environment in a public place or for the public benefit,
(c) it may order the offender to attend, or cause an employee or employees or a contractor or contractors of the offender to attend, a training or other course specified by the court.

(2) The Local Court is not authorised to make an order referred to in subsection (1)(b) or (c).

(3) The court may, in an order under this section, fix a period for compliance and impose any other requirements the court considers necessary or expedient for enforcement of the order.

(4) If the offender fails to comply with an order under subsection (1)(a), the prosecutor or a person authorised by the prosecutor may take action to carry out the order.

(5) The reasonable cost of taking action referred to in subsection (4) is recoverable by the prosecutor or person taking the action, in a court of competent jurisdiction, as a debt from the offender.""

106I have mentioned above that proceedings for offences against the WM Act are to be disposed of summarily, either in the Local Court or in the Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction (s 364). An appeal from a decision of the Land and Environment Court is brought under s 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act, which permits a person convicted of an offence in the summary jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court to appeal to this Court under s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act. It is s 5AA that spells out the parameters of the appeal. Relevantly, s 5AA provides:

""5AA Appeal in criminal cases dealt with by Supreme Court or District Court in their summary jurisdiction
(1) A person: 
(a) convicted of an offence, or
(b) against whom an order to pay any costs is made, or whose application for an order for costs is dismissed, or
(c) in whose favour an order for costs is made,
by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction may appeal under this Act to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the conviction (including any sentence imposed) or order.

...

(4) The Court of Criminal Appeal, in proceedings before it on an appeal under this section, may confirm the determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction or may order that the determination made by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction be vacated and make any determination that the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction could have made on the evidence heard on appeal.

...""

Section 5AB provides:

""5AB Appeal in criminal cases dealt with by Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction
Section 5AA applies to and in respect of a person: 
(a) convicted of an offence, or
(b) against whom an order to pay costs is made, or whose application for an order for costs is dismissed, or
(c) in whose favour an order for costs is made,
by the Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction in the same way as it applies to a person referred to in section 5AA(1), and, for the purposes of this section, a reference in section 5AA to the Supreme Court shall be read and construed as a reference to the Land and Environment Court.""

107The respondent's contention is that an order under Ch 7 Pt 3A is not a ""sentence"" within the meaning of s 5AA(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, and is therefore not subject to appeal to this Court. Two bases were advanced for this proposition. The first is the terms of s 353A(2):

""Orders may be made under this Part ... in addition to any penalty that may be imposed ..."" (italics added)

108It may at once be acknowledged that there is some apparent force in this submission. The language of sub-s (2) does indeed support the proposition that an order under Pt 3A is not a penalty. It would be otherwise if the language used were ""in addition to any other penalty"". I will return to this.

109The second reason advanced by the respondent invokes the definition of ""sentence"" for the purposes of the Criminal Appeal Act, contained in s 2 thereof. In order to deal with the argument, it is necessary to set out the whole of the lengthy definition:

""Sentence means: 
(a) any order made by the court of trial on convicting a person of an offence, including: 
(i) any sentence of imprisonment (including any sentence of imprisonment the subject of an intensive correction order or home detention order and any sentence of imprisonment whose execution is suspended), and
(ii) any community service order, and
(iii) any good behaviour bond, and
(iv) any fine,
imposed under Part 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, or

(b) any order made by the court of trial in respect of a person under section 10 or 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on finding the person guilty of an offence, or

(c) any order made by the court of trial in respect of a person under section 12 or 17A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on convicting the person of an offence, or

(ca) any order made by the court of trial, after a person's conviction for an offence, revoking a good behaviour bond and any order made by the court of trial as a consequence of the revocation of the good behaviour bond, or

(d) any order made by the court of trial imposing a limiting term of imprisonment on a person under section 23(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, and any other order or penalty made or imposed by the court of trial in respect of the person under section 23 (2) of that Act, or

(e) any order made by the court of trial in respect of a person under section 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, or

(f) any direction for compensation made by the court of trial in respect of a person under section 94 (Directions for compensation for injury) or 97 (Directions for compensation for loss) of the Victims Rights and Support Act 2013, or

(g) any order for restitution made by the court of trial in respect of a person under section 43 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, or

(h) any order for the payment of costs made by the court of trial in respect of a person under Division 3 of Part 5 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, or

(i) any child protection registration order made under section 3D of the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000, or

(j) (Repealed)

and the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to pass any such sentence includes power to make any such order or direction.""

110The respondent's contention was that the publication order does not come within any sub-paragraph of the definition. Accordingly, so the argument ran, the publication order was not a ""sentence"" within s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act, and not susceptible of appeal under that provision. The appellant's response was to rely on the words ""or order"" in the concluding part of s 5AA(1). The respondent countered - correctly, in my opinion - by arguing that, in its context, ""order"" can only mean a costs order of the kind referred in s 5AA(1)(b) and (c).

111There are three fundamental flaws in the respondent's argument, any of which would be fatal. 

112The first, and most simply exposed, flaw lies in overlooking the opening words of the definition of ""sentence"". A ""sentence"" is ""any order made by the court of trial on convicting a person of an offence"". The definition could stop there. The detailed individual subparagraphs that follow are illustrative of the kinds of orders that are included. They do not mark out the boundaries of the definition. The publication order was ""an order made by the court of trial on convicting [the appellant] of the offence"". It is therefore a ""sentence"" (or a component of a sentence) within s 5AA.

113There are cases that suggest that the use of the word ""includes"" (or ""including"") in a definitional provision may import an ""exhaustive explanation of the meaning of the word described: see, for example, Dilworth v Commissioner of Stamps [1899] AC 99; YZ Finance Co Pty Ltd v Cummings [1964] HCA 12; 109 CLR 395.

114This is not such a case. Section 2 of the Criminal Appeal Act contains, in the opening words, a complete definition, which incorporates all the orders that are mentioned, by way of example, in the subparagraphs that follow.

115The second flaw in the argument is this. While it is correct to say that the publication order does not come within any sub-paragraph of the s 2 definition of ""sentence"", it is equally true that the order imposing the fine of $28,000 does not come within any sub-paragraph of that definition. If the respondent's argument were accepted, the fine also would not be a ""sentence"" within s 5AA. Yet the respondent does not challenge the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain an appeal against that order. Nor, in the light of s 5AB and s 5AA, could he realistically do so. Section 5AA expressly confers a right of appeal against a costs order and a costs order comes within para (h) of the definition of ""sentence"" in s 2 of the Criminal Appeal Act. There is therefore no question that the costs order is subject to appeal to this Court. But the respondent's argument in relation to the publication order applies squarely to the order imposing the fine. If the respondent's contention were accepted, the only appeal open to the appellant would be against the costs order. That was manifestly not the intention of the legislature. 

116On behalf of the respondent, reference was made to a number of decisions of the High Court and this Court concerning the definition of ""sentence"" in the Criminal Appeal Act, and orders that have been held to come within that definition or not come within it. Reference was made to Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293; R v Carngham [1978] HCA 48; 140 CLR 487; R v Kakura (1990) 20 NSWLR 638; and Wise v R [2006] NSWCCA 264.

117In Griffiths, it was held that an order deferring sentence for a lengthy period conditional upon entry into a good behaviour bond was not a ""sentence"" within the meaning of the term as used in the Criminal Appeal Act. In Carngham, it was held that an order for release, associated with the imposition of a term of imprisonment (pursuant to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)) was an integral part of a ""sentence"" for the purposes of the Criminal Appeal Act. In Kakura this Court held that an order for forfeiture of property not that of the offender was not a sentence for the purposes of the Criminal Appeal Act. One difficulty with each of these is that the definition in s 2 then in force was in very different terms to the definition as it now stands. Of the cases cited, it is only Wise that was decided under the definition in its current form. There is nothing in that decision that assists in determining the present question. The authorities referred to on behalf of the respondent do not support his position.

118The third flaw in the argument is that a publication order, while not a penalty, is intended to be remedial and even educative, rather than punitive, and to have a deterrent effect. It is also undoubtedly ""an order made by a court ... on convicting a person of an offence"". While a publication order is not (or may not be) a penalty, in that respect it is not to be distinguished from other of the orders mentioned in the catalogue of orders that follow the opening words of the definition.

119That brings me back to the terms of s 353A(2). In Carngham (in which the High Court held that an order for release was inseverable (for appellate purposes) from a sentence of imprisonment), Gibbs ACJ said:

""[9] If it were thought that doubt remained on this point, it would be permissible, in construing the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act, to resolve the ambiguity by adopting a construction that would avoid absurdity and injustice. It would in my opinion be absurd, and in some cases unjust, if the Court of Criminal Appeal, whether on an appeal by the convicted person or on an appeal by the Crown, had power to quash a sentence of imprisonment, and to pass another sentence in substitution therefor, but had no power to affect an order that the person convicted be released after serving portion of the sentence originally imposed. It seems to me that it must have been intended by the legislature that if the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a sentence the result would be to put an end to any order that the person convicted be released after he had served portion of that sentence. In other words the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to pass a new sentence of imprisonment, whether more or less severe, was not intended to be fettered, or rendered futile by the continued operation of an order for release after the sentence in conjunction with which it was imposed had been quashed.""

120In this case, it would be more than absurd to adopt a construction of ""sentence"" in s 5AA(1) that effectively eliminated the appeal the legislature manifestly intended to be available to a person convicted and penalised in the Land and Environment Court. It would thwart the legislative intent. 

121That the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal on re-sentencing was not intended to be fettered in the way for which the respondent contended is confirmed by the concluding words of the definition of sentence: ""and the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to pass any such sentence includes power to make any such order or direction."". That means that in the case of a sentence appeal brought by the respondent under s 5D, for example, which empowers the Court of Criminal Appeal to impose ""such sentence as to it may seem proper"", that includes the power to impose a publication order under s 353A(2) which had been refused by the Land and Environment Court.

122The starting point for the construction of s 353A(2) is that this provision, too, must be construed with a view to avoiding not only absurdity, but also injustice. There are, as senior counsel for the respondent recognised, potential practical difficulties should an appeal against the fine be allowed and the fine imposed at first instance reduced or varied. 

123The publication order made by Pepper J was very specific in its terms, and required the appellant to publish locally that he had been fined $28,000 and ordered to pay the respondent's costs as agreed or assessed. Should my views expressed above prevail in this Court, that would be simply factually wrong. The respondent's position is untenable. It must be open to this Court to vary orders made that are closely associated with the order recognised to be a sentence. The respondent sought to deal with this by submitting:

""89 If the Court interfered with the amount of penalty imposed or the costs as assessed or agreed order, the respondent would not object to the applicant including such variations in any publication order.""

124No basis was advanced on which the parties could, between themselves, agree to depart from an order of the Land and Environment Court that the respondent claims is binding and beyond the supervision of this Court. If this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the publication order, it lacks jurisdiction to order or even authorise a variation of the terms of the publication order. 

125There is an even more absurd, and unjust, potential consequence of the respondent's position. There will, no doubt, be cases in which a person is convicted in the Land and Environment Court and the conviction overturned on appeal. What of such a case where a publication order had been made? On the respondent's construction of s 353A, the person convicted (and subsequently acquitted) would be required to publish a patently false notice, and one highly damaging to his/her reputation. On that argument, this Court would have no jurisdiction to interfere with the order.

126It is also material to remember that these proceedings were Class 5 proceedings in the Land and Environment Court. Section 56 of the Land and Environment Court Act provides as follows:

""56 Nature of decision of the Court
Except as provided: 
(a) by Division 2, in relation to proceedings in Class 1, 2, 3, 4 or 8 of the Court's jurisdiction, or
(b) by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, in relation to proceedings in Class 5, 6 or 7 of the Court's jurisdiction,
a decision of the Court shall be final and conclusive.""

In other words, the only appeal in relation to Class 5 proceedings is that provided by the Criminal Appeal Act. Even where a conviction is set aside, if the respondent's argument were accepted, the publication order would stand. 

127Orders under s 353A may only be made on conviction. The avoidance of absurdity and of injustice demands that s 353A(2) be read as though the word ""other"" appeared before ""penalty"". In my opinion this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the publication order. 

128The provision for publication orders has, in my opinion, a significant educative and deterrent function. It is important that others who may be minded to commit offences against the WM Act be made aware of the possible consequences of such offences. On behalf of the appellant it was argued that the publication order ought to be set aside, primarily because the offence was ""trivial"" or ""technical"". I do not accept these descriptions. However, the publication order in the terms specified by Pepper J cannot stand, in the light of what I have said above. In my opinion, it will be sufficient to order the appellant to publish, in one locally circulating newspaper, a notice drawing attention to the plea of guilty, the conviction, and the maximum fine available. It is not necessary to identify the appellant. The terms of the notice I propose are attached.

129Section 5AA(4) and s 5AB of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that this Court may vacate any determination of the Land and Environment Court and make any determination that was available to that Court.

130I propose the following orders:

(1)Appeal allowed.

(2)Order (1) of the Orders made by the Land and Environment Court (by which the appellant was convicted of the offence against s 91K(1) of the Water Management Act 2000 (NSW)), is confirmed.

(3)Orders (2)-(7) made by the Land and Environment Court are vacated. In lieu thereof, the following determinations are made:

(a)direct, pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), that Ronald Norman Harris enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 2 years;

(b)order, pursuant to s 353G(1)(a) of the Water Management Act 2000, that Ronald Norman Harris, within 28 days of the date of this judgment, at his own expense, publish in either the Riverine Grazier or The Land, a notice in the form attached as Annexure ""A"" to these orders.

131HALL J: I agree with Simpson J.

132SCHMIDT J: I agree with Simpson J.

**********
Annexure “A”
 
By s 91K of the Water Management Act 2000 (NSW) it is an offence to tamper with water metering equipment installed in connection with, among other things, a pump constructed or used for the purpose of taking river water.  Such an offence incurs heavy penalties.  Where committed by an individual, the fine can be as high as $1,100,000.
 
In July 2009, a local farmer and grazier inserted a steel rod into a pump that was used to take water from the Murrumbidgee.  The steel rod prevented the meter from operating and recording the volume of water taken.  Although the offender claimed that he took this action only for the purpose of filling his house dam, which he was entitled to do, the interference with the meter was still an offence.  He was prosecuted in the Land and Environment Court, where he pleaded guilty and has been convicted.
 
All water users should be aware of the serious consequences of offences against the Water Management Act, including meter tampering.

2763910,Bland v R [2014] NSWCCA 82,"Judgment

1WARD JA: I agree with Johnson J.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Robert Joseph Bland, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Black QC at the Lismore District Court on 8 June 2012. 

The Offences and Sentences

3The Applicant pleaded guilty to:

(a) an offence of aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years, contrary to s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900, punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment with a specified standard non-parole period of eight years;

(b) an offence of attempt to choke a person with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely detaining a person for advantage without consent, contrary to s.37 Crimes Act 1900, punishable by a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment.

4At the request of the Applicant, the sentencing Judge took into account, in passing sentence for the offence under s.37 Crimes Act 1900, the following offences by way of a Form 1:

(a) aggravated enter dwelling with intent to indecently assault, an offence under s.111(2) Crimes Act 1900 which, if prosecuted separately, is punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment;

(b) an offence of aggravated detain for advantage involving the infliction of actual bodily harm contrary to s.86(2)(b) Crimes Act 1900 which, if prosecuted separately, is punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment.

5With respect to the s.61M(2) offence, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years and nine months commencing on 7 June 2012 and expiring on 6 March 2016 with a balance of term of one year and three months commencing on 7 March 2016 and expiring on 6 June 2017. 

6With respect to the s.37 offence, and taking into account the two offences on the Form 1, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years commencing on 7 June 2014 and expiring on 6 June 2018, with a balance of term of four years commencing on 7 June 2018 and expiring on 6 June 2022. 

7The total effective sentence comprised a non-parole period of six years expiring on 6 June 2018, with a balance of term of four years expiring on 6 June 2022. 

Grounds of Appeal

8The Applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a) Ground 1 - The sentencing Judge erred in failing to apply the principles enunciated in Pearce v The Queen to properly determine an appropriate sentence for each offence before addressing the accumulation of sentences.

(b) Ground 2 - The sentencing Judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the totality principle in his accumulation of sentences.

(c) Ground 3 - The sentencing Judge erred in failing to give appropriate weight to the subjective case of the Applicant. 

(d) Ground 4 - The sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account the time served on bail by the Applicant, given the restrictive nature of the bail conditions.

(e) Ground 5 - The sentence is manifestly excessive.

(f) Ground 6 - The sentencing Judge erred by failing to assess the objective seriousness of each of the offences.

(g) Ground 7 - The sentencing Judge erred in the application of s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in respect of Count 1, by failing to give a full statement of reasons for the specification of a non-parole period lower than the standard non-parole period.

(h) Ground 8 - Abandoned.

(i) Ground 9 - Fresh evidence establishes that the sentencing proceedings have given rise to a miscarriage of justice.

9Before moving to the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to refer to the facts of the offences. 

Facts of the Offences

10A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. What follows is drawn from that statement.

11The Applicant was a friend of the victim's older brother and had visited the victim's home, including staying there overnight on occasions. At the time of the offences, the Applicant was 20 years of age and the victim was 15 years of age. 

12The victim resided with his father in a street-level townhouse in a town in northern New South Wales.

Offence 1 Form 1 - Aggravated Enter Dwelling House with Intent to Indecently Assault

13On the morning of 7 February 2011, the victim was asleep in his bedroom. His father had left home at 5.20 am to go to work. There was no one else at home apart from the victim.

14About an hour after the victim's father had left for work, the Applicant entered the residence, probably through an unlocked sliding door leading into the main bedroom. The Applicant went to the bedroom of the sleeping victim. 

15The Applicant placed a cloth bag over the victim's head, tying it at the front. The victim awoke and, unable to see clearly through the bag, observed a shadowy figure leaning over him. The Applicant then straddled the victim, who was lying facing the ceiling. The Applicant pinned the victim's arms to the bed and, in doing so, bruised the victim's right arm. The victim stated that he thought he was dreaming at this point. 

16The victim's hands were tied separately to the bed with a business tie and a leather belt. The victim asked, ""What are you doing?"" but the Applicant did not reply. The victim started to struggle. 
 
Count 1 - Aggravated Indecent Assault

17The Applicant then removed the victim's boxer shorts and put his hands on the victim's penis and masturbated him for approximately 10 seconds. The victim said to the Applicant, ""Get off me"". Again, there was no reply. 

18The victim managed to free his right hand of the leather belt and attempted to use his free hand to defend himself. The Applicant said, ""Stop defending yourself"". 

19The Applicant then slapped the victim around the face and head, causing bruising to his right cheek and swelling to three areas near the top of his head. The victim did not hit the Applicant as he was disorientated and feared that this would provoke his assailant further.

Count 2 - Attempt to Choke with Intent to Commit an Indictable Offence; Offence 2 Form 1 - Aggravated Detain for Advantage with Infliction of Actual Bodily Harm

20The Applicant then placed one hand over the victim's mouth and used the other to block his nose. The victim could not breathe and struggled, moving his head to free his mouth and nose from the Applicant's hands.

21The Applicant then placed both hands around the victim's neck and pressed on to his throat. The victim was unable to breathe and almost passed out. At some point, the Applicant loosened his grip on the victim's throat, and the victim was able to push the Applicant's hands away from his neck. 

22The victim called out for help and the Applicant leaned forward and closed the windows to the victim's bedroom. 

23The Applicant then grabbed the victim's right hand and attempted to tie it back to the bed rail with the belt. The victim managed to free his hand of the Applicant's grip and rolled over so that he was facing the mattress. 

24The Applicant then put his arm around the victim's neck, placing pressure on the victim's throat. The victim feared that the Applicant was attempting to strangle him.

25As he did this, the Applicant continued to slap and punch the victim to the top of his head a number of times. The victim bit the Applicant's hand. The Applicant quickly took his arm from around the victim's neck, causing one of the victim's teeth to become loose. 

26The victim heard the sound of a zip being opened. Fearing sexual assault by way of penile/anal intercourse, the victim moved his body quickly around the bed, causing the Applicant to fall off. The victim's left hand was still tied to the bed railing by the tie. 

The Victim Calls for Assistance and the Police Arrive

27The Applicant then told the victim to stay where he was or he would be harmed. The victim heard the Applicant leave and immediately removed the bag from his head and dialled ""000"". The call was recorded at 6.27 am. 

28After making the ""000"" call, the victim freed his left hand from the bed railing. Arming himself with a metal bar, he left his bedroom and locked the front door of the premises whilst waiting for the police to arrive.

29At 6.40 am, the police attended the premises and spoke with the victim. Ambulance officers attended the address and the victim was taken to a nearby hospital where he was medically examined.

30At 1.31 pm on that day, the victim attended the police station and participated in a recorded interview. He told police that his assailant had ""put on a deep voice"", which he considered to be ""deep and fake"". The victim indicated to police that the voice reminded him of the Applicant's voice.

Police Investigation and Arrest of Applicant

31At 4.30 pm that day, police attended the Applicant's home and spoke to him. The Applicant made no admission concerning the offences.

32The Applicant told police that he once owned a white belt similar to the one used to tie the victim, but that he had left the belt at an ""op shop"" some six months earlier. The Applicant also stated that he owned similar business ties to the one used to tie the victim to the bed, but that he was not missing any. The Applicant also told police that he owned part of a tan female stocking which he used to cover his hair when he was wearing female wigs, and that he may have left a similar stocking at the victim's home in early 2010. 

33The Applicant told police that his mother had dropped him in town between 5.30 am and 6.00 am that morning and that he had walked past the victim's home and noticed a light on. 

34The Applicant provided a voluntary buccal swab to police.

35A number of items located at the crime scene at the victim's home, including the white leather belt, blue business tie and tan stocking, were sent to the Division of Analytical Laboratories for examination. A DNA profile consistent with the Applicant's DNA profile was located on the belt and stocking. DNA profiles consistent with the Applicant and the victim were found on the tie. 

36CCTV footage obtained clearly showed the Applicant walking past a shop approximately 50 metres from the victim's home at 6.28 am on 7 February 2011, with the Applicant wearing blue jeans and a blue-striped hooded jumper and carrying a black backpack. Located at the Applicant's home on the afternoon of 7 February 2011 was a black backpack which contained some clothing items together with a yellow rope, two long-sleeved gloves and numerous sealed condoms and lubricant.

37The Applicant was arrested and charged on 17 February 2011. He was granted conditional bail on 18 February 2011 and remained on bail until sentence was passed on 8 June 2012.

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

38The Applicant was 20 years of age at the time of the offences and 21 years of age at the time of sentence.

39He has no prior criminal history. 

40Tendered at the sentencing hearing were reports of Dr Stephen Allnutt, psychiatrist, dated 4 June 2012 and Dr Lynette Arnoldus-Lewis, psychologist, dated 25 May 2012. In addition, several character references were tendered in the defence case.

41A short report of Renia Gryc, the Northern Rivers Counselling Co-Ordinator with ACON, dated 30 May 2012, was also tendered in the defence case. 

42A short affidavit of the Applicant affirmed 8 June 2012 was also relied upon in the District Court. In that affidavit, the Applicant indicated his agreement with the Statement of Agreed Facts and expressed regret for the offences. He said that he had consulted with Dr Arnoldus-Lewis on five occasions. He said that he had read the reports of Dr Allnutt and Dr Arnoldus-Lewis and that the histories provided to those practitioners by him were accurate. He stated that he had participated in counselling with Ms Gryc. He indicated his willingness to participate in any program recommended by the psychologist and psychiatrist, the Department of Corrective Services and the Probation and Parole Service.

43The documentary material before the District Court indicated that the Applicant and his older brother resided at the time of these offences with their parents, who had provided the Applicant with a stable and supportive family environment. The Applicant had completed Year 12 at high school and was reported as being an average student. He had no learning problems and no difficulties with teachers.

44At the time of these offences, the Applicant was employed as a bank relief staffer at a bank in Lismore. At the time of sentence, he was unemployed. 

45The Applicant informed his psychologist of his intensive use of an online virtual reality game. The Applicant reported recreational drug and alcohol use, but was not using any substances on a regular basis at the time of the offences. 

46The Applicant informed Dr Arnoldus-Lewis of persistent bullying at school, from the age of eight or nine until he finished high school. The bullying was said to have included references to his homosexuality. Dr Allnutt noted that the Applicant reported bullying at school between Years 4 and 10. The Applicant also reported witnessing an incident when a former boyfriend of his was ""thrown through a plate glass window because he was gay"". In the assessment of Dr Arnoldus-Lewis, this incident compounded the Applicant's chronic ""post-traumatic stress disorder from years of unrelenting abuse"". 

47The psychiatric assessment of Dr Allnutt was that the Applicant did not manifest active symptoms of any major psychiatric condition, but had sexual fantasies of a sadomasochistic nature. The Applicant stated that the offences involved ""the enactment of a fantasy he had had for the prior 2 years"".

48Dr Allnutt said ""his sexual behaviour would be regarded as sexually deviant and raises concern that the underlying drive was a possible underlying paraphilia disorder, namely a sadomasochistic paraphilia, the victim was around 15 years of age thus the behaviour was hebephilic"" (Allnutt report, 4 June 2012, page 7).

49Dr Allnutt undertook a detailed risk assessment by reference to SVR20 and STATIC-99 (pages 8-9). Having regard to both actuarial and clinical assessments, Dr Allnutt considered that the Applicant lay ""in the moderate risk range of future sexual recidivism as compared to other sex offenders"".

50Dr Allnutt considered that the Applicant presented ""as an individual with reasonable prospects for rehabilitation should he pursue a sex offender rehabilitation program and complete it"", with consideration to be given to the prescription of sex-drive suppressant medication after completing such a program and with the benefit of further psychiatric evaluation.

Impact of the Offences Upon the Victim

51A victim impact statement, dated 14 May 2012, was tendered at the sentencing hearing and read to the Court by the victim's father. 

52In that statement, the victim said that before the offences, he was a ""happy, easygoing kid"", but that everything changed after the Applicant, whom he regarded as ""a trusted friend"" of his brother, broke into his home and assaulted him. 

53After the assault, the victim could not go back to the house and his father had organised a new place for them to live. The victim had been experiencing nightmares and flashbacks about the offences, involving a bag being placed over his head. The relationship between the victim and his father had changed. 

54The victim stayed away from school for weeks after the offences. It had been difficult for the victim to concentrate on his schoolwork thereafter. 

55He said that his life was ""completely different"" and that his approach to life had been affected by what he described as a betrayal of trust.

Remarks on Sentence

56The sentencing hearing proceeded on 8 June 2012, with the tender of the various documents identified so far in this judgment and the making of submissions on the question of sentence. There was no oral evidence.

57His Honour proceeded to sentence the Applicant that day by way of ex tempore remarks on sentence. 

58The remarks on sentence were succinct. Given the challenges made by the Applicant before this Court, it is appropriate to refer to aspects of his Honour's remarks. 

59His Honour recited the offences and applicable penalties and the Form 1 matters before summarising the facts of the offences (ROS1-2). His Honour observed that the Form 1 matters, which were ""obviously aspects of the matters in the indictment"", were ""on their own ... serious matters"" (ROS2).

60The sentencing Judge referred to the victim's ""terrifying experience"" and adverted to the victim impact statement (ROS3):

""I do not mean any disrespect to what is in it, it is a very clear and cogent statement, but what I think it is necessary to point out is that it contains exactly the results, fears and terrors that one would expect to arise from an attack of this nature and it is to be hoped that with the passage of time the young man will get better at dealing with it but nobody can suggest he will ever forget it. There was one aspect again which is quite understandable is that the family out of sympathy with the young man had to move home and I can well understand that.""

61The sentencing Judge described the offences as ""very serious"". 

62His Honour then turned to the Applicant's subjective circumstances (ROS3-4):

""First and foremost he has pleaded guilty, he is entitled to full credit for that. It has in particular in a case of this nature saved the young person from having to go through unpleasant details and reliving the experience and also I take it, despite what has been said on other heads, that it is acknowledgement by the offender of having committed these offences and recognising the gravity of them. Now the offender now is aged twenty-one, he was twenty at the time of this. He has no previous convictions so not surprisingly people were concerned to investigate how this sort of behaviour could have come about. In the result there is a report from a Dr Lynette Arnoldus-Lewis dated 25 May 2012, part of exhibit 1. There is a report from Dr Allnutt dated 4 June 2012, also part of exhibit 1. There are in addition some references from people who have known the offender. They speak highly of him and to summarise what they say I think they would be horrified at what has happened because in their experience of him it was totally out of character and I can well understand that."" 

63The sentencing Judge approached the psychiatric and psychological evidence in the following way (ROS4):

""The effect of the medical reports in my view is that there is no specific medical reason by way of mental disability identified. It is acknowledged in the reports that for particular reasons to which I will come he needs extensive counselling and rehabilitation. The background appears to be that because he has entered into by means of the Internet a world sometimes called of parallel reality he was therefore dissociated first of all from real life and, secondly, was living in a form of fantasy world which certainly on one reading of the reports he was not clear whether he had actually fantasised what the facts were in this case or had actually carried them out. Now Dr Arnoldus-Lewis takes that situation, if I can put it in the vernacular, more onboard than does Dr Allnutt and she, that is Dr Arnoldus-Lewis, takes the view that it amounts, coupled with other matters such as bullying in the past and an incident involving a partner, I will call him, of the offender, as amounting to post traumatic stress disorder. Dr Allnutt does not go that far and I give more effect to Dr Allnutt who was aware of Dr Arnoldus-Lewis' conclusions. He records them but he does not adopt them. Their common ground is, as I have said, that significant counselling and rehabilitation is required here and there is no situation here bringing into play in my view the substantial line of authority that where there is a mental issue of significance then the deterrence issue on a personal level takes far less significant place although equally the deterrence issue on a public level might be more accentuated because of the particular attitude of the offender. That really is, as I understood it, what the Crown was saying, they say well you cannot be sure what the future holds here and the protection of the public is an important issue.''

64His Honour then turned to a range of matters which had been addressed in oral submissions (ROS4-5):

""There are two essentially competing issues that compete here, that is the gravity of the offence and therefore the protection of the public and the youth of the offender. I can summarise the particular matters of relevance on the subjective level. They were put forward as Dr Arnoldus-Lewis' report, the bullying in the past, his vulnerability in a custodial situation, that goes together with his youth, and the overall need for rehabilitation. Mention was made of his bail restrictions but it is to be borne in mind that he was on bail to enable him to seek appropriate medical assistance to be put forward as part of his mitigation for these offences. They are all relevant matters and they do in their varying ways in my view amount to special circumstances which I will be finding and I identify in particular the matters giving rise to those. The main ones are the lack of previous record, first custodial sentence, his youth and his vulnerability in a custodial setting.""

65Issues of concurrency, accumulation and totality were then considered (ROS5):

""We then have to come back to looking at the two counts and bearing in mind the Form 1 and looking at an overall sentence and then making allowance for the plea. Now I am not going to descend into mathematics but in looking at a sentence overall in the region of some fourteen years. That means that I will discount the overall sentence to one of ten years and that will be made up in the following way.""

66The sentencing Judge then imposed the sentences on the two counts, noting that a finding of special circumstances had been made. The remarks on sentence concluded in the following way (ROS5-6):

""So that gives an overall sentence, and I have borne in mind the principles of Pearce of ten years and a non parole period of six years which in my view is the absolute minimum I can impose for matters such as this. Those are the sentences I pass. I have taken into account the matters on the Form 1 in respect of count 2.""

Ground 9 - The Fresh Evidence Ground

67It is appropriate to commence with Ground 9, the Applicant's fresh evidence ground. 

68In support of this ground, Ms Francis, counsel for the Applicant, sought to read the affidavit of John Pearson, solicitor, affirmed 26 September 2013 to which was annexed a report dated 9 August 2013 of Dr John Kasinathan, psychiatrist.

69Ms Francis contends that the Court should admit this report as fresh evidence on the leave application.

70The Crown objects to this Court receiving the report of Dr Kasinathan upon the basis that it was brought into existence after the Applicant was sentenced, and does not otherwise satisfy the requirements for receipt of post-sentence evidence on an application for leave to appeal against sentence. 

71To resolve this controversy, it is appropriate to refer to the report of Dr Kasinathan and how it is said to be admissible in this Court. Dr Kasinathan interviewed the Applicant by audio-visual link for one hour on 9 August 2013 for the purpose of preparation of the report. Dr Kasinathan expressed the opinion that the Applicant fell within the psychiatric diagnoses, in accordance with DSM-V, consistent with mild autism spectrum disorder and sexual sadism disorder (in remission, in a controlled environment).

72Dr Kasinathan observed that the Applicant's mild autism spectrum ""may have contributed to Mr Bland's sense of isolation, rigid thinking and poor judgment at the material time"", being the time of the offences (page 7). Whilst agreeing with Dr Allnutt's assessment that the Applicant fell into a moderate-high risk category for future sexual offending from an actuarial viewpoint, Dr Kasinathan opined that the Applicant's risk of future sexual offending was significantly lower when dynamic and treatment variables are taken into account. Dr Kasinathan considered that the Applicant fell into a low-risk category for future sexual offending.

73Dr Kasinathan noted that the psychological report of Dr Arnoldus-Lewis was comprehensive, but stated that her diagnostic impressions of borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder were inaccurate (page 9). 

74With respect to Dr Allnutt's report, Dr Kasinathan stated (page 10):

""The psychiatric report by Dr Stephen Allnutt dated 4 June 2012 was accurate in that no diagnosis of personality disorder was made, as there was none present. The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder was not considered, probably due to the mild nature of its presence in Mr Bland. A possible diagnosis of sexual sadism was considered, which the writer agreed with. Actuarial risk factors were evaluated accurately, however dynamic risk factors were not considered to a great depth. The presence of autism spectrum represented a modifiable psychiatric condition (as illustrated above).""

Decision on Admissibility of Report

75A number of reports were tendered in the Applicant's case at the sentencing hearing in the District Court. These reports included a report from Dr Allnutt, a most experienced forensic psychiatrist. In addition, a report from Dr Arnoldus-Lewis was tendered against the background of several treatment sessions had by that practitioner with the Applicant. 

76The Applicant was sentenced on 8 June 2012 and lodged a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal to this Court on 14 February 2013. Some six months later, the Applicant was assessed by Dr Kasinathan. A report was provided that day which is now sought to be deployed on the application before this Court. 

77From time to time, this Court has considered applications to admit what is said to be fresh evidence on an application for leave to appeal against sentence.

78In Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509, Simpson J (Davies J and Grove AJ agreeing) said at 528 [104]:

""The general principle is that parties to litigation, including criminal litigation, are bound by the manner in which their cases are presented at first instance and will not be permitted to enhance their cases on appeal by producing fresh, or new, evidence: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at p 377. That applies no less to applications for leave to appeal against sentence than it does to conviction appeals.""

79However, Simpson J observed at 528 [105] that the ""rule is far from absolute"". Her Honour adverted to a number of authorities, and then returned to the statutory context governing a sentence appeal. Simpson J said at 529 [109]-[110]:

""109 ... However, with respect to applications for leave to appeal against sentence, there is an additional, sometimes intractable, barrier to admissibility. Jurisdiction of this Court in sentencing matters derives from s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The powers of the Court are spelled out in s 6(3) which is in the following terms: 

'6(3) ... the court, if it is of the opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.'

110 A fundamental pre-condition to the exercise of the power of the Court to quash a sentence and pass another sentence is the formation of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed . In other words, this Court, as a matter of law, cannot interfere with a sentence passed at first instance unless it has identified some error, either in the sentencing process or in the outcome of the sentencing process. That has this additional implication: axiomatically, evidence of events or circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since sentencing cannot be taken into account, no matter how compelling they may be. If the facts did not exist at the time of sentencing, it cannot have been an error for the sentencing judge not to have taken them into account. In those circumstances, the impact on the sentence is a matter for the executive government: R v Munday [1981] 2 NSWLR 177."" 

80These statements by her Honour should be understood as relating to a case where fresh evidence is relied upon as the basis for appellate intervention under ss.5(1)(c) and 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, in circumstances where no other error is established. It is clear that evidence of post-sentence events may be received if error has been established and the Court is considering the question of resentencing under s.6(3): Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284.

81Simpson J referred (at 529-530 [111]-[114]) to the category of cases concerning assistance to the authorities.

82Her Honour then turned to a further ""increasingly common"" category of cases concerning medical evidence, including R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328, R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 and Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1. (There have been further recent examples, including Tran v R [2014] NSWCCA 32 and Grant v R [2014] NSWCCA 67, where similar applications were also rejected).

83As Simpson J made clear, at 530-531 [117]-[121], this Court has emphasised that caution must be exercised in the admission of evidence of this type. It is proper for the Court to examine the circumstances, and any explanation for non-production of evidence at first instance, together with the potential significance of the evidence to have affected the outcome at first instance.

84In the circumstances in Khoury v R, the psychiatric and psychological reports were admitted. There had been no psychiatric or psychological evidence tendered at all at first instance. Further, an affidavit had been sworn by counsel who appeared at first instance bearing upon the question why no such evidence had been tendered.

85Those circumstances are far removed from the present case.

86In R v Fordham, Howie AJ (Hunt CJ at CL and Smart AJ agreeing) stated at 377-378 that, even if the evidence is fresh, it ought not be received by the Court unless it affects the outcome of the case. Generally, it must be shown that the sentencing of the offender, in the absence of the fresh evidence, resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The miscarriage of justice principle in R v Fordham was applied in Norrie v R [2008] NSWCCA 185 at [22].

87Ground 9 is framed in terms which seek to engage the principle in R v Fordham, contending that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.

88The High Court has emphasised recently the importance of the principle of finality in the area of sentencing: Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10; 88 ALJR 490 at 496-497 [14]-[16]. This Court has also stressed that a sentence leave application involves a challenge to a discretionary determination and is not a rehearing of a plea in mitigation or the occasion for the revision or reformulation of the case presented below: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 477-479 [79]-[81]. At the same time, it was recognised that criminal appellate courts should be able to correct a miscarriage of justice or serious injustice in the clear and rare cases where the relevant matter has not been relied upon at first instance: Zreika v R at 478 [82].

89This is not a case, like Khoury v R (at 527 [102]), where there was no psychiatric or psychological evidence adduced on sentence at first instance. Indeed, the psychiatric evidence adduced here was from an eminent forensic psychiatrist, Dr Allnutt, and a treating psychologist, Dr Arnoldus-Lewis. There was an affidavit of the Applicant which confirmed the matters contained in those reports. A thorough and considered approach was taken by the Applicant's then legal representatives on this topic.

90It may be inferred that the legal representatives for the Applicant before this Court have caused a further psychiatric examination to be undertaken by a different psychiatrist with a further report resulting. There is no suggestion that Dr Kasinathan's report has been provided to Dr Allnutt for comment, let alone that Dr Allnutt has revised his opinion in the light of that report. A scenario such as that (if it existed) might bring the case closer to one where the interests of justice warranted the admission of additional evidence before this Court. However, that would be because the psychiatrist relied upon at first instance had altered his or her opinion in a significant respect. 

91It would be contrary to the principle of finality, and inconsistent with the function of this Court on an application for leave to appeal against sentence, to adopt an approach which encouraged a sentenced person to seek out medical and psychiatric opinion after sentence, and before appeal, on matters which were the subject of reports tendered at first instance. 

92The observations of RS Hulme J in Einfeld v R at 45-46 [193] are pertinent:

""One cannot but be conscious of the frequency, and it may be ease, with which psychiatrists disagree with diagnoses of other psychiatrists. I am by no means persuaded that this Court is obliged to receive as evidence in an appeal any and every fresh diagnosis made since a sentence was imposed upon the ground that the fresh diagnosis reflects a condition not fully known or appreciated at the time of a sentence under appeal. However, in light of the previous order of the Court in this appeal and the attitude of the Crown during the hearing before us, I need say no more on this topic.""

93The practical consequences of what the Applicant seeks to do were the subject of discussion at the hearing in this Court. If the report of Dr Kasinathan was admitted as additional evidence, how was this Court to proceed in resolving what appeared to be a difference of opinion between the two psychiatrists? And where would the process end? It was submitted for the Applicant that remittal to the District Court may be appropriate to allow the areas of dispute to be explored further in that Court.

94In my view, the report of Dr Kasinathan is not admissible as fresh evidence on this application. 

95It should be observed, in any event, that the effect of the report of Dr Kasinathan is itself not substantial. Dr Kasinathan raises the prospect of autism spectrum disorder of such a mild nature that its presence may not have been detected by Dr Allnutt. The faintness of the suggested condition indicates that, even if the report had been before the sentencing Judge, it would have had no real bearing on the exercise of sentencing discretion. Further, Dr Kasinathan confirms the diagnosis of sexual sadism disorder, a conclusion effectively reached by Dr Allnutt and presented to the sentencing Judge.

96If Dr Kasinathan's report had been admitted, I am not persuaded that it would have any material bearing on issues including the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, his level of moral culpability or the application of the principles of general deterrence and personal deterrence. 

97The Applicant has not demonstrated a miscarriage of justice as contended for in Ground 9.

98I would decline to admit the report of Dr Kasinathan and, as a consequence, would reject Ground 9.

Grounds 1 and 2 - The Pearce v The Queen and Totality Grounds

99It is convenient to consider Grounds 1 and 2 together.

Submissions of the Parties

100Ms Francis submits that the sentencing Judge did not comply with the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 and did not fix an appropriate sentence for each offence before moving to issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality. In particular, it was submitted that his Honour's approach failed to have regard to the fact that the offences formed part of the one incident. The Applicant submitted that error had been demonstrated in these respects. 

101The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge applied the relevant principles and indeed said that that was what he had done. Likewise, his Honour adverted to totality and considered discretionary matters relevant to issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality. 

Decision

102The sentencing Judge adverted expressly to the principles in Pearce v The Queen, noting that he had borne them in mind (see [65]-[66] above). It is not necessary for a sentencing Judge to recite in detail the relevant principles for the purpose of applying them. 

103The Applicant's complaint is similar to that made (and rejected) in R v Murray [2003] NSWCCA 209, where Howie J (Tobias JA and James J agreeing) said at [16]:

""I do not believe that the criticism is justified. I do not understand why her Honour should not be taken at her word; being that she determined the appropriate sentence for each offence and then determined the total sentence to be imposed having regard to the principle of totality. The fact that she announced what the total sentence would be before indicating how the individual sentences should be structured is not in conflict with the way that her Honour said she had determined the sentences. Pearce contains no prohibition on indicating what the total sentence should be before indicating how the individual sentences are to be structured. There is no reason not to assume that before her Honour embarked upon her sentencing remarks she would have determined what the sentence was to be both as to its individual parts and as to its total length.""

104As McCallum J (Simpson and Bellew JJ agreeing) observed in Suman v R [2013] NSWCCA 3 at [24]:

""The remarks on sentence should not be construed as if his Honour came on to the bench not knowing what sentences he would pass, exposing the sequence of his deliberations with each further remark.""

105The sentencing Judge in this case was clearly conscious that sentences were to be imposed for two offences (and Form 1 matters) arising from a sequence of offences committed against the same victim. Oral submissions had been made immediately before sentence was passed, in which issues of accumulation, concurrency, totality and special circumstances where addressed. 

106His Honour's remarks on sentence do not reveal error. No elaborate verbal formula was required. What was necessary was for the sentencing Judge to have regard to the principles in Pearce v The Queen and issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality. It has not been demonstrated that his Honour erred in this respect.

107I would reject Grounds 1 and 2.
 

Ground 3 - Claim of Error in Failing to Give Appropriate Weight to Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

Submissions of the Parties

108Counsel for the Applicant acknowledged that the sentencing Judge had referred to the Applicant's subjective circumstances in the passages from the remarks on sentence extracted at [62]-[64] above. Whilst recognising the discretion vested in the sentencing Judge, it was submitted that the sentences ultimately imposed did not adequately reflect what were said to be significant subjective features of the Applicant's case.

109Reference was made in submissions to the Applicant's apology to the victim and what was said to be his significant chance of successful rehabilitation given his young age. It was submitted that the sentencing Judge had made no mention of the apology nor was any finding made as to remorse or the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. 

110The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge did have regard to the Applicant's subjective circumstances, including the need for extensive counselling and rehabilitation. A finding of special circumstances was made. 

111It was submitted that the Applicant had been afforded a discount for remorse over and above the discount afforded for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty, given the 28.5% discount which reduced the head sentence from 14 years to 10 years.

Decision

112The failure of a sentencing Judge to attribute sufficient weight to an issue at sentence will not generally be a material error. Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first-instance Judge, and the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49 at [25].

113A ground of appeal asserting that a Judge attributed insufficient weight to an issue has the inherent problem of implicitly acknowledging that some weight has been placed on the issue: DF v R [2012] NSWCCA 171 at [77].

114The Applicant contends that the absence of reference to remorse and the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation in the remarks on sentence indicates a failure to have regard to these matters. It is necessary to keep in mind that his Honour's remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore immediately after the sentencing hearing. In Currie v R [2013] NSWCCA 267, with the agreement of Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J, I said at [50]-[51]:

""50 As Spigelman CJ observed in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at 577 [48], the conditions under which District Court Judges give such reasons 'are not such as to permit their remarks to be parsed and analysed'. In R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130; 221 A Crim R 175 at 180-181 [34], with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlag J, I observed:

'... it is necessary to keep in mind that the remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore immediately following the sentencing hearing on 3 February 2012. This course had the undoubted advantage that those present in Court could hear immediately the sentence which was passed and his Honour's reasons for passing that sentence. A consequence of this approach, which is understandable in a busy court, is that remarks on sentence may not be 'as robustly structured as they might otherwise have been' (Simpson J in Simkhada v R [2010] NSWCCA 284 at [24]) and may 'lack the order and precision of language that can be incorporated into a judgment after the luxury of time for consideration, refinement of expression, and polishing' (Simpson J in Rotner v R [2011] NSWCCA 207 at [57]).' 


51 It is important to keep these statements in mind, in particular, when considering submissions that his Honour did not refer in the remarks to certain matters which had been the subject of evidence and submissions at the sentencing hearing.""

115These observations are apt in the present case. 

116With respect to remorse, it should be kept in mind that the sentencing Judge applied a discount of 28.5% to reduce a head sentence of 14 years to one of 10 years. An allowance of this magnitude exceeded the 25% utilitarian discount to which the Applicant was entitled for his pleas of guilty. His Honour referred to the Applicant's acknowledgement of guilt and the saving of the victim from giving evidence (see [62] above). These are features going beyond the utilitarian discount to encompass remorse: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at 10-11 [32]. It is difficult to see how it can be contended reasonably that the sentencing Judge has not made some allowance for remorse. 

117With respect to the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, given the nature of his offences and the psychiatric and psychological evidence before the sentencing Judge, it is difficult to see that any foundation had been laid for a finding that his prospects of rehabilitation were good so as to warrant any material amelioration of penalty. Dr Allnutt expressed himself conditionally in observing that the Applicant had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, if he pursued and completed a sex offender rehabilitation program (see [50] above).

118The sentencing Judge had regard to the Applicant's ""overall need for rehabilitation"" as part of a range of factors leading to a finding of special circumstances and the setting of an overall non-parole period which was 60% of the full term.

119The Applicant has not demonstrated error on the part of the sentencing Judge with respect to the approach taken by his Honour to the weight to be accorded to the Applicant's subjective circumstances. It has not been demonstrated that the matters relied upon were not taken into account in the exercise of the instinctive synthesis undertaken by his Honour.

120I would reject Ground 3.

Ground 4 - Claim of Error in Failing to Take Into Account the Restrictive Nature of the Applicant's Presentence Bail Conditions

Submissions of the Parties

121Ms Francis submitted that the Applicant had been subject to very restrictive bail conditions from the time of his arrest on 18 February 2011 until he entered custody on 8 June 2012. The conditions included restrictions upon his ability to leave his residence other than in the presence of nominated persons. It was submitted for the Applicant that his Honour's approach to the bail restriction issue was to confine it because it allowed him an opportunity to seek medical assistance to be put forward as part of his plea in mitigation (see [64] above).

122Ms Francis submitted that greater weight ought to have been given to this factor in the circumstances of the case. 

123The Crown submitted that the Applicant's bail position was not analogous to a situation where a person is required to reside in a rehabilitation facility so that a form of quasi-custody may arise. The Crown submitted that the Applicant was not entitled to any additional weight being accorded to this factor in the circumstances of the case.
 
Decision

124The aspect of the Applicant's bail conditions to which attention is drawn under this ground is the residential condition which operated between 18 February 2011 and 8 June 2012. This condition permitted the Applicant to leave his residence in the company of one of several nominated family members. It is understandable that such a condition was put in place given the need, amongst other things, to ensure there was no direct or indirect contact between the Applicant and the victim or any member of the victim's family. 

125There was no curfew condition in place. The Applicant was able to leave his residence at any time and for any purpose, as long as he was in the company of one of a nominated list of persons.

126The bail conditions placed some restrictions upon the Applicant. That is the nature of bail conditions, especially where the person is charged with serious offences as in this case.

127The Applicant was not required to reside in a treatment facility. That scenario, which takes a person away from his or her home into an institutional setting as a condition of bail, is recognised as being capable (depending upon the circumstances) of being a form of quasi-custody: Renshaw v R [2012] NSWCCA 91 at [28]-[32]. 

128It is difficult to see that a requirement to live at home with one's family, and to be accompanied by one or other of a number of nominated relatives when not at home, operated in a way so as to mitigate penalty in this case. Restrictive accommodation requirements do not necessarily amount to quasi-custody: R v Perry [2000] NSWCCA 375 at [33]. 

129The sentencing Judge was not required, as a matter of principle, to take the Applicant's bail conditions into account in his favour on sentence in the manner complained of in this ground. No error has been demonstrated. 

130I would reject this ground of appeal.

Grounds 6 and 7 - Claim of Error in Assessment of Objective Seriousness and in Failure to Give Reasons Concerning the s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900 Offence

131The parties linked these grounds for the purpose of submissions and it is appropriate that the same course be adopted in addressing their merit. 

Submissions of the Parties

132Ms Francis submitted that the sentencing Judge's characterisation of the offences as being ""very serious"" (see [61] above) gave rise to error in this case. It was noted that the s.61M(2) offence carried a standard non-parole period, with an additional requirement to give reasons specified by statute. Although there was no standard non-parole period for the s.37 offence, it was submitted that it remained necessary for the sentencing Judge to assess the objective seriousness of that offence and to provide reasons for the conclusion reached as part of the sentencing process. Reliance was placed upon several authorities and, in particular, R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304.

133With respect to the s.37 offence, it was submitted that a wide range of conduct may give rise to that offence so that an appropriate assessment of objective seriousness is required in order to comply with statements of the High Court in Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447.

134In relation to the s.61M(2) offence, it was submitted that an erroneous approach had been adopted with an absence of reasons as required by law. 

135The Crown submitted that the approach adopted by the sentencing Judge did not reveal error. To the extent that the Applicant sought to rely upon R v Cage, the Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge in this case went beyond a bare recitation of the facts in expressing the conclusion that the offences were very serious.

136In relation to the s.37 offence, the Crown submitted that there being no standard non-parole period applicable, it was not necessary to assess the offending by reference to a range of objective seriousness. 

137With respect to Ground 7, the Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge did provide sufficient reasons to comply with s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

Decision

138Ground 7 ought be considered first. Since the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, a less prescriptive approach is required in sentencing for standard non-parole period offences. The requirement to give reasons for the purpose of s.54B(4) may be satisfied by reference to the remarks on sentence viewed as a whole. 

139In the present case, the sentencing Judge adverted to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period and determined that the s.61M(2) offence was very serious. Regard was had to a variety of other factors bearing upon sentencing for this offence. 

140The sentence ultimately imposed for this offence sheds some light upon his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence. The sentence comprised a non-parole period of three years and nine months with a balance of term of one year and three months. The maximum penalty was 10 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of eight years. 

141I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to give reasons, for the purpose of s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in the manner asserted in Ground 7.

142This conclusion applies, as well, to the complaint in Ground 6 insofar as that extends to the offence under s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900. Error is not demonstrated in that respect.

143It is the case that s.37 Crimes Act 1900 is capable of applying to a range of circumstances. Some assessment of objective gravity is appropriate as part of the sentencing process: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354; Khoury v R at 523 [71]. That said, this does not give rise to an obligation to provide elaborate reasoning in the circumstances of a particular case. It is not necessary to make a finding as to where precisely the offence lay in a spectrum of offending: Khoury v R at 523 [74]; Charbaji v R [2011] NSWCCA 181 at [15]. 

144The sentencing Judge here did not rely upon a bare recitation of the facts as in R v Cage. The s.37 offence was assessed, correctly, as being ""very serious"". An examination of the present case confirms that this was a serious example of a crime of this type. Indeed, the plea in mitigation was made by counsel for the Applicant at first instance upon the basis that these were serious offences. No submission was made for the Applicant that a more precise finding should be made concerning the objective gravity of the offences.

145The Applicant's s.37 offence involved an attempt to choke the 15-year-old victim with an intent to commit an indictable offence, namely to detain him for advantage without consent. The concept of ""advantage"" in s.86(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 has been interpreted broadly, extending (amongst other things) to psychological gratification or satisfaction: R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130; 221 A Crim R 175 at 185 [50]. 

146The circumstances of the present case reveal the Applicant attempting to choke the 15-year-old victim in the context of a non-consensual sexual event, with sadomasochistic overtones. The sexual context is entirely clear from the s.61M(2) offence, accompanied by highly disturbing features such as the placing of a bag over the victim's head and the securing of his hands by tying with a belt and tie. To introduce into this multifaceted event an attempt to choke the victim constitutes a most serious example of an offence under s.37 Crimes Act 1900. The victim was unable to breathe and almost passed out.

147In my view, the law required the sentencing Judge to do no more than was done in this case by way of the characterisation of the Applicant's s.37 offence as being ""very serious"". This assessment is to be viewed in the light of a fair reading of his Honour's remarks on sentence in their entirety.

148No error has been demonstrated by the Applicant in the approach taken by the sentencing Judge. 

149I would reject Grounds 6 and 7.

Ground 5 - Claim of Manifest Excess

Submissions of the Parties

150The Applicant submitted that the individual sentences, and the total effective sentence, were manifestly excessive when full account is had to the objective and subjective circumstances of the case.

151Ms Francis emphasised the Applicant's youth and prior good character in support of this ground and the psychiatric and psychological evidence before the sentencing Judge.

152The Crown submitted that the individual sentences and the overall effective sentence were not manifestly excessive. The Crown emphasised the gravity of the offending conduct and the need to have regard to the Form 1 matters in the imposition of sentence. 

Decision

153To make good this ground, the Applicant must demonstrate that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust. It is necessary for the Applicant to establish that the total effective sentence was manifestly too long: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325 [6]. 

154The Applicant's offences involved the illegal entry of the victim's home at an early hour, at a time when it may be inferred he knew that the victim would be alone. The offences involved a significant level of planning. The Applicant came equipped with items to restrain the victim and, by use of the bag, to reduce the prospects of identification.

155The 15-year-old victim was asleep in his own bed when he was accosted by the Applicant, who placed the bag over his head and bound his hands. The terrifying nature of these acts is self-evident. 

156What happened thereafter involved the commission of the aggravated indecent assault offence, demonstrating the sexual motivation of the attack. Any resistance by the victim was controlled by the Applicant. The Applicant struck the victim several times. The attempt to choke the victim constituted a serious escalation in the criminal acts being committed against the victim. The Applicant was acting out a sexual fantasy he had entertained for some two years (see [47] above). The Applicant's crimes included sadomasochistic features, involving bondage with a clear sexual context. 

157It may be inferred that it took some measure of determined resistance on the part of the victim, in the form of biting the Applicant, to bring the criminal attack to its end. 

158As was to be expected, the adolescent victim has suffered significantly from these offences. Psychological damage has been suffered with erosion in his confidence impacting upon his education and family life. It was necessary for the sentences to recognise the psychological harm done to the young victim: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [110].

159This case should be regarded as a serious example of offending of this type. An examination of other s.37 cases, and the principles emerging from them, does not assist the Applicant in this case: R v HQ [2003] NSWCCA 336; McKechnie v R [2006] NSWCCA 13; R v MW [2007] NSWCCA 291; Munn v R [2009] NSWCCA 218; R v Cutrale [2011] NSWCCA 214 and R v O'Connor [2014] NSWCCA 53.

160Although there was overlap between the offences on the indictment and the Form 1 offences, it was necessary for the sentencing Judge to have proper regard to the Form 1 matters on sentence for the s.37 offence, in accordance with the principles in Attorney General's Application Under s37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146.

161These were highly disturbing offences committed by a 20-year-old offender. 

162In my view, the sentencing Judge gave appropriate weight to the Applicant's youth and prior good character, together with his subjective circumstances as revealed in the evidence placed before the District Court. These factors served to ameliorate the sentences which might otherwise have been passed for serious sexual and violent offending of this type. 

163In Elias v The Queen [2013] HCA 31; 248 CLR 483, the High Court said at 494-495 [27] (footnotes omitted):

""As this Court has explained on more than one occasion, the factors bearing on the determination of sentence will frequently pull in different directions. It is the duty of the judge to balance often incommensurable factors and to arrive at a sentence that is just in all of the circumstances. The administration of the criminal law involves individualised justice, the attainment of which is acknowledged to involve the exercise of a wide sentencing discretion.""

164The sentencing Judge in the present case discharged this duty, as part of a process of instinctive synthesis, in a manner which is not indicative of error.

165The question to be answered is whether the Applicant has demonstrated that the sentences imposed for the offences and, in particular, the total effective sentence and non-parole period were, in the circumstances of this case, unreasonable or plainly unjust. 

166In my view, a total effective non-parole period of six years with a balance of term of four years, cannot be regarded as manifestly excessive when regard is had to all the circumstances and, in particular, to the objective gravity of the Applicant's crimes: R v Dodd at 354.

167I would reject Ground 5.

Conclusion

168The Applicant has failed to make good any of the grounds of appeal relied upon in this Court. 

169The orders I propose are that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

170RS HULME AJ: I agree with Johnson J.

		15 May 2014",2014-05-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763912,R v Ly [2014] NSWCCA 78,"Judgment

1THE COURT: The Crown appeals, pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), against a sentence imposed upon the respondent on 6 March 2013 by the District Court.

2The respondent was charged on indictment with one offence pursuant to s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (Code), namely that between about 7 January 2008 and 5 November 2008 she dealt with money or other property that was, and which she believed to be, the proceeds of crime and at the time of dealing the value of that money was $100,000 or more. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 400.4(1) is 20 years imprisonment or 1200 penalty units ($204,000), or both.

3In the alternative, the respondent was charged with an offence pursuant to s 400.4(2) of the Code, namely, that between about 7 January 2008 and 5 November 2008 the respondent dealt with money or other property that was the proceeds of crime and was reckless as to the fact that the money or other property was the proceeds of crime and at the time of dealing the value of that money was $100,000 or more. The maximum penalty under this provision is 10 years imprisonment or 600 penalty units ($102,000), or both.

4On 2 November 2012, after a 20 day trial, a jury found the respondent guilty of the money laundering offence under s 400.4(1).

5On 6 March 2013, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 3 years 6 months (expiring 1 May 2016), with a non-parole period of 2 years 4 months (expiring 1 March 2015). His Honour also made a reparation order pursuant to s 21B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in the sum of $331,862.

6The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions lodged a Notice of Appeal on 28 March 2013. The single ground of appeal is that the sentences imposed upon the respondent were manifestly inadequate.

The Facts

7On 27 August 2010, the respondent, Christina My Phung Ly, was arrested and charged with the offence pursuant to s 400.4(1), and the offence pursuant to s 400.4(2) in the alternative. 

8The charges related to the alleged laundering of money by the respondent in the sum of $357,568.

9This money stems from a series of frauds committed on the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), involving the identify theft of 21 taxpayers and the lodgement of 24 false income tax returns between 1 January and 24 October 2008. Each income tax return claimed tax refunds on behalf of the taxpayers upon the basis of falsely inflated details of income tax instalment payments and falsely inflated details of the tax deductions. The 24 tax refunds, totalling $357,568, were paid into seven bank accounts solely controlled by the respondent. 

10Each of the income tax returns was in the name of a taxpayer who was unaware that his or her identity and tax file number was being used and had no knowledge of the lodgement or the electronic refund payment.

11The only significant source of funds deposited into the respondent's seven bank accounts was the proceeds of the tax frauds, with the exception of $2,650. All of the funds credited to the respondent's seven bank accounts during the relevant period were derived from the fraudulently obtained income tax returns. Most of the refunds were transferred between the respondent's bank accounts and then withdrawn shortly after they had been deposited. 

12Nine of the 24 income tax returns lodged by the respondent were lodged by telephone via the ATO's interactive voice recognition service, known as ""telefile"". The voice recordings of these telephone lodgements were retained by the ATO and tendered at the trial. 

13Evidence at the trial, from a voice comparison expert and a friend of the respondent familiar with her voice, established it was the respondent's voice in the nine recordings, and that in two of those recordings the respondent disguised her voice as a male voice for the purposes of lodging income tax returns in the names of male taxpayers.

14In the Crown's Submissions on Sentence it was contended that a significant full time custodial sentence was, in the absence of a finding of exceptional circumstances, the only appropriate sentence in this case. The Crown noted the seriousness of the offence, the offender's criminality, the need for general deterrence, and the large amount of money involved.

15At the date of sentencing the respondent had already spent three months and thirty days in custody in relation to the offence. 

16The sentencing judge noted that in sentencing Commonwealth offenders the Court is required to have regard to the matters set out in Part 1B of the Crimes Act (Cth), specifically s 16A, which provides a check list of the matters that a court should take into account. These include:

1. The nature and circumstances of the offence;
2. Other offences (if any) that are required or permitted to be taken into account;
3. Any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;
4. The degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence, by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence, or in any other manner;
5. The deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on the person;
6. The need to ensure the person is adequately punished for the offence;
7. The character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person;
8. The prospects of rehabilitation of the person.

17The sentencing judge noted that general deterrence may also be taken into account, despite not being included in that checklist: Remarks on Sentence at p 4.

18His Honour found, consistent with the jury's verdict, that the respondent was responsible for lodging the 24 false income tax returns. 

19His Honour considered that ""there could have been no doubt that she did deal with the money which she believed, and in fact, knew to be the proceeds of crime and at the time the value of the money was over $100,000"": Remarks on Sentence at p 2.

20His Honour then said:

""The offence reflected a serious course of criminal conduct, as I have stated, over a period of ten months between 7 January 2008 and 5 November 2008. The offender dealt with the proceeds of crime, namely money, totalling $357,568 believing, and in fact knowing, the money to be proceedings of crime. She was the principal offender and significant beneficiary. The offence was sophisticated and involved a concerted scheme flowing from the frauds of the ATO. All false income tax returns were lodged by her. It is not known how she was able to obtain knowledge of the individuals' tax file numbers"": Remarks on Sentence at p 5.

21Despite acknowledging that the lodgement of the income tax returns by the respondent was not an element of the offence, his Honour considered that that was a fact that was relevant to sentencing in terms of the following matters:

1. The objective seriousness of the respondent's conduct in committing the offence;
2. The extent of the respondent's role in laundering the money; and
3. The degree to which the respondent believed that the money was the proceeds of crime when she dealt with the money: Remarks on Sentence at p 3.

22The sentencing judge further found that the impact of respondent's conduct on the 21 victims was ""severe"" and had imperilled their finances. His Honour noted that ""there was evidence of the pervasive effect this had upon the victims and the consequence frustration and entanglement of their financial affairs, which in some cases has only now been resolved"": Remarks on Sentence at p 9.

23His Honour also noted that ""the offence was committed more, in my view, out of greed rather than need"": Remarks on Sentence at p 9.

24In response to the Crown's submission that the proceeds were used to support the respondent's ""lavish lifestyle"", the sentencing judge said a better word might be ""extravagant"", having regard to a significant proportion of the funds being directed towards the respondent's credit card debts: Remarks on Sentence at p 9.

25The sentencing Judge took into account as part of the subjective case a report by a psychologist, Dr Jacmon, dated 25 February 2013 tendered on behalf of the respondent. This report concluded that the respondent's functioning at the time of the offending conduct was markedly impaired by pathological gambling, substance dependence, and depression at clinically significant levels. 

26Dr Jacmon noted that anxiety and depression arose from inter-related downturns in the respondent's life, including the deteriorating relationship with her partner, his infidelity and violence in the relationship, and the removal of her three children into foster care.

27However, the sentencing judge determined that Dr Jacmon's opinions had only limited weight, observing at page 10 of the Remarks on Sentence:

1. The first order for the removal of her children took place eight months after the commission of this offence.
2. The apprehended violence order arising from the respondent's relationship with her partner was made three years after the commission of this offence. 
3. There was no evidence of any connection between the alleged gambling addiction and the offending conduct. 
4. There was no evidence that anxiety, depression, gambling, drug addiction, or any cognitive deficiency played any part in the offending conduct or that the respondent was unable to determine right from wrong, or unable to determine if what she was doing was illegal: Remarks on Sentence at p 7.

28Subjectively, however, the sentencing judge took into account that the respondent may have been using drugs at the time of the offence, and that the later loss of her children represented hardship for her and possible hardship for her children: Remarks on Sentence at p 7.

29Other subjective matters taken into account by the sentencing judge included the following:

1. The respondent was 33 years of age at the time of sentence and was residing with her parents after separating from her partner in October 2011. 
2. The respondent had completed year 12 studies and then went to university to study food technology, but did not complete the course. 
3. The respondent's lack of remorse or contrition, which was a ""worrying feature"", and her denial of responsibility for the offence. 
4. The matters outlined in the Probation and Parole Report, including the respondent's failure ""to recognise that she self-medicates with illicit drug use due to the impact that her lifestyle has had on her children"", and a recognition that she has effectively lost her children because of her choices. In addition, she appeared to have ""demonstrated deterioration of the values she once portrayed in exchange for greed and immediate gratification"". Further, although initially presenting as closed, the respondent was observed as being motivated towards change and able to explore interventions which would assist in her goal to start afresh and work towards becoming the mother to her children that she wants to be: Remarks on Sentence at pp 8-9.

30His Honour also found that the respondent had some rehabilitation prospects, as evidenced by her desire to be reunited with her family: Remarks on Sentence at p 8.

31With regard to the respondent's antecedent history, the sentencing judge noted that although those convictions ""do not disclose a history of what might be regarded as very serious offences, they do disclose a history of dishonesty"": Remarks on Sentence at p 9.

32The respondent's history includes a fine for larceny in 1995 and fines in 1996 for having goods in custody, supplying a false name and address and interfering in the comfort of others. In 2011 the respondent was placed on three bonds for three years for dishonestly obtaining property by deception, making a false document to obtain property and using a false document to obtain property. There were a further two bonds in 2011 for three years for dishonestly obtaining property by deception and possession of identification information to commit an indictable offence. 

33His Honour, however, noted that this offence would represent the respondent's first time in custody. 

34There was no challenge made on this appeal to the factual findings made by the sentencing judge. 

35After having regard to all the objective and subjective matters, the sentencing judge concluded that the offence was ""objectively a very serious offence"", and that ""to award a lesser sentence would not reflect the seriousness of the offence or give proper effect to the sentencing principles"" to which his Honour had earlier referred. 

36His Honour imposed the sentence of imprisonment for 3 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years 4 months, together with a reparation order pursuant to s 21B of the Crimes Act (Cth) in the sum of $331,862.

Crown's Submissions

37The Crown case on appeal was that ""the sentence imposed reveals such manifest inadequacy as to constitute latent error in principle relating to the objective seriousness of the offending, the maximum penalty, and unjustifiable disparity with appellate money laundering sentence cases, and the need for general deterrence"": Crown's Written Submissions at [4].

38The Crown argued that these proceedings involved a ""high level of objective seriousness"" which was ""at the upper level...committed as a principal"" and that the ""respondent was not a mere runner or bagman and there was no issue of merely recklessness or reasonably to have known it was the proceeds of crime, she undoubtedly knew it"": T1, 4 December 2013.

39It was submitted that the sentence imposed, taking into account all relevant matters, did not reflect the circumstances of the particular offence committed by the respondent, and as a result, constituted ""an affront to community standards"". Further, that the sentence was so ""disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience"": Crown's Written Submissions at [22].

40In this regard, the Crown argued that the sentence imposed ""was as though it was a guilty plea and as though there were substantial mitigating circumstances"": T 1:50 - T 2:1. The Crown in fact contended that a sentence double that which was imposed ""would have been entirely defensible"": T 2: 11-12.

41The Crown accepted that the sentencing judge correctly outlined the features establishing the objective seriousness of the respondent's conduct, and further accepts the sentencing judge's characterisation of the respondent's position in the offending hierarchy: Crown's Written Submissions at [12].

42The Crown submissions noted that its appeal is ""very much directed at error in the result arrived at, rather than any identifiable error in the reasoning prior to the pronouncement of sentence"": Crown's Written Submissions at [22].

43The Crown's submissions relied upon the following:

(a) Failure to translate the offending into a sentence of the severity required by law

44The Crown submitted that the objectively very serious features of the offending conduct were not adequately reflected in the sentence. 

45Although the Crown accepted that the sentencing judge correctly described and characterised the offending, the Crown submitted that his Honour ""failed to translate this into a sentence of the severity required by law"": Crown's Written Submissions at [25].

46The Crown noted that a primary feature of the structure of money laundering offences in the Code is that ""the greater the sum of money involved, the more serious the offence"": Crown's Written Submissions at [18]. The effect of this is that ""an offence dealing with proceeds of crime or instruments of crime is more serious"": Crown's Written Submissions at [19].

47The Crown submitted that the respondent's criminality was at the ""higher end of the scale of objective seriousness of dealings between $100,000 and $1 million, with the learned sentencing judge correctly finding little in the way of mitigation"": Crown's Written Submissions at [21].

48The Crown considered the relevant factors identified in the authorities, and in particular, the following were emphasised as being of significance: 

1. The respondent played a principal role.
2. The respondent knew that the funds were the proceeds of crime. 
3. The number of transactions carried out by the respondent, namely, 24.
4. The offending took place over a period of 10 months. 
5. The degree of planning or deceit that led to the commission of the offence. 

49The Crown also submitted that the respondent and her partner were the beneficiaries of the tax refund payments falsely generated by her. It was the Crown's submission that the refunds were principally spent to support a lavish lifestyle, including expenditure at public bars, hotels, restaurants and accommodation, as well as to reduce the debt owing on the respondent's credit card: Crown's Written Submissions at [10].

50In addition, the Crown submitted that this matter:

""... was one which was virtually devoid of mitigating circumstances of any kind. The crime was committed out of greed. There was no contrition or remorse and there was a lengthy history of dishonest offences ... it certainly wasn't a first offence"": T1, 4 December 2013.

(b) An unjustifiable disparity between the sentence imposed and sentences imposed in comparable matters

(i) Comparable cases

51The Crown provided to the sentencing judge a schedule of comparative intermediate appeal sentence cases for offences under ss 400.3(1), 400.3(3), 400.4(1) and 400.4(2) of the Code.

52The Crown submitted in the hearing of the appeal that an analysis of these penalties establishes that an ""unjustifiable disparity between the sentence in the present appeal and the sentences imposed in comparable matters"": Crown's Written Submissions at [27].

53Extracted below are the relevant cases considered by the Crown in its written submissions and the sentences imposed; the facts of each case are considered in more detail later in these reasons.





Case

Amount of proceeds

Sentence imposed


R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; 174 A Crim R 370

$556,400

5 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months.

The Crown noted that the Court held that starting sentence before applying discounts for early plea and assistance should have been at least 8 years, although a more appropriate starting point was between 9 and 11 years.


R v Foster [2008] QCA 90; 183 A Crim R 437

More than $300,000

4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months. 

The Crown noted that the Queensland Court of Appeal held the appropriate head sentence, before discounts for plea and other factors, was between 6 and 8 years imprisonment.


Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294; 198 A Crim R 135

$103,512

2 years 8 months.

The Crown noted the Court of Appeal held the head sentence, before plea and other factors, was in excess of 3 years 7 months.


Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 269 ALR 115

$243,952

3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 2 months.

The Crown noted the sentencing judge considered the head sentence, before plea and other factors, was 7 years


Ungureanu v R [2012] WASCA 11; 272 FLR 84

$500,000

7 years (after an unquantified discount for plea and co-operation), with a non-parole period of 4 years

54With regard to Thorn, the Crown noted there was a combination of unusual circumstances that had the effect of reducing the sentence, including:

1. Delays in the ATO's investigation, during which time the offender completely rehabilitated, and his age and rehabilitation at the time of sentence made him a less suitable candidate as an example to others. Accordingly, general deterrence was of reduced significance. 
2. A monetary overlap of about $39,000 between the money laundering offence and a related fraud offence. This also meant the penalty under s 400.4(1) was not a reliable guide. 

55The Crown in its written submissions stated that in the event its appeal was successful and the Court proceeded to re-sentence, there might be a need to reconsider the correctness of this Court's decision in Thorn v The Queen, supra, in light of recent High Court decision in Elias v The Queen; Issa v The Queen [2013] HCA 31; (2013) 87 ALJR 895: at [39].

56It was the Crown's submission that:

""In light of Elias and in this context, also having regard to the role of the maximum penalty described in Markarian, and the approach to Criminal Code interpretation dictated by JS, it is respectfully submitted that the distinction created by Thorn is artificial and contrary to authority. It is submitted that reliance on the predicate offence as a guide to sentencing for money laundering offences is no longer good law and ought to be reconsidered"": at [44].

57It was the Crown's submission that these authorities revealed a range of head sentences of imprisonment between 6 and 11 years, before taking into account a guilty plea. However, the Crown noted that whilst there is:

""no single correct sentence or range of correct sentences, sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases, with consistency in the application of relevant legal principles so as to achieve reasonable consistency in treating like cases alike"": Crown's Written Submissions at [29].

58As to the above suggested range, it was noted that this was an indicative range rather than an absolute range: T 4:26-27.

59The Crown argued that the respondent's sentence, which came after a defended trial, was a little over half of the bottom end of the appellate pattern of sentences for guilty plea cases, and therefore necessarily less than half of what would have been expected had those matters been defended: Crown's Written Submissions at [29].

60The Crown further argued that this disparity could not be explained by any particular features of this case compared to prior cases, and accordingly, that the respondent's sentence met and exceeded the test of failing to constitute reasonable consistency, and amounted to manifest inadequacy.

(ii) Sentence imposed on the respondent's co-offender

61Mr Tilocca, the respondent's partner at the time of the commission of the offences, was her co-offender. 

62Mr Tilocca pleaded guilty to an offence pursuant to s 400.4(2) of the Code arising from the lodgement of 19 different false income tax returns which generated 19 fraudulently obtained income tax refunds totalling $245,189. As noted above at the outset of these reasons, the maximum penalty for an offence under s 400.4(2) is 10 years imprisonment or a fine of 600 penalty units, or both.

63Although the Crown noted that ""no true question of parity arises"", it was submitted that the sentence imposed on Mr Tilocca ""is relevant because it helps to demonstrate error in the sentence imposed on the respondent"": Crown's Written Submissions at [31].

64Mr Tilocca was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 2 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years, after a 10% discount for a guilty plea. Accordingly, the head sentence without the discount was slightly in excess of 3 years.

65The Crown submitted that Mr Tilocca's offending was objectively significantly less serious than that of the respondent having regard to the following factors:

1. The lesser amount involved;
2. Mr Tilocca was sentenced for an offence that carried half the maximum penalty to that of s 400.4(1);
3. Mr Tilocca's lesser role, given there was no evidence that he had committed frauds on the ATO;
4. The lesser fault element of Mr Tilocca's offence, namely, recklessness as opposed to belief; and
5. Mr Tilocca's plea of guilty.

(c) A failure to adequately reflect the element of general deterrence and the legislative intent of Parliament in recognising the seriousness of such offending

66The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge did not adequately reflect the principle of general deterrence, and that it ""had long been recognised that general deterrence is of particular importance in sentencing for Commonwealth offences"": Crown's Written Submissions at [36].

67In support of this submission, the Crown cited the judgment of this Court in R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; 174 A Crim R 370:

""Money laundering on the scale in which both respondents were involved should be considered as serious criminal activity that is at the very heart of organised, professional crime syndicates. It warrants severe punishment not the least in order to reflect general deterrence of a very significant degree ..."": at [36].

Respondent's Submissions

68The main submission for the respondent was that the sentence imposed did not involve a miscarriage of justice and was not so manifestly inadequate as to warrant appellate intervention: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 27; (2013) 302 ALR 192. The respondent's written submissions are summarised below; the oral submissions made on her behalf are addressed later in these reasons.

69In considering the table of sentences in comparable matters provided by the Crown, it was the respondent's submission that these should be treated with caution having regard to the judgment of this Court in R v Wing Cheong Li; Wing Cheong Li v R [2010] NSWCCA 125; 202 A Crim R 195:

""Although the number of money laundering cases dealt with by the appellate courts is growing, it is still small. The cases do not even begin to trace the limits of the range of proper sentencing discretion. They can do no more in my opinion than produce a broad indication of the developing sentencing practice"": at [40].

70The respondent also cited the High Court's judgment in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520, which quoted with approval Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1:

""[A] history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. ... 'Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.' But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix 'the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence'. Past sentences 'are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence' (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, 'it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that ""unifying principles"" may be discerned'"": at 537.

71Accordingly, it was argued that appellate intervention ""is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"": Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [58], cited with approval in Hili v The Queen, supra, at [59].

72It was also submitted that such decisions do not constitute a ""binding precedent"", and that the issue of parity in sentencing is not available to the Crown: Respondent's Written Submissions at [16].

73The respondent's submission was that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge ""does fall within the available range, and can, therefore, not be considered to be manifestly inadequate"": Respondent's Written Submissions at [8].

74Accordingly, the Crown's submission with regard to the available sentencing range, it was argued by the respondent, ""does nothing to assist in determining the outcome of the present appeal"": Respondent's Written Submissions at [15].

75The respondent further submitted that there was nothing in the Remarks on Sentence to indicate that his Honour did not apply the relevant statutory provisions: Respondent's Written Submissions at [18].

76The respondent's submission was that on the basis of the multitude of factors and ""variables"" in the present case (R v Wing Cheong Li; Wing Cheong Li v R [2010] NSWCCA 125; 202 A Crim R 195 at [41]), the sentencing judge was ""perfectly entitled to arrive at the sentence imposed upon the respondent"": at [20].

77With respect to the Crown's submissions on the need for general deterrence, the respondent submitted that this was non-existent, given that there was no suggestion of ""serious criminal activity that is at the heart of organised, professional crime syndicates"", and further, that ""where the act of laundering consists of no more than gaining access to ill-gotten gains ... general deterrence is promoted by the potential punishment for the anterior offence"": at [21]-[22].

78Finally, the respondent submitted that the correctness of Thorn did not arise for consideration, as the sentencing judge expressly stated that he distinguished the decision:

""The defence referred to the decisions in Escambi v The Crown [2010] NSWCCA 159 and Thorne v The Crown [2009] NSWCCA [sic] and in my view they are distinguishable from the position here. They were cases where offenders were charged with both fraud and money laundering by dealing with the proceeds of the fraud. Those authorities are in relation to the practice of charging both of those offences where they arose from precisely the same conduct and that is not the case here"": Remarks on Sentence at p 3.

79In any event, the respondent submitted that Elias did not call into question this Court's reasoning in Thorn, because this Court's reasoning in Thorn did not depend upon the availability of alternative charges, and the maximum penalties available for those charges, which, of course, was the issue considered by the High Court.

Consideration

(a) Principles relevant to Crown appeals on sentence

80The issue raised in this appeal poses the question whether the result embodied in his Honour's sentencing order was unreasonable or plainly unjust. Error of this kind is usually described in a Crown appeal as ""manifest inadequacy"": Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. As discussed in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [61] - [62], the power to set aside sentences judged to be obviously erroneous on a Crown appeal against sentence ought normally only to be exercised where error has been very clearly demonstrated.

81A principle of particular importance in a Crown appeal against sentence is that a Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion: Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15]. As there noted:

""The discretion which the law commits to sentencing judges is of vital importance in the administration of our system of criminal justice"": per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ.

82Further, the High Court has observed that:

""... appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases"": Hili v The Queen, supra, at [59].

83In Bugmy at [24] it was observed:

""However, within a range of sentences for this offence and this offender, the weight to be given to the evidence and the various, conflicting, purposes of sentencing was a matter for Judge Lerve. The authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal to substitute a sentence for that imposed by Judge Lerve was not enlivened by its view that it would have given greater weight to deterrence and less weight to the appellant's subjective case. The power could only be engaged if the Court was satisfied that Judge Lerve's discretion miscarried because in the result his Honour imposed a sentence that was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence consistently with sentencing standards. In that event, the Court was required to consider whether the Director's appeal should nonetheless be dismissed in the exercise of the residual discretion.""

84Maximum penalties invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the Court at the time of sentence, and taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, they provide a yardstick: Markarian v R at [31].

85In Ihemeje v R [2012] NSWCCA 269, Adamson J found that ""sentencing decisions for money laundering offences may provide assistance by way of general sentencing principle for this class of offence, but do not, in my view, necessarily establish a range of sentence"": at [86]. In support of this, her Honour noted the reasons of Barr AJ in R v Li [2010] NSWCCA 125; 202 A Crim R 195 at [41]:

""Notwithstanding the gridlike structure of the subsections, their graded component parts and maximum sentences, they comprehend such a wide range of criminality that there is bound, I think, to be an appreciable variation in the length of sentences within and between them. It seems to me, without undervaluing the importance of the principal differentiating factors - minimum value of money or property and state of mind - that each case will have other variables that bear on sentence. Perhaps the most important will be an exact appreciation of what the offender did, what acts he performed and with what authority and over what period of time. The total value of money or property involved will be important, and whether the money or property belonged to the offender or to another. The degree of planning or deceit that led to the commission of the offence and whether actual loss resulted, and the extent of such loss, will be important.""

(b) Money Laundering Sentencing Considerations

86The federal money laundering offences in the Code have in recent years been considered in a number of cases. Whilst each case, of course, turns on its own facts, it is useful to set out relevant considerations before determining the ground of appeal in the present proceedings.

1. The statutory scheme has a graduated series of offences varying in gravity depending on the value of the money or property and the offender's state of mind: R v Li at [17]-[19], [41].

2. The offences are broken down into the mental element of the offender: belief/intention or recklessness or negligence. The prescribed maximum penalty depends upon the culpability of the offender's mental state concerning the source of the money for offences involving proceeds of crime or what is to become of it, for offences involving an instrument of crime: R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; 174 A Crim R 370 at [28].

3. The amount of money involved is a highly significant matter and is the primary identifier of what is the maximum penalty for an offence: R v Huang; R v Siu at [34]; R v Ansari [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89 at [122]; R v Li at [41].

4. The number of transactions and the period over which they occurred are also significant matters as they indicate the extent of an offender's criminality. Generally speaking, a number of transactions involving small amounts of money will be more serious than a single transaction of a larger amount, for the latter may be seen as an isolated offence: R v Huang; R v Siu at [35]. 

5. The offences are not only concerned with the source of the money or property dealt with, but also its ultimate use. The offences cover money obtained illegally or to be used for illegal purposes or dealt with in a manner that is illegal: Sentencing Bench Book, Judicial Commission of New South Wales, at [65-205]. 

6. The serious criminal activity of money laundering warrants severe punishment not the least in order to reflect general deterrence of a very significant degree. When the activity is engaged in for profit over a significant period of time and with a large number of transactions, the prior good character of the offender is of less significance than might otherwise be the case: R v Huang; R v Siu at [36]. 

7. Knowledge as to the illegality of the conduct is clearly a matter that increases the seriousness of the offence.

87In the present case, the offence charged against the respondent was a very serious one by reason of the following factors:

1. The period of the respondent's offending (1 January to 24 October 2008 - a period of ten months).
2. The fact that there were 24 payments totalling $357,568.00.
3. The offence involved a significant degree of planning undertaken by the respondent.
4. The respondent's role involved her undertaking a number of acts including the planning and commission of the fraudulent lodgements of income tax returns, the creation and opening of seven bank accounts to receive and transfer the money, her unauthorised use of names, tax file numbers and other identifying details of twenty-one tax payers without their knowledge or permission.
5. The financial benefit directly derived by the respondent.

(c) Comparison to R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; 174 A Crim R 370

88In determining whether the respondent's sentence was manifestly inadequate, it is useful to begin with a consideration of Siu. The offender pleaded guilty to an indictment that between 6 May 2003 and 14 July 2003 he dealt with money and intended that money become an instrument of crime, namely an offence against s 31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth). At the time of the dealing the value of the money was $556,400.00 contrary to s 400.4(1) of the Code.

89The facts of the matter were that between 6 May 2003 and 14 July 2003 the offender conducted 59 structured transactions. He approached the Commonwealth Bank and the Westpac Bank at various branches in and around Sydney, depositing amounts just less than $10,000.00. The total amount was transmitted to Hong Kong bank accounts. The motive was financial but it is noted that the respondent received a total fee of something less than $3,000.

90The offender's role was not complex. He was told what to do by the principal, although he knew he was involved in an illegal activity. He was 64 years of age and was on a disability pension. He had limited English and poor health so that prison would be harder for him than for a healthy younger man, his family resided interstate, and he had a poor criminal record for illegal activities in relation to the abalone trade. He pleaded guilty at an early stage and originally gave assistance to police. He was given a discount of 35% for the guilty plea, remorse and subjective cooperation. However, general deterrence was said to be a ""very important consideration"": at [15]. The primary judge ultimately sentenced him to a term of 2 years 11 months imprisonment with release on recognizance after 12 months.

91This Court concluded in the Crown appeal in that case that the sentencing judge erred in considering the offender's conduct as ""one of the least serious"" that could be encompassed by the section. 

92On appeal it was noted that the offence involved over half a million dollars and was committed for profit. It was observed that his offending was ""very substantial criminal activity and warranted a severe deterrent sentence"": at [46]. 

93On re-sentencing the Court's approach was that the lower sentence available within the range should be adopted, as it was a Crown appeal in accordance with the then provisions governing Crown appeals. The Court considered that a preliminary head sentence of 8 years imprisonment reflected the seriousness of the offending: at [44], [47]. The mitigating factors warranted a discount of no more than 35%, which reduced the offender's head sentence to 5 years imprisonment. This was said to be ""the very least that could be imposed upon Siu"" to reflect his criminality: at [47]. A non-parole period one third of the head sentence was said to have been manifestly inadequate to reflect his criminality and the significance of general deterrence. Accordingly, it was held that the offender should serve a minimum of one half of the head sentence, that is, two and a half years imprisonment. The Court observed:

""The starting sentence before applying discounts should have been at least 8 years although we believe a more appropriate starting point was between 9 and 11 years. As this is a Crown appeal, we have adopted the lower sentence in the available range. The respondent was entitled to a discount for the plea of 25 per cent. The Judge also gave the respondent the benefit of a 10% discount for past assistance. A total discount of 35 per cent was overly generous ... But we are prepared to grant him the same discount. The head sentence should have been at least 5 years ..."": at [47].

94The difference between Siu and the respondent in the present appeal include the following:
1. The respondent is younger (presently aged 37 years) and is a relatively healthy person; 
2. Whilst the respondent directly benefited from the money obtained from the offence, Siu's financial benefit was less than $3,000; 
3. Siu entered a plea of guilty and showed remorse, whereas the respondent was found guilty at trial and has not shown remorse. 
4. The value of the money at the time of dealing in Siu was greater than that received by the respondent ($556,400 as against $357,568).

(d) Comparison to R v Foster [2008] QCA 90; 183 A Crim R 437 

95The offender, Mr Foster, pleaded guilty to an offence of money laundering under s 400.4(1), relating to him bringing money into Australia that was the proceeds of crime.

96The offence was committed between 2 August and 14 October 2006. He was sentenced to 4 and 6 months imprisonment to commence from his detention in custody on 5 February 2007, which included a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months. He was ordered to pay reparation in the sum of AUD $214,138.47. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence and reparation order contending that the sentence was manifestly excessive and that the reparation order should not have been made.

97The offender was aged 44 and 45 during the period of the offending. He had a relevant criminal history from the UK and USA. He had negotiated a loan to develop land in Fiji with the Bank of Federated States of Micronesia. This loan was to be used only for the development. Between 4 August 2006 and 13 October 2006 the bank acted upon Mr Foster's email requests to make a total of nine payments to entities purportedly performing work on behalf of the development company, Kai Viti Liku Beach Ltd. None of the entities had in fact performed any work in respect of a particular development within the terms of the loan agreement.

98The evidence established that the applicant had arranged for the amount of $306,722.58 (that is, $50,846 less than the amount involved in the present appeal), knowing it was the proceeds of crime, to be transferred into the relevant Australian bank accounts. His offending involved nine transactions in a period of a little over two months. Only AUD $92,634.11 was returned to the bank. The offender's enterprise was said not to have been a sophisticated enterprise, in contrast, for example, with Siu, who was involved in a sophisticated enterprise, although Siu's role was not complex, and he was told what to do by his principal: at [43]. McMurdo P (with whom Mackenzie AJA and Chesterman J agreed), stated that the applicant's offending was in some ways unsophisticated in that its ultimate discovery was inevitable:

""61. ... It was, however, sufficiently devious to allow him to bring into Australia over a few months a great deal of money fraudulently obtained by him from an apparently regionally significant financial institution. General deterrence and, because of Mr Foster's concerning prior criminal history for offences of dishonesty, individual deterrence, were important considerations when determining the appropriate sentence for an offence against s 400.4. 

62. A sentencing court should have regard to the circumstances of the offence from which the offence was directly or indirectly realised. Also relevant is the amount of money involved, the offender's state of belief or knowledge, and the relevant maximum penalty. The present offence was not the most serious example of laundering more than $100,000. The money was not obtained through organised crime which directly put people's physical well-being at risk such as terrorism, drug dealing, trafficking in people or child prostitution. The offence nevertheless had serious aspects. It involved defrauding a bank associates with a developing Pacific nation of a large amount of money, over A $300,000. As the learned primary judge recognised, parliament and the courts regard knowingly transferring money the proceeds of crime into Australia as serious anti-social behaviour. Mr Foster's present offending can rightly be categorised in this way.""

99McMurdo P stated that the primary judge had carefully assessed all relevant factors, observing: 

""Although it was not necessary to adopt the mathematical approach taken at first instance, his Honour's reasoning process was transparent and unflawed. The sentence imposed, four and a half years imprisonment (discounted by 35 per cent from the seven years he would otherwise have imposed) with release after 50 per cent (that is, after two years and three months) appropriately balanced the various competing considerations. The sentence is not manifestly excessive"": at [64]. 

100The starting point for the sentence was accordingly 7 years before the discount of 30% was applied. 

101In determining the sentence, McMurdo P observed:

""In any case, it will ordinarily be relevant in determining the appropriate sentence to consider how the money dealt with is proceeds of crime, for example whether it was obtained by organised criminal activity such as drug-dealing, people-trafficking, child prostitution or terrorist-related activities. Also relevant will be the extent of the offender's belief as to or knowledge of how the money is proceeds of crime"": at [60].

102In Foster it was observed that the money was not obtained through organised crime which directly put people's physical wellbeing at risk, such as drug dealing and other activities referred to in the passage quoted above, but the offence nevertheless had serious aspects, in particular, it involved defrauding a bank. Similar observations may be made about the case the subject of the present Crown appeal. 

103There were mitigating factors in Foster, which included the offender's guilty plea at an early stage and that he was serving his imprisonment in protective custody because of prior cooperation with the authorities. There were also some ""redeeming features"" including his support of his elderly mother and his sister who were both ill, as well as his generosity to individual Pacific Islanders.

(e) Comparison to Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 269 ALR 115

104The offender in Jimmy relied upon two grounds of appeal. The first alleged miscarriage of justice on the basis of alleged disparity with sentences imposed upon the applicant's co-offenders. The second asserted error in setting the non-parole period at two-thirds of the head sentence. In that case, the ""dealing with money"" to which the charge related involved 27 occasions in the period 26 November 2003 to 11 February 2004 when the offender took a sum of cash to a bank and arranged for it to be transferred to a bank account in Hong Kong. On each occasion the amount transferred was, deliberately, less than $10,000. The total amount remitted was $243,952 (that is, $113,612 less than the amount of $357,568 involved in the respondent's offence in the present appeal).

105The activities of the offender were part of a much larger money laundering operation that was organised in Australia by a Mr Chen. The sentencing judge found that there was no evidence that the offender had any knowledge that the money was the proceeds of illegal activity on the part of Mr Chen. However, a finding was made that the offender knew that the activity he himself was carrying out was illegal. 

106The agreement the offender had with Mr Chen was that for every $10,000 he remitted he would be paid $80. That meant he would gain approximately $2,000. He did not receive cash in hand - the money went towards reducing a $5,000 debt the offender owed Mr Chen. The offender was 43 years old at the date of sentence and was 37 and 38 at the time of offending. He had no prior convictions. A finding was made that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. He had demonstrated remorse both in evidence and in his earlier actions in offering assistance. 

107The offence involved 27 transactions, all except four involved an amount of $9,000 or greater, but less than $10,000. The transactions were carried out between 26 November 2003 and 2 February 2004. The transactions were carried out at nine different bank branches. On any day when the offender carried out more than one transaction, he went to a different bank for each of the transactions. 

108For each of the transactions except one he used a name that was not his own. He used a total of seven different false identities. In relation to some of those transactions in assumed names, the offender had provided false identity documents to the bank officer concerned. In relation to each transaction, the offender placed a signature on the form that made application for the money to be transferred to the Hong Kong account, and gave the incorrect details concerning the transferor. 

109The sentencing judge sentenced the applicant in that case to a term of imprisonment of 3 years 3 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years 2 months. His Honour found that the relevant starting point, before discounts were allowed for the offender's early plea and assistance, was a head sentence of 7 years. 

110The contrasting facts in Jimmy and the present Crown appeal include the amount of money involved ($113,612 less than that involved in the respondent's offending), that Jimmy was not acting as a principal but at the direction of Mr Chen, that the amount of financial benefit received was modest compared to the amount obtained by the respondent in the present appeal, and that Jimmy had no prior convictions, had shown remorse, and had good prospects of rehabilitation.

(f) Comparison to Ungureanu v R [2012] WASCA 11; 272 FLR 84

111The offender appealed against the sentence he had received for money laundering offences, contending the trial judge had not adequately taken into account the degree to which he had co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offences. 

112The offender pleaded guilty to one count contrary to s 400.4(1) of the Code and one count under s 53(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth).

113The sentencing judge sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment on count one (the offence contrary to s 400.4(1)) comprising a term of 7 years imprisonment. This term was imposed after an unqualified discount for plea and co-operation, with a non-parole period of 4 years. 

114Investigations indicated, and it was alleged, that between 29 April 2008 and 2 May 2009, by some 65 separate transactions through a number of different financial institutions in and around Perth, the appellant was involved in remitting more than $500,000 overseas, using false identities. A finding was made that the appellant was involved in sending approximately $500,000 overseas as charged. 

115The offender pleaded guilty to one count contrary to s 400.4(1). There was a dispute at trial as to the quantum of money personally dealt with and the number of occasions involving the offender. He claimed he had personally only handled cash in 15 of the 65 transactions. On sentence, the sentencing judge doubted his evidence and found that he was ""deeply involved in these matters"". He was not the person in charge, but he was ""in the thick of it all"", that is, ""with respect to $500,000 worth of business"" and ""on the basis of being part of a joint criminal enterprise"".

116The observations made in the decision relevant to sentence, not the subject of challenge in the appeal, were directed to the following: 

1. The multiplicity of the transactions and the duration of the conduct, which constituted the subject offence as a serious example of the type of the offence admitted. 
2. The facts of the case revealed a high degree of criminality and the appellant had a deep involvement in that criminal conduct. 
3. A guilty plea was entered, although not at the earliest reasonable opportunity. The guilty plea was to be given some weight. 
4. Although the appellant had no prior history of the type of offending in question, he had been subjected to two substantial terms of imprisonment previously, making both personal and general deterrence important considerations. 

117The sentencing judge considered the amount of money involved, the multiplicity of transactions, and the duration of the conduct involved, noting that the relevant period was between 29 April 2008 and 2 May 2009. The sentencing judge found the offence under s 400.4(1) was a serious example of the type of offence admitted. His Honour also found that the offender was deeply involved in the criminal conduct. 

118The offender was sentenced to an effective term of 7 years imprisonment for the count under s 400.4(1). Whilst the discount is not specified in the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Western Australia, it is clear that the criminality of the offending in Ungureanu was at a higher level than that in the present appeal. 

(g) Unexplained leniency

119To recapitulate, the respondent was convicted by jury after a twenty day trial of a single count of dealing with the proceeds of crime, being money in excess of $100,000, contrary to s 400.4(1) of the Code. The sentencing judge found that there were 24 tax returns, lodged in the names of 21 victims, resulting in the payment of some $357,568 to the respondent. The refunds were deposited into seven bank accounts at the same bank in the respondent's name, to which she was the sole signatory, a week or so after lodgment. Nine of the refunds had been lodged by telephone, and there was evidence that it was the respondent's voice recorded on those calls, sometimes (where the impersonated taxpayer was male) using a deeper tone. The sentencing judge said that one witness who knew the respondent ""had no doubt whatsoever"" that it was her voice. The sentencing judge found, with respect correctly, that the jury's verdict entailed that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of those matters. 

120The sentencing judge concluded that ""this was objectively a very serious offence"". His Honour observed that the respondent was the principal offender, a significant beneficiary, had lodged the false income tax returns personally, had been motivated out of greed rather than need, and had caused a severe and distressing impact on the twenty-one victims. He was sceptical of aspects of the psychological evidence on which she relied, noting that many aspects (including the loss of her three children from her care, and the AVO made for her protection) occurred after the offending conduct, and that the respondent had failed to establish that anxiety, depression, gambling, drug addiction or any cognitive deficiency played any part in the offending conduct. Rightly, his Honour regarded the respondent's lack of remorse or contrition even after conviction as ""a worrying feature"". Almost all of the relevant matters in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (notably, paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (j), (k), and (m)) pointed towards a relatively severe sentence, against which must be balanced what the sentencing judge identified as ""some prospects"" of rehabilitation (s 16A(2)(n)). The sentencing judge had regard to her history of conviction for offences involving dishonesty. The sentencing judge applied s 17A, and was satisfied that no sentence other than one of imprisonment was appropriate in the particular case; no challenge was made to that conclusion, not could any such challenge properly be made.

121And yet the sentence imposed was for 3 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months. The maximum penalty was 20 years' imprisonment. The sentencing judge was taken to the decisions considered above where the objective and subjective circumstances exhibited similarities to those in this case, and where sentences twice or three times as long had been imposed. The sentencing judge was also taken to decisions where comparable sentences had been imposed, but in which the objective and subjective circumstances were very different.

122Nothing in the sentencing judge's reasons explains the relative leniency of the sentence imposed compared to the ""yardstick"" of the maximum penalty: cf Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [31]. As the Crown put it on appeal, ""the matter was one which was virtually devoid of mitigating circumstances of any kind"". Nothing in the sentencing judge's reasons explains the relative leniency of the sentence imposed compared to the decisions considered above, in light of the seriousness of the respondent's criminality. 

123This therefore is a relatively rare case where, to restate the language in a famous appeal as to sentence, an appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the sentencing discretion, although it does not appear how the primary judge reached the result embodied in his order: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. When the sentence imposed is considered in light of the circumstances of this offending and the personal circumstances of this offender, the conclusion that the sentence was manifestly inadequate is unavoidable. This sentence must have been the result of some misapplication of principle, even though where and how that occurred is not apparent from the sentencing judges' statement of reasons: see Wong at [58]. In short, we are satisfied that ""something wrong has in fact occurred"": Barbaro v The Queen [2014] HCA 2 at [27].

(h) Respondent's oral submissions

124No range? Against that conclusion, the respondent said, first, that there had only be a relatively small number of laundering offences dealt with by appellate courts, by reference to R v Wing Cheong Li [2010] NSWCCA 125; 202 Crim R 195 at [40], such that there was no ""range"". But the inference that the discretion has miscarried does not turn on the existence of a range, particularly where, as here, s 400.4 is broadly drafted and applies to a wide range of conduct. Moreover, the sentence imposed by this Court neither permits nor requires a determination of the bounds of the range within which it should fall: Barbaro at [28].

125Thorn and Schembri. Secondly, the respondent maintained that the decisions in this Court of Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294; 198 A Crim R 135 and Schembri v R [2010] NSWCCA 149; 78 ATR 159 ""put an end to any submission"" that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.

126The respondent's submission that Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294, where the applicant was resentenced to a term which would have been 3 years, 6 months before discount, with a non-parole period of 2 years, 8 months, was in many respects similar to this case, cannot be accepted. The respondent also relied on Schembri v R [2010] NSWCCA 149; 78 ATR 159, which was said to be in many respects on all fours with this case. That, too, cannot be accepted.

127Thorn was concerned with one count of dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.4(1) of the Code, 11 counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage contrary to s 134.2(1) of the Code and one count of attempting to obtain a financial advantage (the attempt offence). The overall sentence imposed was 5 years, 4 months with a non-parole period of 3 years, after a 30 per cent discount for plea and assistance. The offences concerned false GST refund claims totalling $295,201.45. For reasons explained, the offence was considered to be a highly technical breach of s 400.4, with little benefit to be gained from considering the cases mentioned or the statistics indicating the range of sentences imposed for such offences. In the result, it was concluded that this was an offence towards the lowest range of the type of offending covered by the section.

128It was concluded that the appellant had not been sentenced for the fraud offences in accordance with law, which required that he be sentenced for each offence individually and that it then be determined whether those sentences should be concurrent or cumulative. In the result, he was resentenced to a term of 4 years, 2 months, after a 25% discount, with a non-parole period of 2 years, 4 months. This also does not assist the respondent in this case, given the very different circumstances and grounds of appeal here under consideration. Here the nature of the respondent's offending is very serious, unlike the low range offending which arose for consideration in Thorn.

129It follows that it is not necessary to consider the correctness of what was observed in Thorn at [31], where it was observed that ""the activity came within the scope of the offence under s 400.4, because the offence is so widely drawn. But it was a highly technical version of the offence."" 

130In Schembri the applicant had been found guilty by a jury of 9 counts of obtain a financial advantage by deception (s 134.2(1) of the Code); six counts of attempt to obtain a financial advantage by deception (the Criminal Code Act, ss 11.1 and 134.2(1)); and one count of deal with proceeds of crime (count 17 of the indictment) being $100,000 or more (s 400.4(1) of the Code). The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 7 years from 20 October 2008 to 19 October 2015, with a non-parole period of 4 years from 20 October 2008 to 19 October 2012.

131The only ground pressed on appeal related to the sentence imposed in relation to count 17 (which related to using the proceeds of the funds obtained as the result of nine other accounts). The Crown conceded in relation to that offence that the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence that was not wholly concurrent with counts 1 to 15. In the result a sentence the 2 years imprisonment was made wholly concurrent with the other sentences.

132That decision did not support the case pressed for the respondent. There the Court observed:

""11 Count 17 charged the applicant with a money laundering offence which arose out of the same facts as the other offences with which she was charged. There have been at least three cases before the Court in the last year where the Court has criticised the prosecution practice of charging offenders in this way. To the credit of the Crown Prosecutor in this case, he brought those cases to our attention and made the concession to which we have referred. 

12 The problem was adverted to in Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294, when Howie J pointed out that money laundering offences were intended by the legislature to be directed at activity where persons were intimately involved in dealing in money that was the result of some other person's criminal activity, so as to hide its source. 

13 Shortly after Thorn, this Court delivered its decision in Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58. In that case, the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to six offences contrary to the provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (the decoder offences) concerning the sale of, or offering to sell, unauthorised decoders. The relevant provisions of that Act were ss 135ASB(1) and 135ASC(1). The applicant also pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to the Criminal Code Act, s 400.6(1). That section is concerned with dealing in the proceeds of crime. The decoder offences each carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. The offence of dealing in the proceeds of crime carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The applicant, on a plea of guilty, was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment of 3 to 6 years, to be served by way of periodic detention, on the copyright offences. Relevantly for present purposes, however, on the money laundering offence, he was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment. 

14 The Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Rothman JJ) referred first to Thorn and noted, at [14], that there was a basis in that case for the money laundering charge: 

""... because it captured criminality of the applicant's co-offender, who had never been charged and yet was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with the applicant.""

15 The Court then stated, importantly, at [17]: 

""We appreciate that a person can by the one act commit two offences and, where the two offences address different aspects of the criminal conduct, there is nothing wrong with prosecuting the two offences or, subject to the principle of totality, with imposing separate sentences for the two offences. But in our view the receipt of the money as a result of the sale did not result in a separate act of criminality that warranted a separate charge and a separate penalty.""

16 Those remarks apply in this case to count 17. However, it is important to re-emphasise this Court's disapproval of such prosecutorial action. The Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that he has brought this issue to the attention of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. We note that the charges in this case were laid and the trial conducted and sentences passed well before the decisions to which we have referred were given. Nonetheless, the matter is of such importance that we consider a copy of these remarks should be brought to the attention of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.

133The term of the sentence imposed for count 17 was not in issue on this appeal. What was common ground between the parties, which was accepted by the Court in the above context, was that the sentence imposed for that count should have been made wholly concurrent with the sentences imposed for the other offences. These are circumstances far removed from what arises to be considered on this appeal.

134Accordingly, Thorn and Schembri are far removed from the present appeal, which concerns a prosecution on a single count of money laundering.

135Low degree of criminality having regard to elements of the offence? Thirdly, the respondent focussed attention on the definition of ""deals with money or other property"" in s 400.2, which extends to concealing, disposing, importing and exporting money or other property. It was said that the criminality involved in this appeal was merely withdrawing money using an ATM card, and that in particular this was ""not a situation where this respondent provided comfort to a criminal enterprise"". That submission does not advance the matter.

136The respondent ""received"" money, ""possessed"" money, and ""engaged in a banking transactions"" relating to money which was, to her knowledge, the proceeds of crime. Providing comfort to a criminal enterprise is not an element of the offence created by s 400.4. Moreover, the considerations to which the respondent points do not detract from the deliberate, sustained, wilful conduct engaged in by the respondent over a relatively lengthy period of time. It was also said that there was ""no hiding, as it were, no facilitation of crime"", which submission sits ill with the respondent's decision to operate no fewer than seven separate bank accounts with the same bank over the ten month period in question, into which (according to the Crown's submissions, to which the respondent did not demur) she caused 3, 3, 1, 6, 1, 6 and 4 refunds to be deposited respectively. 

137Choice of charge? Finally, it was said that the difficulty arose in this case because ""the Crown chose not to charge the respondent under the tax fraud legislation"". This last submission echoed one recorded by the sentencing judge in his remarks, namely, that Ms Ly could have been charged with offences under s 134.1 of the Code (defrauding the Commonwealth) which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. But that submission was, as it was put by the Crown in reply, a submission ""into the very territory that Elias forbids a court to go"". The High Court has made it clear that consideration of different offences for which the offender might have been convicted is merely a distraction: Elias v The Queen [2013] HCA 31; 248 CLR 483 at [36], and that it risks compromising the court's impartiality and independence to sentence by reference to an uncharged offence which the court considers the prosecution should have charged: Elias at [35].

138As discussed in R v Wing Cheong Li; Wing Cheong Li v R at [41]:

""Notwithstanding the gridlike structure of the subsections, their graded component parts and maximum sentences, they comprehend such a wide range of criminality that there is bound, I think, to be an appreciable variation in the length of sentences within and between them. It seems to me, without undervaluing the importance of the principal differentiating factors - minimum value of money or property and state of mind - that each case will have other variables that bear on sentence. Perhaps the most important will be an exact appreciation of what the offender did, what acts he performed and with what authority and over what period of time. The total value of money or property involved will be important, and whether the money or property belonged to the offender or to another. The degree of planning or deceit that led to the commission of the offence and whether actual loss resulted, and the extent of such loss, will be important. Just as there is a distinction between recklessness and belief, the precise nature of proved belief may vary so as to affect the sentence. There will be a range of possible strengths of belief, rising to certain knowledge, as in Maldonado. Here the respondent's serious criminality was revealed by the number of the frauds involved; the amount of the money the subject of those frauds; the impact of the frauds; the planning and steps involved; the purpose of the frauds; and the actual loss which resulted.""

139We have concluded in light of the terms and structure of the Code and the reasoning underpinning the sentence in each of the above comparative cases that the sentence imposed in the present case of 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 4 months was manifestly inadequate. 

The Residual Discretion

140In determining a Crown appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, the Court has a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 at [1]-[2].

141The onus lies upon the respondent to establish that the discretion should be exercised in his or her favour: R v Smith [2007] NSWCCA 100, [60]; R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [110]. 

142There was no evidence sought to be adduced on re-sentencing on behalf of the respondent (cf Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 243 FLR 28 at [162]-[180], [274]-[282] and [315] and R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 169 at [101]-[105]). The Crown appeal was filed promptly after sentence. There is no basis not to exercise this Court's residual discretion in a Crown appeal.

Resentencing

143The objective factors involved in the respondent's offending plainly constituted the offence under s 400.4(1) a very serious one. This conclusion is based upon the amount involved in the dealing, namely, $357,568, the period of time over which the offending took place, the deliberate pattern of offending, the significant financial benefit derived by the respondent, and the lack of any significant mitigating factors. 

144In our assessment, the respondent's criminality in relation to the offence pursuant to s 400.4(1) is somewhat above the mid range of objective seriousness. Like the primary judge, we are of the view that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate: Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 17A(1). The psychological evidence supports an extended period of parole supervision. Having regard to the matters in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act addressed earlier in these reasons, we are of the sentence which is appropriate in all the circumstances of this offence is a term of imprisonment of 8 years comprising a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months with a balance of term of 3 years 6 months. 

145We therefore make the following orders:
1. Appeal allowed. 
2. The sentence of imprisonment in respect of the offence pursuant to s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) imposed by the District Court with effect from 2 November 2012 be set aside. 
3. The respondent be re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 8 years to commence on 2 November 2012 and to expire on 1 November 2020, with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to commence wtih effect from 2 November 2012 and to expire on 1 May 2017. The earliest date upon which the respondent is eligible for release is 1 May 2017.

2763934,Application by HJWG pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 505,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1HJWG (""the applicant"") makes an application pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Act"") for an inquiry into the sentence imposed upon him by English DCJ in respect of:
(i)two offences contrary to s. 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (""the Act"");
(ii)one offence contrary to s. 61M(2) of the Act; and
(iii)one offence contrary to s. 66A of the Act.
2The offences contrary to s. 61M(1) each carried a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment, and prescribed standard non-parole period of 5 years.
3The offence contrary to s. 61M(2) carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, and a prescribed standard non-parole period of 5 years.
4The offence contrary to s. 66A carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, and a prescribed standard non-period of 15 years.
5The overall term of imprisonment imposed by her Honour was one of 11 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 8 years.  On 1 April 2011 the Court of Criminal Appeal granted the applicant leave to appeal, but dismissed his appeal (see HJWG v R [2011] NSWCCA 50).
6The applicant has submitted that the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.   In making the application, the applicant has argued that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, namely that the sentence imposed upon him was infected by error in light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
7The principles which apply to an application such as this are set out in full in The Application of Victor Makarov pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 NSW [2013] NSWSC 1468 at [5] to [6].
THE APPLICANT'S SENTENCE8In sentencing the applicant her Honour made reference to the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods which applied to each of the offences (at ROS 2).  It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that it was ""arguable"" that in stating that the standard non-parole period applicable to the offence against s 61M(2) was 8 years imprisonment rather than 5 years, her Honour had erred.  In FD v R [2013] NSWCCA 139, with the concurrence of Simpson J and Harrison J, I set out (commencing at [10]) the legislative history which resulted in the standard non-parole period applicable to offences against s. 61M(2) being increased.  In light of that legislative history, I am not satisfied that her Honour erred in the manner for which the applicant has contended.    
9Having recited the facts (which need not be canvassed for present purposes) her Honour (commencing at ROS 9) set out the applicant's subjective circumstances before returning (commencing at ROS 11) to the objective seriousness of the offending.  Her Honour concluded that two of the offences fell above the mid range of objective seriousness, whilst two fell below that point.  In reaching those conclusions, her Honour did not expressly refer to the decision in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 which, at the time, governed the approach to be taken in respect of sentencing in respect of offences for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed.
10In the Court of Criminal Appeal, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Johnson J and McCallum J agreed) concluded (at [14]) that her Honour had erred by failing to properly detail her findings as to the objective seriousness of each offence (see R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110 at [89]).  However, his Honour was not persuaded that such error justified the Court's intervention.  In particular his Honour said (at [13]):
""The approach which her Honour took to these findings was essentially the same approach which she took in R v McEvoy where Simpson J in this Court described her Honour as making an error of process (R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110 at [89]). Her Honour's decision in the present matter was handed before the judgment of Simpson J was published in McEvoy. 
[14] Her Honour should have provided greater detail with respect to her findings. To merely indicate that the offence fell above or below the midrange is insufficient. However, as will be apparent from these reasons I am not persuaded that error justifies the intervention of this Court.""
THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES11It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had, in accordance with the decision in Way (supra), given primary or determinative significance to the applicable standard non-parole periods and that her approach to sentence was therefore erroneous in light of the subsequent decision of the High Court in Muldrock (supra).  It was further submitted that the Court of Criminal Appeal had been required to decide whether or not the sentences were manifestly excessive, and that consideration of that question had also been undertaken in accordance with Way (supra).   
12It was submitted that the case constituted a ""clear example"" of both the sentencing judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal adopting an approach which, although correct at the time, was later found by the High Court in Muldrock (supra) to be erroneous.  
13It was submitted on behalf of the Attorney-General that a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance could not arise by reference to a Muldrock - type error.  However, as Johnson J pointed out in The Application of Joy Lorraine Knight pursuant to s. 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act [2014] NSWSC 285 at [17] such a submission cannot be sustained in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Sinkovich v Attorney-General of NSW [2013] NSWCA 383.  
14The Attorney-General also relied upon the fact that in dealing with cases involving so-called Muldrock error, the Court of Criminal Appeal has emphasised that the fact that Way was wrongly decided does not mean that all sentences passed before Muldrock, relying upon the decision in Way, are necessarily vitiated by operative error (see Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [2]; Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26]; Achurch v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 117 at [73]; [110]; and [161] to [162]).  It was submitted that as a consequence of such emphasis, it was necessary to read the relevant judgment(s) as a whole and that when the matter was approached in that way, it was evident that the standard non-parole periods had been used by both the sentencing judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal as a benchmark.  It was submitted that in these circumstances, no sense of unease or disquiet concerning the sentences which were imposed reasonably arose. 
CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION15In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded (at [25]) that it was an error to categorise s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") as being framed in mandatory terms, which required a sentencing judge to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for determining whether an offence was appropriately assessed as being in the middle of the range.  
16The Court also concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period, and held that the correct approach was to identify all relevant factors (including any prescribed standard non-parole periods) and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence.  
17Further, (at [28]) the Court specifically rejected the adoption of a two stage approach to sentencing, which commenced with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, and which was followed by an inquiry as to whether there are matters justifying a non-parole period which is longer or shorter than that prescribed.  
18In arriving at these various conclusions, the court held that Way (supra) had been wrongly decided.
19In my view, there is nothing in the remarks of the sentencing judge which indicates that she gave primary or determinative significance to the standard non-parole periods.  Further, there is nothing which would suggest that her Honour adopted a two stage approach to sentencing.  On the contrary in my view, a reading of the sentencing remarks (particularly at ROS 9 to 11) supports a conclusion that her Honour identified all of the relevant factors in determining the appropriate sentence.  
20In the Court of Criminal Appeal McClellan CJ at CL found (at [13]) that her Honour had erred in failing to properly detail her findings as to the objective seriousness of each offence.  His Honour then said (at [24]):
""I have previously indicated the sentences which were imposed for the individual offences. The aggregate term of imprisonment was 11 years with an effective non-parole period of 8 years. In large part the overall sentence is a result of the standard non-parole periods which the legislature has provided in relation to the individual offences. The sentence for count 2 dominates the effective sentence. This was inevitable given the nature of this offence, the sentence for which is not individually challenged.
21His Honour concluded (at [35]):
""In these circumstances I am not persuaded that the penalty for the individual offences or the effect of the extent of concurrency provided is excessive to the extent that this Court should intervene. The sentences imposed were severe but not manifestly excessive when the prescribed standard non-parole periods are considered.""
22Although there were various references by his Honour to the applicable standard non-parole periods (for example at [25], [28] and [31]) those references do not, in my view, indicate that in reaching his conclusions his Honour gave those non-parole periods primary or determinative significance.  In my view, when the judgment is read as a whole, it is evident that the standard non-parole periods were used, in each case, as a guide or a benchmark.  That was perfectly permissible.
23In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that any Muldrock type error has been made out.  Accordingly, I do not entertain any doubt or question as to the existence of a mitigating circumstance in the applicant's case.
ORDER24For the reasons given I make the following order:  
1.The application is refused.**********

		20 May 2014",2014-05-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763936,Kemp v KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 586,"Judgment
1By a Summons filed on 12 July 2013, in proceedings numbered 2013/212114, Peter Stewart Kemp (""the prosecutor"") charges KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd (""the Company"") with an offence contrary to s 55(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (""RTG Act"") in that:
""Being the loader of goods onto a combination for transport by road within the meaning of s 20 of the RTG Act, in that on 14 July 2011, on the Mitchell Highway, one kilometre west of Bradwardine Road near Bathurst in the State of NSW, a breach of a load restraint requirement occurred, namely, clause 62(2) of the Road Transport (Mass Loading and Access) Regulation 2005 ('MLA Regulation'), when part of the load of five prefabricated steel beams fell from the combination and collided with six motor vehicles travelling in the opposite direction, causing the death of Leonie Darling, an appreciable risk of harm to public safety and a serious risk of harm to road infrastructure.""
2The Company, as the loader of the goods, has pleaded guilty to that charge.
3By a Summons filed on 12 July 2013, in proceedings 2013/212122, the prosecutor charges the Company with an offence contrary to s 53(1) of the RTG Act in that:
""Being the consignor of goods within the meaning of s 20 of the RTG Act, in that on 14 July 2011 on the Mitchell Highway, approximately one kilometre west of Bradwardine Road near Bathurst in the State of NSW, a breach of a load restraint requirement occurred, namely, clause 61(2) of the MLA Regulation, when part of the load of five prefabricated steel beams fell from the combination concerned, and collided with six motor vehicles travelling in the opposite direction, causing the death of Leonie Darling, an appreciable risk of harm to public safety and a serious risk of harm to road infrastructure.""
4The Company, as consignor, has pleaded guilty to that charge.
5The Company now stands to be sentenced for these offences.  The maximum penalty for each of these offences is determined by reference to the categorisation of the offence as being either minor, substantial or severe, as those terms are used in ss 59 and 60 of the RTG Act.
6Here, both the prosecution and the Company agree that each of these offences is properly to be categorised as a severe breach of the statutory requirements.  Accordingly, the maximum fine that can be imposed for each offence is 250 penalty units which amounts to $27,500.  
7Each of these offences fell within the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court of NSW.  Section 180(1) of the RTG Act specifically provides that these offences can be prosecuted summarily before the Local Court.  
8Whilst this Court undoubtedly has jurisdiction to hear and determine these charges, it is generally inappropriate for a prosecutor to engage the summary jurisdiction of this Court to deal with offences of this kind, where the maximum penalty is well within the jurisdiction of the Local Court.  These charges could have been, and should have been, dealt with in the Local Court.
Principles of Sentencing
9The imposition of a sentence in this case, calls up the common law principles relating to sentencing, and various statutory provisions.
10The Parliament of NSW has set out the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender including a company.  Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that those purposes are:
""(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence;
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences;
(c) to protect the community from the offender;
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender;
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions;
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender;
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""
11It is self evident that these purposes overlap, may be in conflict, and cannot be considered in isolation, one from the other in their application to a particular case. These purposes do not rank in any order of priority.
12The terms of s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, mean that the Parliament has preserved the entire body of judicially developed, or common law, sentencing principles: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [56]-[57], Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [18].  These common law principles have been developed over time by courts to provide guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every judge.  The principles are to be found in decided cases. 
13This is a case where, given the nature of the offence and the fact it occurred on a public road, the principle of general deterrence must play an important but necessarily proportionate, role.  In these circumstances, the proper punishment of the Company will operate as a general deterrence for other companies who consign and load goods onto heavy vehicles for transport on the public roads of NSW from committing breaches of transport legislation, in particular of load restraint requirements, and thereby enhance road safety.
The Facts
14The parties have agreed on a set of facts which describe the conduct of the Company, the offences and their consequences.  Although I am not bound to accept these agreed facts, in this case I do so, insofar as I set out the facts below:
""1. At all material times Robert John Walker (d.o.b: 30 Jan 1952) of 32 Cusack Street Wangaratta Victoria was the sole director and 50% shareholder of Robbie Walker Transport Operations Pty Ltd (ACN 078 993 012) ('RWTO').  The registered office and princip[a]l place of business of RWTO is located at 18 Baker Street, Wangaratta Victoria.
2. RWTO operates as a transport company.  At the material times RWTO directed the operations and controlled the movements of heavy vehicle combinations owned and registered to a related entity, Robbie Walker (Wangaratta) Pty Ltd (ACN 005 963 084).
3. At the material times RWTO was responsible for the control and direction of a heavy vehicle combination which consisted of a white Iveco MP4700 'cab over' prime mover Victorian registration WRV 989 and a flat-bed extendable 1999 Haulmark trailer registration 436 89S ('the Vehicle').  Both components of the Vehicle were registered to Robbie Walker (Wangaratta) Pty ltd.
4. KGB Protective Coatings Pty Ltd (ACN 75 125 773 220) ('KGB') is a company which is engaged in the activity of applying protective coatings to metal structures.  It has a facility located at 140 Bulls Garden Road in Gateshead, a suburb of Newcastle.
5. In late 2010, KGB was engaged by SinoStruct Pty Ltd (ACN 128 995 764) ('SinoStruct') to provide respraying of coatings to structural steel components.  The components were being shipped from China to the port of Newcastle on behalf of SinoStruct.
6. The components were intended to form part of a screening and ore crushing facility being built by SinoStruct under contract to a division of Newcrest Mining Limited in relation to the Cadia East mining project.   The Cadia East project site is located approximately 25 kilometres from Orange in New South Wales.
7. The first shipment of components was delivered in November 2010.  Components which arrived undamaged were transported by road directly from the port of Newcastle to the Cadia East project site.  In the event that the components had been damaged in transit, Mr Philip Terrible, a representative of SinoStruct, would arrange for the components to be transported to KGB for respraying, prior to despatch to the Cadia East project site.
8. In July 2011, a shipment of components had arrived at the Newcastle wharf.  A number of the components were required to be resprayed due to damage incurred in transit.  On 13 July 2011, Order Number 876496 was raised by SinoStruct with KGB in relation to respraying of the damaged components.  That Order described the work required as 'Rework 7PKS + 2 Flat Racks'.
9. During shipment from China the steel components were packed in a steel 'cradle'.  In the course of being reworked at KGB, it was necessary for the steel components to be unpacked from the cradle, and the loads subsequently re-assembled for road transport.
10. On 13 July 2011, a number of components had been resprayed at KGB and were ready for transport.  That load consisted of three large steel beams and two shorter sections of steel fabrication ('the Load').   Those components, and their dimensions and mass were identified as follows:
I. 3313C3068514.17 metres in length x 3 metres wide3.4 tonneII. 3313C3066010.45 metres in length x 4 metres wide3.4 tonneIII. 3313c3069214.45 metres in length x 1 metre wide4.4 tonneIV. 3313FR30652 (x2)2.34 metres x 2.3 metres wide530kgs....
17. On the morning of 13 July 2013, staff employed by KGB were involved in assembling the components of the Load.  The process involved the components being initially assembled onto trolleys.  The Load would then be lifted by the use of a crane owned by K[GB] and operated by KGB staff.
18. KGB staff assembled the Load in the following order:
Beam I (3313C30692) was placed at the bottom of the Load.Two lengths of metal 'I' beam were placed on top of Beam IOff-cuts of carpet were placed between Beam I and the metal 'I' beams and on top of the metal 'I' beamsBeam II (3313C30660) was placed next on topLengths of hardwood 'dunnage' were placed on top of Beam IIOff-cuts of carpet were place[d] under and over the hardwood dunnageBeam III (3313C30692) was placed next on topThe two smaller frame pieces 3313FR30652 (x2) were loaded on top of Beam III
19. At around 3.00pm the Vehicle arrived at KGB.  4 pieces of softwood dunnage onto the deck of the trailer.  The dunnage pieces measured approximately 100 x 150 mm in cross section and were approximately 2 metres long.  The softwood dunnage was supplied by RWTO and consisted of Radiata pine.  One of the pieces of softwood dunnage included a defect known as a sap inclusion.  That defect was not obvious except on close inspection, but did have the impact of reducing the load bearing capacity of that dunnage.
20. Staff employed by KGB with [the driver] proceeded to place the Load onto the trailer of the Vehicle. The trailer was backed under the Load which was lowered onto the deck of the trailer.  This process was completed by KGB staff by carrying out the following tasks:
Operating two 10 tonne cranes at the KGB premises;Supplying and placing the steel 'I' beams, carpet offcuts and hardwood timber dunnage. Assisting the driver to place lights along the LoadStanding on top of the Loan and passing chains over the Load
21. The KGB staff who placed the Load onto the Vehicle were under the supervision of KGB.  KGB staff were not trained in load restraint.  KGB staff did not measure the dimension of the Load. 
...
23. On 13 July 2011 Delivery Docket 2852 was produced by KGB nominating the delivery address as 'SinoStruct'.  The Delivery Docket stated:
'Please receive in good order and condition the under mentioned goods:3 x beamsC30660C30685C3069SFR 30652 (x2)'
...
25. Upon leaving the KGB premises at Gateshead Newcastle, the Vehicle was driven to Dunedoo where the driver rested overnight.  .  
26. On 14 July 2011, the Vehicle transported the Load by road from Dunedoo to Bathurst via Mudgee and Rylstone.  During this part of the journey the Load was observed by a number of witnesses to protrude from the side of the Vehicle.
27. At approximately 8.30am on 14 July 2011, the Vehicle was travelling westwards on the Mitchell Highway at a location approximately 1 kilometre west  of the Bradwardine Road west of Bathurst towards Orange when part of the Load fell from the Vehicle and collided with six vehicles travelling in the opposite direction.
28. As a result of the Load falling from the Vehicle, Ms Leonie Darling was killed, and six vehicles and the road surface were damaged.
29. Subsequent to the incident it was discovered that the softwood dunnage supplied by RWTO had compressed under the weight of the Load, and one piece had failed completely due part of the Load being placed directly into contact with the sap inclusion.""
Specific Statutory Considerations
15In imposing a penalty for each of these offences, there are a number of specific statutory provisions to which it is necessary to have regard.  
16The first of these is clause 61(2) of the Road Transport (Mass Loading and Access) Regulation 2005 (""MLA Regulations"").  That clause provides that a load on a vehicle or trailer 
""... must be secured so that it is unlikely to ... be dislodged from the vehicle.""
17As well, s 60 of the RTG Act is also relevant.  It is in the following form:
""60 Matters to be taken into consideration by courts (1) The purpose of this section is to bring to the attention of courts the general implications and consequences of breaches of mass, dimension or load restraint requirements when determining the kinds and levels of sanctions to be imposed.(2) In determining the sanctions (including the level of fine) that are to be imposed in respect of breaches of mass, dimension or load restraint requirements, a court is to take into consideration the classification of the breach under this Part and, having regard to that classification, the following matters:(a)  minor risk breaches ... (b)  substantial risk breaches ... (c)  severe risk breaches involve one or more of the following:(i) an appreciable risk of harm to public safety or theenvironment,(ii) a serious risk of accelerated road wear,(iii) a serious risk of harm to road infrastructure,(iv) a serious risk of increased traffic congestion,(v) a serious risk of diminished public amenity,(vi) a serious risk of unfair commercial advantage....""
18As Price J said in Roads & Traffic Authority NSW v Fletcher International Exports Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 936; (2008) 51 MVR 41 at [40]:
""40 The purpose of s 60 is to bring to the attention of courts when considering an appropriate sentence the consequences of a failure to comply with a breach of mass, dimension or load restraint requirement. The matters to which a court is required by s 60(2) to have regard depends upon the classification of the risk breach as a minor, substantial or severe. The matters which a court is required to consider by the Legislature for a severe risk breach are necessarily very different to those for a minor risk breach. The requirement that regard be had to an appreciable risk of harm to public safety is exclusive to sentencing for a severe risk breach: s 60(2)(c)(i). For a severe risk breach it is the seriousness of the risk which distinguishes those matters detailed in subparagraphs (ii)-(vi) from the matters to be considered for a substantial risk breach: s 60(2)(b)(i)-(v). Nothing in s 60 affects any other matter that a court may consider when sentencing an offender such as s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which sets out the purposes for which a court can impose a sentence and s 21A of the same Act which provides for aggravating and mitigating factors.""
19Because I am imposing a sentence for a severe risk breach, I am obliged to, and will, have regard to each of the matters in s 60(c)(i)-(vi) inclusive, insofar as they are presently relevant.  As I see it, the matters within that section which are of particular relevance are:
(a)an appreciable risk of harm to public safety as was demonstrated by what in fact occurred;
(b)a serious risk of harm to the road infrastructure as occurred when the load, having fallen off the truck, damaged the road itself, and which may have, but fortunately did not occasion any damage to other roadside infrastructure;
(c)the serious risk of traffic congestion caused by the happening of either of the two events to which I have just made reference or, alternatively, if the load shifted in the course of transport.
20As well, the provisions of s 177 of the RTG Act which deal with double jeopardy are also relevant.  I will discuss that section in more detail later in these sentencing remarks.
21The provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 must also be taken into account.  Section 21A(2) provides for matters which are regarded as aggravating factors to be taken into consideration when imposing a sentence.  Here, relevantly, s 21A(2)(g) requires the Court to take into account, as an aggravating factor, that the injury, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial.  There is no doubt that those consequences of this offence were substantial.  The loss of the life of Ms Darling, is the most serious consequence of this offence.  
22The Company argues that it cannot be held responsible for the death of Ms Darling, whose car was struck by the load after it shifted and fell from the vehicle.  I accept that the Company alone did not cause the death of Ms Darling, however, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the failure by the Company in either of the capacities in which it was charged, caused the death of Ms Darling.  If the load had been properly secured, such that it was unlikely to fall, as the legislation required, then Ms Darling's death would not have happened.  I will have regard to Ms Darling's death and the damage caused to other motor vehicles as an aggravating factor as I am required to do by s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) Act.
23Section 21A(3) of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) Act requires the Court to have regard to particular factors as mitigating the offence.  In accordance with that section, here, I have regard to:
(a)s 21A(3)(e), that the Company does not have any record of previous convictions; and
(b)s 21A(3)(k), that the Company has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity.
24The provisions of s 21A(3)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, have the effect that, that the Company is remorseful and as provided for in s 21A(3)(i), is unlikely to offend again, then they are matters which can be taken into account by way of mitigation when considering the appropriate penalty to be imposed.  It will be necessary to consider whether this is so in due course.  
25Since the Court is imposing a fine on the Company, s 6 of the Fines Act 1996, requires the Court to consider such information as is provided about the means of the Company to pay the fine.  The Company has tendered a financial statement to 30 June 2013.  In that year, the Company's gross income exceeded $3 M.  After taking into account the cost of sales, direct expenses referrable to the sales made, and more general expenses, the Company was left with an operating profit of a little less than $85,000.  At the end of that year the Company had current assets of a little over $740,000 and, ultimately, had a net asset position of a little under $170,000.  
26I am not satisfied from a consideration of this material, that the Company lacks the means to pay any fine which may imposed.  Nor am I satisfied that any fine which may be imposed would have any significant adverse financial impact on the commercial operations of the Company.  I do not propose to regard this factor as having any significant weight in assessing the appropriate fine to be imposed.  
Plea of Guilty
27An offender, such as this Company, which pleads guilty to the offences charged, is entitled to a discount with respect to any penalty which is imposed so as to recognise the utilitarian value of the plea to the administration of justice in NSW.  It is accepted by the prosecution that the Company has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and, accordingly, is entitled to a full discount of 25% on any penalty which the Court would otherwise have imposed.  
Unlikelihood of Reoffending
28The Company did not file any affidavit evidence from anyone associated with, or connected to it, with respect to the events the subject of the offence.
29The Company tendered what it described as its ""new procedure"" for loading contractor vehicles for transport.  Counsel for the Company submitted that this new procedure demonstrated that the Court should find that the Company is unlikely to breach its road transport obligations in the future.  
30Careful attention to the detail of the procedure which is contained on a single page, leads me to the conclusion that, rather than addressing any steps which the employees of the Company could, or might, take to avoid vehicles loaded by it, or consigned by it, being in breach of road transport legislation when the vehicle leaves the Company's premises and drives onto the public roads, the protocol in fact directs employees of the Company to refrain from being involved in any loading procedure.  
31Paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of the document directly relate to not taking any action and, in essence, seek to ensure that the Company no longer undertakes loading, and thereby avoids any responsibility, at all, for the restraint of a load on any vehicle which leaves the Company's premises.
32I am not satisfied that paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of the document suggest that the Company, or its employees, thereby discharges all of its legal obligations.  I do note that, contrary to the apparent position at the time of these offences, the new procedure requires employees to be given a copy of, and trained in the use of, the load restraint guide.  
33I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities, that this new procedure will avoid any conduct which may constitute the one or more offences in the future.  It may provide a basis for the Company being able to mount a defence to any allegation that it has been in breach of its obligations as created by the statute, but I am not persuaded that such steps as have been taken to rectify the procedure which previously existed, will mean that the Company is unlikely to commit any further offences of the kind with which it is charged. 
Remorse
34It is appropriate under s 21A(3)(i) of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act to take into account in mitigation of the offences, that the Company has expressed remorse for its conduct.  Except for the plea of guilty to the offences, there is no evidence that the Company has accepted responsibility for its actions, nor has the Company, other than by its plea, acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by its actions; nor is there any evidence that it has made any reparation for such injury, loss or damage as the statute requires.  I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the mere entry of a plea indicates any remorse on the part of the Company. 
35I am not satisfied that the Company is entitled to any mitigation by reason of any expression of remorse or any demonstration of remorse with respect to these offences.  To the extent that the plea of guilty constitutes a demonstration of remorse, that demonstration is adequately allowed for in the discount allowed for the plea of guilty.
Double Jeopardy
36Section 177 of the RTG Act is in the following form:
""177 Double Jeopardy
(1) A person may be punished only once in relation to the same failure to comply with the particular provision of the Road Transport legislation, even if the person is liable in more than one capacity.  
(2) Despite subsection (1), a person may be punished for more than one breach of a requirement where the breaches relate to different parts of the same vehicle, or combination.""
There is no suggestion that subsection (2) applies here.  
37It is to be observed from the Summonses that the prosecutor charges the company in almost identical terms with committing an offence either under s 53 of the RTG Act or s 55 of the RTG Act, because the failure alleged is that it was in breach of cl 61(2) of the MLA Regulations.  That clause requires that a load be secured in a manner which means that it is unlikely to dislodge.  The operative facts here depend upon the load falling from the vehicle, and the consequential conclusion that the load was not secured as required by cl 61(2) of the MLA Regulations.  Intentional is not a relevant factor.
38The separate offences with which the Company is here charged, relate respectively to it, in its capacity as the consignor and also in its capacity as a loader, but the operative facts are, in substance, the same.  
39Counsel for the prosecutor submits that s 177 has no application to the proceedings here.  Counsel for the defendant submits that although the company has properly pleaded guilty to both offences, the Court is prohibited from imposing more than one penalty.
40There is no authority directly on the proper interpretation of s 177 of the RTG Act.  In Palfrey v South Penrith Sand & Soil Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1357, Barr AJ was considering a question of whether the charging of a company with offences against the Road Transport legislation in more than one capacity constituted an abuse of process.  He was not dealing directly with the issue of the imposition of more than one penalty.
41At [49] his Honour turned his attention to s 177.  He said this:
""49 As I observed earlier, Mr Hatcher submitted that s 177 of the Act prevented the entry of conviction for more than offence in the example I have used. I doubt whether that is so. The parties made no reference to authority about the meaning of double jeopardy as used in the Act's introduction to that section. Subs (1) is not easy to understand. It speaks of a person's being ""liable"" in more than one capacity. The liability must be ""in relation to the same failure..."" but whether the section refers to a liability to be convicted or merely a liability to be prosecuted in more than one capacity is not clear. At any rate, the section is clear when it states that a person may be punished only once. If the Parliament had intended the person to be convicted only once it would have presumably had said so. Accordingly, I do not think that s 177 is a bar to the bringing of multiple charges in the examples I have used.
50 However, I am of the opinion, that it is an abuse of process to charge the company in these several ways when there is a single underlying event and only one sentence can result. The prosecutor's practice in the framing of all the outstanding summonses has produced waste and expense.""
42It is to be observed that his Honour regarded the section as being applicable, at the stage of imposition of penalty rather than at the stage of the charging by a prosecutor of a defendant with more than one offence.
43The ratio decidendi of his Honour's decision is to be found in [49], in the last sentence, namely, that s 177 is not a bar to the bringing of multiple charges.  However, his Honour's remarks, which are to be found in the next paragraph, namely that when there is a single underlying event, only one sentence can result, although obiter dicta, are the carefully considered expression of a view with respect to the proper application of s 177 of the RTG Act in circumstances similar to those which here exist.  
44The prosecutor submitted that because the charges were framed with respect to separate sections of the RTG Act, there was no occasion to conclude that there was a ""same failure"" to comply with a particular provision of the Road Transport legislation, because each section of the Act was different and, accordingly, there was no room for the phrase ""same failure"" to operate in these circumstances.  
45Counsel for the defendant submitted that the expression ""same failure"" should be interpreted in the circumstances of this case to apply to the core allegation of a failure, or breach, which has given rise to both offences, and which, here, is the failure to comply with the provisions of cl 61(2) of the MLA Regulation.
46Having regard to the terms of the Summonses, and the particulars provided as to the conduct which it is alleged constituted the offences, in the context of the use of the words ""even if the person is liable in more than one capacity"" at the end of s 177 of the RTG Act, in my view, the proper conclusion to be reached is that, contrary to the submissions of the prosecutor, the provisions of s 177 of the RTG Act have application here.  Accordingly, the Court is constrained from imposing more than one penalty.  This decision is consistent with the judgment of Barr AJ in Palfrey.
47The breach of the Road Transport legislation, namely, that the load was not properly secured, is identical with respect to each of the two offences.  The only difference between the offences is the capacity in which the Company is charged - in one offence as the consignor, in another offence as the loader.
48In those circumstances, I am abundantly satisfied that s 177 of the RTG Act has application.
49I should say that the prosecutor conceded that, even if his submission be correct, and that s 177 of the RTG Act did not apply, nevertheless the Court, by having regard to the common law principle of totality in sentencing, and the decision of the High Court of Australia in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, would reach a conclusion in the circumstances of these two offences, such that it would be inappropriate to impose a full fine with respect to each of the two offences as though they were entirely separate.  
50The prosecutor accepted in his submissions that if the Court was to impose a full penalty with respect to one offence, then it should only impose a nominal penalty with respect to the second offence.  This, counsel for the prosecutor submitted, would be a sufficient way of recognising that there was similarity of conduct by the Company which was reflected in the two separate charges.
51The effect of this submission, if I had accepted it, which I do not, is that it would only have lead to the imposition of a nominal penalty by way of a fine which would not have exceeded $1,000, with respect to the second offence.  
Seriousness of Offence
52It is appropriate to make an assessment of the seriousness of the offence, and the Company's conduct.  This assessment arises from the nature and circumstances of the offence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27].
53I am satisfied that the events underlying each offence which are substantially identical, amount to a serious example of a severe risk breach of a load restraint offence.  The load which was being moved was a very large and heavy one, consisting of significant steel structural components for the mine infrastructure.  The distance being travelled, from Newcastle to about 25km south of Orange via Dunedoo, Mudgee and Rylstone, amounted to hundreds of kilometres.  The route taken included travelling significant distances along main roads, which might reasonably be expected to be carrying a substantial volume of traffic.  The vast bulk of the journey was carried out over roads which are used by traffic, and could not be considered to be remote or unused roads.  
54As a matter of fact, the load restraint failure caused the death of Ms Darling, an entirely innocent road-user who was complying with all of her obligations.  The resultant collision involved all six vehicles, and a significant disruption to a major highway serving western NSW.
55The Company's responsibility for the event which transpired cannot be said to be a stand alone one.  Nevertheless, it was a central role.  The Company was the consignor of the load, it was involved in determining what components would be loaded onto the vehicle and whether, having seen the vehicle which arrived at its premises, that vehicle would be loaded with the components for the trip to the environs of Orange.  Its staff were then involved by operating two cranes in loading the vehicle and assisting in securing it.  It did so with staff who were not trained in load restraint.  
56I have concluded that these circumstances all combine to show that these are very serious offences, and are offences which fall at the upper end of the range of seriousness.
The Company's Circumstances
57The Company has taken some steps to apparently address the deficiencies which it says led to the events in question.  As I have earlier remarked, whilst steps have been taken, I have not been satisfied on the balance of probabilities that these steps will necessarily prevent any further offence.
58This has been a timely response by the Company to the events which have occurred, but that response has its limitations.
59I note, and take into account, that the dunnage which appeared to be appropriate, was defective in a latent way in the sense that the defect was not obvious without a close inspection.  I also take into account that the defective dunnage was not supplied by the Company.
60However, except for the agreed facts, and the new procedure document, I have no other evidence which explains, from the company's perspective, how the offence came about.  I can only conclude that there was a failure by the Company to address its legal obligations with respect to load restraint.  
61I also note, and take into account, that the Company has agreed to an order of the Court that it pay the legal costs of the prosecutor in the sum of $25,000.
Penalty
62In considering the appropriate penalty to be imposed, it is necessary to keep in mind that the proper interpretation of s 177 of the RTG Act which, in my view, requires me to impose a penalty for only one of the two offences.  
63I do so with respect to the offence of loading, which is contained in Summons No. 2013/212114.  I have particular regard to the seriousness of the offence, and the need for general deterrence in light of the risk to public safety involved in such a breach of the Road Transport legislation.
64Without regard to any discount for the plea of guilty, I would have imposed a fine for the loading offence of 220 penalty units.  I acknowledge that this fine approaches the maximum of 250 penalty units, but in fixing that sum, the approach reflects my conclusion of the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, taken together with all of the other factors, including the Company's circumstances.  
65However, this notional penalty is to be reduced because of the entirely appropriate discount for the early plea of guilty.  Accordingly, I have determined that the proper penalty to be imposed on the Company with respect to the loading offence is 165 penalty units.
66With respect to the second offence of the Company as a consignor, which is set out in Summons No. 2013/212122, I intend to record a conviction for the Company committing the offence, but in light of my conclusions with respect to s 177 of RTG Act, I refrain from imposing a penalty.
Sentence and Orders
67I make the following orders:
In proceedings 2013/212114:
(1)I convict KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd of an offence contrary s 55(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005.
(2)With respect to that offence, I impose a fine of $18,150.
(3)I order KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd to pay the prosecutor's costs in the agreed sum of $25,000.
In proceedings 2013/212122:
(4)I convict KGB Protective Coating Pty Ltd of an offence contrary to s 53(1) of Road Transport (General) Act 2005.
(5)I otherwise dismiss the Summons.

5The applicant has submitted that the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.   In making that application, the applicant has argued that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, namely that the sentence imposed upon him was infected by error in light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
6The principles which apply to an application such as this are set out in full in The Application of Victor Makarov pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 NSW [2013] NSWSC 1468 at [5] to [6].
THE APPLICANT'S SENTENCE7In sentencing the applicant (R v RHB [2007] NSWSC 1466) Hall J stated (commencing at [100]):
""[100] The application of the standard non-parole period was discussed by this Court in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, in particular at 183-193.
[101] I have had regard to all the circumstances to which I have referred in determining whether a lesser or greater non-parole period should be applied to this case. I have concluded that the standard non-parole period to which I have referred should be applied.
[102] In determining whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, I have had regard to the objective seriousness of the offence in the light of the facts which relate directly to its commission, and to the circumstances of aggravation and of mitigation as listed in s. 21A(2) and (3). In relation to the objective circumstances it is apparent that the standard non-parole of 20 years does apply to this case. The factors to be taken into account in that respect include the fact that the victim of the offence was a very young child who was vulnerable and that the offender abused his position of trust and authority in relation to the victim. They also include the factual circumstances surrounding the offence and the other matters to which I have referred including the issue of premeditation and the subjective factors, as earlier discussed.""
8The judgment of Hall J was the subject of appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal by both the applicant and the Crown (see Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v RHB [2008] NSWCCA 236).
9The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the applicant's appeal, but dismissed that brought by the Crown against the asserted inadequacy of the sentence imposed.  The basis on which that decision was reached is set out in the judgment of Basten JA (with whom Hislop J and Price J agreed) commencing at [44]:
""44 In the present case, it is not possible to reconcile his Honour's conclusion that the standard non-parole period should be set and the conclusion that there were no special circumstances warranting an increase in the balance of the sentence beyond one-third of the non-parole period with the imposition of a sentence of 30 years imprisonment. It would not have been inappropriate for the inconsistencies to have been corrected on the application under s 43 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. However, that step not having been taken, this Court must intervene to pass that sentence which is warranted in law and should have been passed: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3). 
45 With respect to the Director's appeal, there is force in the submission that this case fell above the middle of the range. That the victim was an infant; that the respondent had prior knowledge of the potentially fatal consequences of violent behaviour towards an infant; the likely effects on the family generally; that the child was in his care; the absence of any explanation or circumstances mitigating culpability are all factors tending to support that conclusion. 
46 Nevertheless, were it not for the inconsistency, the Director's contention with respect to the application of the standard non-parole period would not be upheld. Although there are features which suggest that the murder was a very serious offence, similar features will arise with respect to many murders. It is significant that in Merritt Wood CJ at CL described a number of factors as tempering the objective criminality: these were not mitigating factors, but an absence of certain aggravating circumstances. Some of those applied in the present case; others did not. Against the characterisation of the offence as being in the high range, were the lack of planning and the appearance of a spontaneous and impulsive act resulting from an unexplained rage, the lack of any gratuitous cruelty or prolonged suffering and the absence of sexual gratification. On the other hand, there was no psychological evidence of depression or other psychiatric disorder; although he did not seek to conceal the consequence of his conduct, he did not accept his guilt and, as already noted, there was a prior instance of similar violence. 
47 The unchallenged conclusion reached by the trial judge was that this case did not fall within s 61 of the Sentencing Procedure Act so as to warrant a sentence of life imprisonment. On the other hand, the adoption of the standard non-parole period was consistent with a sentence in excess of 20 years imprisonment. 
48 It seems likely, in relation to murder, that the middle of the range of objective seriousness must be seen to encompass a variable set of circumstances and an assessment, based on no precise criteria, which will allow a broad discretion to the trial judge. In assessing objective seriousness, it must be borne in mind that the range will not include the most extreme cases which warrant the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment. Further, it must be borne in mind that the 20 years standard non-parole period is not applicable in relation to a range of murders involving other circumstances of aggravation identified in the Table to Division 1A. 
49 In considering whether to intervene on the basis that the standard non-parole period was manifestly inadequate, some weight can be given to the circumstances of imprisonment, as revealed by the fresh evidence because, even if the trial judge had reached the conclusion that the precondition to the imposition of a standard non-parole period identified in s 54A was satisfied, it would still be necessary to consider whether factors subjective to the offender and unrelated to the offence warranted a different non-parole period. Evidence of particularly harsh conditions of imprisonment would be relevant at that stage. The likelihood is that the respondent will suffer a degree of severity in the conditions of his imprisonment beyond that faced by most of the prison population for a significant portion of his sentence. 
50 In combination, these reasons require rejection of the Director's appeal with respect to the imposition of the standard non-parole period. 
51 The next question is whether the balance of the term for the sentence of murder should constitute one-third of the standard non-parole period or a lesser proportion. (There being no finding of special circumstances, it cannot result in a higher proportion.) 
52 It is true that his Honour indicated an intention that the non-parole period for the offence of murder should be 80% of the term of the sentence: at [106]. That was not a statement of intent, but a statement of fact. In its terms it was in error. Nevertheless, it was only marginally in error, arithmetically, if one took account, not merely of the sentence with respect to the murder, but the cumulative non-parole period of 24.5 years, as compared with the 30 year sentence of imprisonment for murder. More importantly, his Honour gave no reason for decreasing the proportion of the balance of the term below the statutory maximum of one-third. Such a calculation was open in the absence of special circumstances, but some justification might have been expected. As this Court is now re-sentencing the respondent, the appropriate course is to impose a sentence with the addition of one-third of the standard non-parole period, to give a term of sentence of 26 years eight months. 
53 To take that step necessarily involves upholding the respondent's cross-appeal with respect to the term of the sentence for murder.""
THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES10It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that Hall J (particularly at [100] and [101]) had given the standard non-parole period determinative significance, and had engaged in a two-stage process of sentencing.  It was submitted that in light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock (supra) such an approach reflected error.  It was further submitted that the Court of Criminal Appeal had adopted the same erroneous approach.     
11It was submitted on behalf of the Attorney-General that a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance could not arise by reference to any Muldrock type error.  However, as Johnson J pointed out in The Application of Joy Lorraine Knight pursuant to s. 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act [2014] NSWSC 285 at [17], such a submission cannot be sustained in light of the decision of Court of Appeal in Sinkovich v Attorney-General of NSW [2013] NSWCA 383.  
12It was further submitted on behalf of the Attorney-General that although Hall J had made reference to the decision in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 in sentencing the applicant, it was clear from a reading of the whole of the remarks on sentence that his Honour had used the standard non-parole period as a benchmark or guideline, rather than as a starting point or a determining factor.
13Counsel for the Attorney-General acknowledged that when the matter was before the Court of Criminal Appeal it had been accepted by both parties that Hall J had been required to sentence the applicant in accordance with the decision in Way (see [26]).  However, it was submitted that the Court had approached the application of Way with ""due sensitivity to the complexities of applying the standard non-parole period as a benchmark"", and had appropriately balanced each of the relevant objective and subjective criteria in dismissing the Crown appeal and in determining the appropriate sentence.  It was submitted that there was nothing in the judgment of the Court which suggested that the standard non-parole period had been impermissibly used, or that the Court had engaged in a two-stage process of sentencing.
CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION   14In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded (at [25]) that it was an error to categorise s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as being framed in mandatory terms which required a court to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for determining whether an offence was appropriately assessed as being in the middle of the range.  The High Court further concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period, and that the correct approach in sentencing for an offence for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed was to identify all relevant factors (including any prescribed standard non-parole period) and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence.
15Further, (at [28]) the Court rejected the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing, which commenced with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, and which was then followed by an inquiry as to whether there were matters justifying the imposition of a non-parole period which was longer or shorter than that prescribed.
16In arriving at these various conclusions, the High Court held that Way (supra) had been wrongly decided.
17In my view, there is little doubt that Hall J sentenced the applicant according to the decision in Way, and therefore in a manner which the High Court has since concluded was incorrect.  In particular, it is evident from his Honour's observations at [101]-[102] that he posed the question of whether there were circumstances which warranted a departure from the standard parole period.  
18I am mindful of those authorities which make it clear that in determining whether a Muldrock - type error is established, sentencing remarks are to be read as a whole (see for example Black v R [2013] NSWCCA 265).  However, even giving full allowance to that factor it is clear, in my view, that his Honour used the applicable standard-parole period as a starting point in determining an appropriate sentence, before asking whether or not there were factors which justified a departure from it.  
19In the Court of Criminal Appeal Basten JA pointed out that Hall J had not made an express finding that the offending fell within the middle range of objective seriousness.  However, the fact remains that Hall J posed the question (at [101]) whether there were matters justifying a departure from the prescribed standard non-parole period.  That, in my view, reflects the fact that his Honour gave at least primary, and possibly determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period.  This is so, notwithstanding his Honour's subsequent reference (at [103]) to the applicable mitigating factors.  
20It follows that in my view, Hall J approached the sentence of the applicant in a manner which the High Court subsequently concluded was erroneous.  
21As I have previously noted, in the proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeal the Director of Public Prosecutions accepted that Hall J's approach had been in accordance with Way (per Basten JA at [26]). However, it does not follow from such an acceptance that the Court of Criminal Appeal adopted that same approach in determining an appropriate sentence.  On the contrary, it is evident from the judgment of Basten JA (particularly at [46], [48] and [49]) that his Honour had regard to all relevant factors, and used the standard non-parole period, not in a determinative way, but as a guide.  There was nothing impermissible in such an approach.    
22In these circumstances, I am unable to accept the submission that there is any doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, the existence of which warrants a referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
ORDER23For the foregoing reasons I make the following order:
1.The application is refused.

		20 May 2014",2014-05-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763938,Sales v R [2014] NSWDC 280,"Judgment


	
	On 5 August 2013 I delivered a judgment adjourning Mr Sales’s sentence appeal. I imposed certain conditions for the adjournment. The adjournment was under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Not all of the conditions have been fulfilled for various reasons but I am satisfied that Mr Sales has demonstrated that he is intent on rehabilitating himself.
	
	
	Mr Bladwell, who appears for him today, pointed to the fact that his client had not re-offended and was in a steady relationship. His client has also secured employment and had maintained reasonable contact with the Probation and Parole Service. There was good reason for him at not attending Alcoholics Anonymous. As Mr Bladwell said his client has accepted the opportunity which I have offered him. Mr Bladwell informed me that his client spent about 10 months and two days in custody and proposed that I should dispose of the appeal by altering the sentences in various respects and withdrawing one of the appeals.
	
	
	Mr A Cheung, who appears for the Respondent to the appeal - the Director of Public Prosecutions - acknowledges fairly that a case has been made out for Mr Sales’s sentences to be suspended. He referred me to the Probation and Parole Service and more recent compliance. He realistically accepted that compliance was not perfect but the discrepancies were explained. The compliance was reasonable.
	
	
	For these reasons I propose to allow Mr Sales’s appeals and to in effect impose an 18 months suspended sentence. I will do that by making the following formal orders.
	
	
	Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) I determine these appeals against sentences in the following ways.
	
	
	As for exhibit A concerning the offence under s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), I vary the sentence in the following respect. I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for nine months and I direct that Mr Sales be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for nine months. I will set out the conditions later on. In respect of the offence against s 156 of the Crimes Act I make the same order except that the sentence is 18 months and that will be suspended. In respect of the offence against s 192E(1)(a) I note that that appeal has been withdrawn and I give leave for it to be withdrawn.
	
	
	Turning to exhibit B, in respect of the offences numbered 1 to 3 against s 192E(1)(a), in respect of each offence I determine the appeal against sentence by varying the sentence. In respect of each sentence, it is varied by reducing it from four months to three months to date from 24 April 2013 until 23 July 2013. In respect of the offences numbered 4 to 5 against s 192E(1)(a), I determine the appeals against sentence by varying the sentences. Each sentence is reduced to three months commencing 24 April 2013 and expiring 23 July 2013. In respect of the offence against s 189 of the Crimes Act, I vary that sentence under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act by suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for six months and directing Mr Sales to be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for 6 months. I make the corresponding orders for the two remaining offences on exhibit B, a further offence under s 189 of the Crimes Act and an offence against s 112 (1)(a) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The conditions of the good behaviour bond will be these:
	



	
	That Mr Sales be of good behaviour.
	
	
	That he inform the Registrar of the District Court at Gosford of any change in his residential address.
	
	
	That he attend court if called upon to do so.
	
	
	That he accept supervision from Corrective Services Community Corrections and any reasonable recommendation or direction from an officer of that service including the following specific four areas: referral to Community Corrections programs aimed at relapse prevention, further direction and monitoring of attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous, monitoring of employment, monitoring of relationship and financial status.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now gentlemen, I think that disposes of it. I have taken those four topics from the most recent pre-sentence report.

EXHIBIT #C PRE-SENTENCE REPORT DATED 12/05/14 TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTION.

HIS HONOUR: Now my associate will go and type up those orders. She’ll type them up here and now and then she’ll print them and bring them back and I’ll have to ask you gentlemen to stay because it’s a bit complicated and I want to be sure that I’ve got it right. Now Mr Sales, your client has his hand up your client wants to say something.

OFFENDER: ..(not transcribable)..

HIS HONOUR: What time?

OFFENDER: I’ve got to be there by 5.

HIS HONOUR: Where is it?

OFFENDER: I don’t know that’s the problem. I think Town Hall or something so.

HIS HONOUR: All right well we’ll probably have you away here by 4 o’clock. So you’re not far from Town Hall all right. Mr Sales your appeal has been allowed do you understand?

OFFENDER: Yep.

HIS HONOUR: And I’ve suspended most of the sentences as Mr Bladwell asked for and that’s because of what you’ve been doing since you’ve been to court. You’ve had a lot on your plate including what’s happened to your father. And it’s up to you to keep up what you’ve been doing with particularly your employment that’s very good. Are you still in that job?

OFFENDER: Yep.

HIS HONOUR: Now you probably know the effect of a suspended sentence and Mr Bladwell will explain it to you again. Have you had one before?

OFFENDER: Yeah I’ve got a good understanding about it.

HIS HONOUR: If you breach it there’s nothing much I can do. The law is really strict. It’s not like an ordinary good behaviour bond. I pretty well have to send you in. So it’s up to you. Is that your partner sitting in court there?

OFFENDER: Yep.

HIS HONOUR: The reason I’ve given you this chance is to let you get yourself your life back in order and you’re showing really good signs of that . How old are you now?

OFFENDER: 25.

HIS HONOUR: That’s what I thought. And I’m putting the community at risk. I’ve said that to you before because you’ve got a criminal record, a pretty extensive one and you’ve made a real nuisance of yourself. So it’s not just me being good hearted to you, somebody’s paying for this and that’s the community. They’re at risk of having you out there. But I’ve got some confidence that you’ll just carry on working, carry on with your relationship and get on with your life. All right, so good luck.

		19 February 2015",2014-05-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763949,"TRAN, Brendon v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 85","Judgment

1HALL J: The applicant, Brendon Tran, seeks leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court (Blackmore DCJ) on 31 May 2013.

2The application for leave to appeal was filed on 12 December 2013.

3The applicant entered a guilty plea in Central Local Court on 19 July 2012. He was subsequently arraigned in the District Court on the following three charges:

(i) Supply commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (977.7 grams), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985: maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment and/or 3,500 penalty units; SNPP 10 years.

(ii) Possess a firearm without being authorised by a licence or permit (namely a .38 revolver) contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996: maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment; SNPP 3 years.

(iii) Possess a firearm without being authorised by a licence or permit (namely a single barrel sawn off shotgun) contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act: maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment: SNPP 3 years.

4Following his guilty plea to the above offences in the Local Court, the applicant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing the above charges, at which time he requested that in being sentenced with respect to Count 1 a number of offences be taken into account on a Form 1, namely:

(i) Supply prohibited drug, N,N- Dimethylamphetamine in an amount not less than the commercial quantity (about 500g) on 3 August 2011; 

(ii) Supply prohibited drug, Methylamphetamine on 3 August 2011; and

(iii) Supply prohibited drug, Pseudoephedrine (89.3g) on 26 August 2011.

5The sentencing hearing took place on 12 April 2013. The sentencing judge had sentenced a co-offender, Lan Ngoc Ly on 13 September 2012. His Honour's remarks on sentence in that matter were part of the Crown bundle tendered in the sentencing proceedings in the present matter.

6A second co-accused, Cathy Nguyen, was also to be sentenced by the same sentencing judge on 6 September 2013. It was in respect of that co-offender's case that the applicant provided an affidavit and letter of assistance.

7On 31 May 2013, the applicant, who is now 41 years of age, was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment, pursuant to s 53A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 of 8 years commencing on 26 August 20111, comprising a non-parole period of 5 years 9 months and a balance of term of 2 years 3 months.

8As noted in the written submissions of Mr Dhanji SC, who appeared on behalf of the applicant in this Court, the sentencing judge, after indicating an aggregate sentence was being imposed, purported to set terms of imprisonment with respect to the individual counts (rather than indicating what the individual sentences would have been, had an aggregate sentence not been imposed, as required by s 53A(2) of the above Act). The individual sentences were in the following terms:

(i) In respect of the offence of supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, a sentence of 6 years 10 months comprising a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months and a balance of term of 2 years 1 month;

(ii) In respect of the above firearm offences contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act, a term of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years.

9A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered as part of the Crown Bundle at the sentencing hearing. As one of the grounds relied upon by the applicant in the present proceedings is that the sentence imposed with respect to Count 1 was manifestly excessive, I set out the following agreed facts which were contained in the Crown's Written Submissions at paragraph [5], as follows:

""Information received by Strike Force Crossbow, an Asian Crime Squad, suspected that the applicant was in Sydney to collect and transport illicit drugs to Western Australia.

The applicant arrived in Sydney on 3 August 2011 and was observed by police surveillance to meet the co-accused, Cathy Nguyen aka Thi Xuan Mai. A surveillance device recorded conversations between them. The recorded conversation related to the purchase, secretion and transport of drugs from Sydney to Perth. Subsequently 244.5g of dimethylamphetamine was located at the applicant's Sydney apartment and 27g at his Perth apartment, together with 121.4g of methylamphetamine (two of the Form 1 matters).

On Thursday, 25 August 2011 the applicant travelled to Sydney and discussed with Thi commercial quantities of drugs and handed over to her $240,000. At about 11:00pm that same day the applicant is heard discussing with Ly what she is to carry; how the excessive use of perfume would avoid detection; her conduct at the airport; that her ticket would be booked in the name of Nancy; and where the bags and drugs were to be placed on their bodies.

At about 5:00am on 26 August at Chippendale, police intercepted a taxi carrying the applicant and co-offender Ly to the airport. Ly was in possession of 737.6g of crystal meth whilst the applicant had secreted two bags of crystal meth in his underpants, weighing a total of 240.1g. The combined weight was 977.7g, which on analysis had a purity of between 78 and 79.5%. In addition, the applicant also carried 89.3g of pseudoephedrine with a purity of 65.5% (a further Form 1 matter).""

10The applicant has been in custody since the date of his arrest on 26 August 2011. He did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. Medical records concerning his wife's condition were tendered on his behalf.

The Grounds of Appeal

Ground 1: The applicant was denied procedural fairness in that the sentencing judge failed to warn the applicant's representative that he considered the objective gravity of Count 1 (the Supply charge) to be above the mid range of objective seriousness

Ground 2: His Honour erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the Count 1 (the Supply charge)

11These two grounds were argued together and it is convenient to deal with them on that basis.

12Following the hearing on 12 April 2013 the proceedings were stood over for sentence on 31 May 2013. In the Remarks on Sentence the sentencing judge stated:

""The Form 1 offences tend to prove that the offender is in fact a significant dealer in drugs who was in Sydney to top up his supplies before transporting them to Perth. His utilisation of a courier for that purpose only enhances the seriousness of his offending. It demonstrates a sophistication that he was prepared to employ in carrying out his activities. In my view, given the quantity of the drug which was close to the large commercial quantity, the amount of money paid for the drugs and the use of the courtier to transport the drugs, this offence is well above the middle of the range of seriousness for such offences..."" (at 6).

13In the course of the sentencing hearing, Senior Counsel then appearing for the applicant, Mr Boulten SC, addressed the issue of the objective seriousness of the offence the subject of Count 1 and the following exchange is recorded in the transcript of the sentencing hearing on 12 April 2013 as follows:

""BOULTEN: I'm happy to deal with whatever you want to deal with. These are serious offences and a substantial term of imprisonment is warranted. The offender was clearly involved in transactions that demonstrate substantial drug trafficking that has an interstate flavour to it or aspect to it, it is therefore accepted that his offending is quite serious. Just exactly where your Honour fits that on the scale is a matter for your Honour to determine.

HIS HONOUR: Just at first blush, just for arguments sake, had there been no plea, you might have said this was in the middle range of objective seriousness, given the quantities involved. That's how serious I think it is. Middle range of objective seriousness without a plea.

BOULTEN: Well I wouldn't argue with that.

HIS HONOUR: When you've got the 977g, almost the large commercial quantity

BOULTEN: Your Honour I'm not arguing with that.

HIS HONOUR: But obviously there is a plea and it's only one factor ...

BOULTEN: However, I accept that middle range objective seriousness is a finding open to the court..."" (at T 16).

14The applicant's submission is that the finding made by the sentencing judge as to objective seriousness was at odds with the indication given in the course of the sentencing hearing and that Senior Counsel for the applicant had expressed his acceptance that the offending was at the mid-range of objective seriousness for such offences, and no further debate then took place.

15The Crown in its submissions accepted that the finding made as to objective seriousness was at odds with the indication given by the sentencing judge in the course of the proceedings. The Crown further conceded that unfairness did arise in the circumstances, being a denial of the opportunity for Senior Counsel for the applicant to make additional submissions to the sentencing judge in opposing a sentence greater than that which had been indicated.

16A denial of the opportunity to the applicant's Senior Counsel to make submissions against a finding of objective seriousness higher than mid-range did constitute a denial of procedural fairness to him. As observed by Kirby P (as his Honour then was) in Parker v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 282 at 296:

""... Fair procedure requires, at least for important decisions and those critical to the determination of a case, that considerations of importance to the judicial officer's conclusions should be drawn to the notice of the parties affected or their representatives so that a fair opportunity is presented for contrary argument to persuade the judicial decision-maker to a different view. In the United States, there is a developed jurisprudence which would hold that a failure to disclose such thinking amounts to a departure from the requirements of procedural fairness ...""

17Accordingly, the Crown's concession in relation to Ground 1 is one properly made. That brings forward for consideration Ground 2, namely whether the sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of Count 1 (the Supply charge).

Applicant's Submissions on Ground 2

18Mr Dhanji on behalf of the applicant acknowledged the difficulty of challenging such findings in the ordinary course: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282; Boney v R [2008] NSWCCA 165: R v Bonett [2009] NSWCCA 135. However, it was submitted that the restraint referred to in those cases is not applicable in the context of this case, made as it was in the absence of submissions or argument on the subject given the sentencing judge's indication as to the objective seriousness of the offence (Count 1).

19Reference was made to what was described as the ""primary factors"" that were relied upon by the sentencing judge as recorded in the Remarks on Sentence at 6.7, namely:


The quantity of the drug;
The amount of money paid;
The use of a courier to transport the drug.

20The first of these matters was properly conceded as a matter to be taken into account but, as noted in the applicant's written submissions, that it was ""just one factor"": Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584.

21It was submitted for the applicant that the amount of money paid by the applicant to the supplier bore a direct relationship with the first matter and, in that sense, it did not of itself appreciably increase the seriousness of the offence (apart from establishing that the applicant was acting in his own right, which was not in issue).

22As to the third matter, it was submitted that this was not a case where the offender was at a position high in a sophisticated structure or organisation. To the contrary, attention was drawn to the fact that while he engaged a courier to take some of the drugs, he himself transported the remainder and that he was acting for himself as distinct from being principal in a large or sophisticated structure. Additionally, it was submitted that not only did he transport drugs in his own body, but that he allowed himself to be directly connected to the courier, the courier having a note on her when arrested with his address written on it, and the courier having an address written in his handwriting as to where she was to go to.

23These matters were relied upon to support the submission that the applicant's use of a courier, contrary to the finding made by the sentencing judge, was not particularly sophisticated.

24A further criticism made of the findings of the sentencing judge (at Remarks on Sentence 6.1), was that the applicant ""recruited and utilised drug couriers"". The evidence, it was submitted, suggested that this was the first time Ly had acted as a courier for the applicant as indicated by the instructions provided to her. Further, the applicant's discussions with Nguyen concerning the purchase of the drugs on 3 August were not in the context of an ""established arrangement"". It was submitted that the discussion appears to have been more consistent with entering into a venture (albeit one that had the potential of an ongoing relationship). It was also submitted that the purchase of the methylamphetamine on 25 August appeared to be a continuation of the arrangements put in place on 3 August.

25It was accepted that the supply on 25 August could not be seen as a ""one off"" or isolated event and the contrary had not been suggested, but that the sentencing judge went further in stating:

""The Form 1 offences tend to prove that the offender is in fact a significant dealer in drugs who was in Sydney to top up his supplies before transporting them to Perth."" (Remarks on Sentence at 6.5)

26Insofar as the remarks of the sentencing judge in this respect found that the applicant was engaged in substantial drug dealing extending beyond the charges and the Form 1 offence, it was submitted that such a finding was not supported by the evidence. Additionally, before such a finding could be made it was necessary that his Honour could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the fact. Finally, on this aspect, it was submitted that the Form 1 offences could not operate to increase the objective gravity of the instant offence.

27In relation to the matters of personal deterrence and retribution with respect to Count 1, the Form 1 matters, it was accepted, were relevant. As to specific deterrence, it was submitted this was not a significant aspect of the sentencing exercise given that the applicant had no prior record and a significant gaol sentence was inevitable. Additionally, it was submitted, his co-operation admits to willingness to cut his ties with the criminal community.

28These circumstances relied upon in respect of Ground 2, it was observed, were not put to the sentencing judge in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence given the issue concerning Ground 1.

Crown's Submissions on Ground 2

29The Crown observed that Senior Counsel for the applicant at the sentencing hearing accepted that Count 1 lay within the mid-range of objective seriousness, indicating that ""the offender was clearly involved in transactions that demonstrate substantial drug trafficking that has an interstate flavour to it or aspect to it"" (Remarks on Sentence at 16.6).

30The matters upon which, in the Crown's submission, his Honour was entitled to conclude that the offence was above mid-range included:


The quantity of 977.7g is only 22.3 short of the large commercial quantity (1000g). The maximum penalty for the present offence is one of 20 years with a SNPP of 10 years. Where a large commercial quantity is involved, the maximum penalty increases to life imprisonment.


The high purity of the drug, being 78% and 79.5% (depending on satchels), enables it to be cut to a greater extent thus increasing its street value.


The amount of money paid - some $240,000. This has a relevance in the Crown's submission to both the quantity and purity as the same quantity at half the purity would have a lesser street value because it would be cut fewer times


The offender was a principal who utilised and organised a courier for interstate trafficking. With respect to the instant offence, the applicant only carried a limited quantity of drugs in his underpants because the quantity to be carried was more than Ly could reasonably strap on.


This supply was not a ""one-off"" or isolated event.


The offence was planned and premeditated: s.21A(2)(n).

31The Crown submitted that in this case the applicant did not seem to be a street-level supplier, but was one investing a significant amount of money in purchasing almost a kilogram of the drug.

32That activity, the Crown submitted, required him to source the drug in New South Wales, travel to Sydney in early August to then confer with, and arrange a deal with his supplier (Ms Nguyen), and then to arrange a courier to travel on the same return flight in late August to effectively shield him from exposure.

33The Crown further noted that the applicant gave the courier instructions on wearing perfume to avoid detection, and how to avoid security at the airport. These features, the Crown submitted, indicate a certain sophistication in the operation conducted by the applicant.

34The Crown acknowledged that these matters were not fully ventilated on sentence because of the exchange that occurred between the Bench and the Bar table on the issue of objective seriousness and that the Crown's concessions with respect to Grounds 1 and 3 now brings the matters clearly into focus with respect to Ground 4.

35I propose to consider and deal with the competing submissions in relation to Ground 2 in the discussion below concerning Ground 4.

Ground 3: His Honour erred in sentencing the applicant on the basis that his plea of guilty was late

36This ground may be dealt with briefly. The Crown conceded error in the sentencing judge's finding on this aspect and proceeded on the basis that the applicant pleaded guilty to the offences at a late stage. It is clear from the Remarks on Sentence that his Honour, wrongly, proceeded to determine the discount for the applicant's plea upon the basis that it had been entered only in the District Court after negotiations with the Crown with respect to facts.

37As noted above, the plea was entered in Central Local Court on 19 July 2012, that is to say approximately a little over 10 months from the date of his arrest. The Crown further concedes that as a consequence the applicant would ordinarily expect to receive a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the plea.

Applicant's Submissions

38In addition to addressing the matters to which I have referred above, it was noted in the written submissions for the applicant at paragraph [32], that ultimately the sentencing judge imposed a combined discount for the plea and assistance of 42.5%. The submission was that it would appear that the sentencing judge would have allowed a discount of 50% but for the fact that his Honour regarded the plea of guilty as late. It was submitted that such a discount should be substituted for that allowed by the sentencing judge.

Crown Submission

39The Crown stated that setting the utilitarian discount for the plea at 25% raises the issue of the value of the discount for assistance. The Crown referred to the exchange between Senior Counsel and the sentencing judge on this issue as follows:

""[CROWN]: Well, the Crown's position is that your Honour's aware of the usual authorities of Ellis and Lewins, and that, essentially, a combined discount of anything over 50% would be highly exceptional. In this case, the bulk of the charges, as I've indicated, were pleaded to in the Local Court, so he is entitled to that benefit. As far as the discount for assistance goes, certainly it is of value; your Honour's heard the evidence that Ms Nguyen was positively identified by the offender. It's a case where I did have carriage of that matter, and she did waive committal in the Local Court, contesting the charges, and it was only after the matter was in the District Court that she's then changed her plea of guilty. As Mr Boulten's indicated, I've also spoken with Mr Wagstaff [the prosecutor with the carriage of Ms Nguyen's matter]. He has indicated that he is likely to call Mr Tran in the sentence proceedings against Ms Nguyen. So, there is a high degree of assistance, and, including future assistance, the Crown would say that somewhere in the region of 40% would be about the mark in respect of the combined discount.

HIS HONOUR: I think he could probably do better than that, but anyway, maybe not 50%.

BOLTEN: Well 50% is in the region of 40% and I submit that 50% is about right your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. All right, I will make a note of both those submissions."" (Proceedings on Sentence at 13-14)

40The Crown referred to the observations in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92 of Howie J at [5], namely, that a discount for a plea and assistance of more than 40% should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population.

41Reference was made by the Crown to the evidence given by Detective Sergeant Hawkins who was called by the applicant to give evidence about the nature and value of the applicant's assistance (Proceedings on Sentence at 11:44-46). Detective Sergeant Hawkins agreed that as at the date of sentencing hearing ""the offender is not currently placed on protection in prison"".

42The Crown argued that given that the combined discount afforded, the applicant already exceeded the 40% maximum spoken of by Howie J. As there was no evidence called by the applicant as to his custodial situation, the Crown submitted that it is pertinent to consider whether the 25% discount allowed for assistance would have been forthcoming had the utilitarian discount been set at 25%, for upon that point there would then have to have been some consideration of s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and its injunction that the sentence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstance of the offence. These observations, the Crown observed, do not strictly bear upon Ground 3 but arise in respect of consideration of Ground 4.

43These issues are relevant to the issue as to whether this Court should, in the circumstances of the case, exercise its power to quash the sentence imposed and to re-sentence.

Ground 4: The sentence imposed with respect to Count 1 was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive

44In the Remarks on Sentence his Honour observed:

""... In my view, given the quantity of the drug which was close to the large commercial quantity, the amount of money paid for the drugs and the use of the courier to transport the drugs, this offence is well above the middle of the range of seriousness for such offences. Of course the late plea of guilty does entitle him to a discount for any such sentence. The standard non-parole period in this case remains a guide to the sort of penalty that should be applied in cases such as this"" (at 6).

45As observed in the written submissions for the applicant at paragraph [12], whilst the prosecutor referred to the fact that the quantities of the drugs the subject of Count 1 were significant and that Count 1 involved an amount bordering on the large commercial quantity, a submission was not made that the applicant's offending was above the mid-range of objective seriousness. I further observe that the Crown did not submit that such a finding was open in this case. It is in those circumstances it was submitted that it was not surprising that the applicant's counsel did not address the matter in reply.

Applicant's Submissions

46The submission on behalf of the applicant is that the total sentence of 6 years 10 months for Count 1 is manifestly excessive and that a lesser sentence is justified and ought to have been passed.

47In that respect, it was submitted that the sentencing judge's starting point in respect of Count 1 was almost 12 years (the starting point being 11 years 10½ months), which it was argued was manifestly excessive.

48In support, the applicant relied upon the submissions referred to above in relation to Ground 2.

Crown's Submissions

49The Crown submitted that had the applicant been convicted after trial, and the offence found to have been in the mid-range of objective seriousness, then the notional starting point would have been in the vicinity of 13 years and 4 months.

50On the basis of the sentencing judge's finding that the offence was ""well above the middle of the range of seriousness for such offences"", the Crown submitted that one would expect the notional starting point on that basis to have been in the vicinity of 16 years, and yet his Honour's notional starting point was only 11 years 10½ months, a starting point below what one would have expected even in respect of a middle range offence. This, it was contended, leads to the conclusion that his Honour failed, for whatever reason, to translate his finding about objective seriousness into an appropriate starting point.

51The Crown further submitted that the ""generosity"" of the notional starting point was even more obviously decided in the applicant's favour when one considers that the notional starting point of 11 years and 10½ months was a starting point arrived at after the three matters on the Form 1, all supply charges, had been taken into account.

52The Crown additionally submitted that the three matters on the Form 1 were very serious matters. When the applicant was arrested on 26 August 2011, in addition to the 240.1g of crystal methylamphetamine in his underpants, he also had 89.3g of pseudoephedrine with a purity of 65.5% in his possession (matter 3 on the Form 1).

53With respect to matter 1 on the Form 1, it was agreed that on 3 August 2011 half a kilogram of dimethylamphetamine was purchased by the applicant from Thi and subsequently, 244.5g of dimethylamphetamine was located in the applicant's Haymarket apartment, and a further 27g in his Perth apartment. Matter 2 on the Form 1 related to 121.4g of methylamphetamine also located at the applicant's Perth apartment.

54The Crown's submission, accordingly, was that the gravity of the Form 1 matters was such that, had they been taken into account with respect to Count 1, based on the sentencing judge's finding of above mid-range objective seriousness, the notional starting point would have to be demonstrably in excess of 16 years. Thus, had a 50% discount then been applied for the utilitarian value of the plea and the applicant's assistance, the non-parole period would have exceeded 8 years.

55The Crown submitted therefore that no less severe sentence is warranted in respect of Count 1.

56The Crown also made submissions in relation to the firearm offences, both of which carried a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 3 years. Those offences were dealt with by a sentence that imposed a 2 year non-parole period on each with an additional term of 1 year, with the sentences to be concurrent. There was a 12 month accumulation on Count 1.

57An aggregate form of imprisonment was imposed of 8 years commencing on 26 August 2011, comprising a non-parole period of 5 years 9 months and a balance of term of 2 years 3 months.

Decision

58On a consideration of the relevant objective and subjective circumstances established before the sentencing judge, I do not consider that the starting point for the sentence imposed in respect of Count 1 was, as contended for the applicant, too high. The facts clearly enough establish that the offending was in the mid-range of objective seriousness and, even allowing for the applicant's subjective circumstances, I do not consider that any lesser starting point would, in this case, have been appropriate. In addition, in determining the aggregate sentence the matters on the Form 1 were serious offences, as the Crown has submitted. They, of course, were required to be taken into account when determining the sentence to be imposed: Attorney General's Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518.

59In R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, Spigelman CJ observed:

""79 Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: 'If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process'. That is not the statutory formulation. By s 6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that 'some other sentence ... is warranted in law and should have been passed'. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to 'quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore' is not satisfied. As the judgments in Dinsdale to which I have referred indicate, the exercise of the power in s 6(3) further requires the identification of error in the requisite sense.""

60Additionally to the above observations, there is a need to consider whether, notwithstanding the Crown concession in respect of Ground 3, a combined discount for the plea and assistance as high as 50% would be justifiable. Speaking for myself, I do not consider that such a combined discount could be justified upon a consideration of all of the circumstances of this case. 

61Section 23(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires a court to consider all the matters listed in that sub-section. A court must not reduce the sentence so that it becomes unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and the circumstances of the offence: s 23(3). Accordingly, there is a limit to the value that may be accorded for the applicant's assistance to authorities in this case. Care is required to be taken to ensure that the ultimate sentencing result is not one that is so far out of touch with the circumstances of the particular offence and the particular offender: R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 232 per Gleeson CJ. The appropriateness of any discount for assistance involves an assessment of other features of a case where the ultimate consideration is whether the resultant sentence is a just one: R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 at [53]; R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195 at [26]. 

62In my assessment, a combined assessment of 50% could not be justified. The assistance given by the applicant does not, in my opinion, qualify as exceptional.

63I am accordingly of the opinion that:

(i) The aggregate sentence imposed was an appropriate sentence upon the basis that the offence Count 1 was an offence involving mid-range objective seriousness.

(ii) A combined discount greater than that allowed and applied by the sentencing judge (42.5%) would be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offending for which the applicant was sentenced.

64I have accordingly concluded that no other less severe sentence is warranted in law.

65The orders I propose are:

(1) Leave to appeal be granted.

(2) The appeal be dismissed.

66R A HULME J: The learned sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence and indicated the sentences he would have set if he had sentenced for the offences individually. He did not indicate a notional starting point before discounts for the pleas of guilty and assistance in respect of the indicative individual sentences. He said in respect of the aggregate sentence that his starting point was ""at least fourteen years imprisonment"". Then, applying a combined discount of 42.5 percent, he imposed the aggregate sentence of 8 years.

67Assessment of the objective seriousness of the individual offences was of obvious importance. His Honour found that the commercial supply charge (count 1) was ""well above the middle of the range"" and that the two firearm offences, involving as they did the possession by a drug dealer of a revolver and a sawn-off shotgun, were assessed as being ""within the middle of the range of seriousness for such offending"". 

68For the disposition of this matter I am prepared to assume that the objective seriousness of the drug supply offence was in the middle of the range, rather than ""well above"" it. But when one has regard to the facts in relation to that charge as outlined in the judgment of Hall J; the need for a significant increment because of the need to take into account three further drug supply charges, one involving a commercial quantity; and the applicant's possession of two concealable and obviously very lethal firearms; it is apparent that a very stern sentencing imposition was called for.

69The ""at least fourteen years"" starting point adopted by the sentencing judge for the aggregate sentence cannot be criticised. The conceded error in relation to the reduction of sentence on account of the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty is counterbalanced by the excessively generous reduction for assistance which was valuable but not ""exceptional"".

70I agree with Hall J that, despite the conceded errors of the sentencing judge, no lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed. I also agree with the orders his Honour proposes.

71DAVIES J: I agree with Hall J and with the additional remarks of RA Hulme J.

		20 May 2014",2014-05-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763959,R v CM [2014] NSWSC 815,"Judgment
1HER HONOUR:  Before the Court is a release application by CM, a juvenile aged 14.  The offences with which CM stands charged fall into two categories.  There are six what I might call historical allegations preceding a period spent in custody by CM.  He was released to parole on 11 February 2014 and since then has been charged with seven further offences relating to three separate incidents.  He has been in custody since the date of the last of those allegations, 26 April 2014.  His matters are currently listed before Dubbo Children's Court on 16 June 2014 for mention only.
2The Court in determining the application must have regard to the matters identified in s 3 of the Bail Act 2013, namely, the presumption of innocence and a person's general right to be at liberty.  I consider that right to be of higher significance in the case of a child of the age of the present applicant.  
3The Court must consider whether there are any unacceptable risks of the kind identified in s 17 Bail Act.  The Crown identifies two risks, the risk of commission of a serious offence and risk to the safety of the victim or individuals or the community.  The primary material on which those risks can be assessed is the statement of facts in respect of the current charges.
4The offences alleged are of themselves relatively serious, involving in the first instance an allegation of entering inclosed lands.  That allegation involved a confrontation with a member of the public but there is no allegation of violence or indeed any apparent threat of violence.  The second series of allegations relating to 5 April 2014 resulted in charges of breaking and entering with intent to steal and destroying or damaging property.  The facts in respect of those charges reveal no confrontation with any member of the public, no violence and are indeed what might be described as property offences not of great seriousness but ones which nonetheless must be regarded as serious having regard to the maximum penalties for those kinds of offences.
5The third series of charges again would be described primarily as property offences, again involving no suggestion of violence or the use of any weapon, although in that case there was an elderly victim whose handbag was stolen and the incident, if the allegations are proved, would have been quite frightening for her.  The cases in respect of the first two series of charges are strong, there being DNA evidence against the applicant.
6I accept, as submitted by Ms Rigg on behalf of the applicant, that in considering the seriousness of the kinds of offences which it might be thought the applicant is at risk of committing it is appropriate to have regard to the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission, which reveal that it is only in a small percentage of like offences that a child like the applicant would receive a control order.
7On the strength of the allegations against the applicant and his prior criminal history I am satisfied that there is an unacceptable risk within the meaning of s 17 of the Bail Act of the commission of a serious offence and, allied with that, having regard to the charges involving entering premises where people are present, some risk, albeit a small one, to the safety of individuals and the community generally.  In reaching that conclusion I note that the Act contemplates that bail is not expected to be entirely risk-free.  The task for the Court is to undertake an evaluative assessment of the risks referred to in s 17.
8Having reached that conclusion, however, I am satisfied that the risks to which I have referred can be sufficiently mitigated by the imposition of the conditions proposed.  It follows that I must grant bail conditionally.
9The Crown sought a security requirement but it is not appropriate to impose such a requirement unless it is considered necessary to mitigate a risk of failure to appear.  I am not satisfied that there is any such risk in the present case.

1The events the subject of this appeal arise out of an affray and riot which took place at Sydney Domestic Airport on 22 March 2009 involving members of two rival motorcycle clubs, the Comanchero Motorcycle Club (CMC) and the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club (HA). In the course of what occurred a member of the HA, Anthony Zervas (the deceased), was killed.

2As a consequence, Mahmoud Hawi (the appellant) and five other members of the CMC, Christian Menzies, Ishmail Eken, Usama Potrus, Farres Abounader and Zoran Kisacanin were each charged with the murder of the deceased. They were also charged with participating in a riot.

3After a trial which took place between 24 May 2011 and 2 November 2011, the appellant was convicted of murder. All five co-accused were acquitted of the charge.

4Manslaughter was left to the jury. The jury was unable to agree on a verdict in relation to Messrs Menzies and Abounader but acquitted the remaining co-accused.

5The appellant and his co-accused were charged with riot in addition to murder. Ultimately, no verdict was sought against Messrs Hawi, Menzies or Abounader, whilst Messrs Eken, Potrus and Kisacanin were found guilty of this offence.

6The charges referred to above related to events which occurred in the departure hall of Terminal 3 at Sydney Domestic Airport (the departure hall). Prior to this event an altercation between members of both clubs had taken place outside Gate 5 of Terminal 3 (Gate 5). Messrs Hawi, Menzies, Eken and Kisacanin were also charged with affray arising out of that incident. Only Messrs Hawi, Menzies and Kisacanin were found guilty. A member of HA (David Padovan) was charged with riot (in the departure hall) and affray (in the departure hall and outside Gate 5), but found not guilty. 

7The appellant appealed against his conviction for murder. As one of the grounds of appeal was that the verdict was unreasonable, it is necessary to set out in detail the background facts and evidence as it emerged at the trial.

8It is convenient to deal first with evidence describing the various participants in the events of 22 March 2009, then the events which took place on a flight from Melbourne to Sydney (QF430), the events outside Gate 5 and finally, the riot which took place in the departure hall where the deceased was killed.

The persons involved

CMC members on trial with the appellant

9There were 12 members of the CMC involved in the incident. However, not all of them were tried with the appellant. The identity and description of the appellant and other five CMC members tried with him can be summarised as follows.

10The appellant was 28 years of age at the time of the incident. He was the National President of the CMC. Biometric details of the appellant contained in the jury bundle state that he was about 178 cm tall. Images from CCTV footage taken at the time of the incident and photographs taken by police on 6 April 2009 show the appellant as very muscular and having a large tattoo on his left shoulder that ended below his left ear.

The evidence

The flight to Sydney

32The aircraft which operated QF430 was a Boeing 767 with seven seats in each row in a configuration of two-three-two, marked A-K from left to right.

33Five members of the CMC were on the plane, including the appellant and Mr Menzies. The appellant and Mr Menzies were in seats 44D and 44F respectively. The other CMC members were in seats 35K, 43F and 44E.

34Mr Wainohu, the President of the HA, was also on the plane occupying seat 39K. Ms Rebecca Ketelhohn, a flight attendant, said after the plane had landed three of the men including the appellant, moved directly in front of her to get out of the plane. She said she saw the appellant call out a word to a passenger in the opposite aisle and make a gesture, pulling down his eyelid and then pointing to the person in question. She said the person in question repeated the action.

35Josephine Stevenson, a passenger sitting in seat 32K, gave evidence about a passenger who she described as about 5 feet 10 inches, thickset, of Middle Eastern appearance, aged between 20 and 30 years, wearing blue jeans and a white singlet. She said he was walking up and down the plane and the second time he did so, he pointed to a person behind her and said words in a different language. She said he was aggressive.

36Matthew McCrone, seated in seat 34J, described four men boarding the plane, one of whom he described as an alpha male. He said the alpha male and one man came down the aisle furthest from him, while the other two went down the aisle closest to him. He described the alpha male as wearing a white t-shirt and blue tracksuit pants. He said he was of Middle Eastern appearance, of solid build and had a tattoo around a bicep. He said that he was moving up and down the aisle. He said that at one stage when the man was in front of him, he stopped and pointed. He heard the words ""Before we land in Sydney you mother fucker"".

37Mr McCrone agreed the man in question seemed to be pointing and speaking to someone in seat 35K. He was not told that Mr Aouli was sitting in that seat. He agreed he would not be able to see persons in row 44 from where he was sitting as his view was blocked by a partition.

38It should be noted that the descriptions given by Ms Stevenson and Mr McCrone did not match the clothing of any of the persons said to be involved in the incidents.

39Rosemary Pagano was seated in seat 39J next to Mr Wainohu. She saw three men walking in the opposite aisle. She said one was wearing a white shirt and was tall and the other was wearing an olive t-shirt and about the same height. She subsequently saw the man in the white t-shirt staring at the man next to her with an angry expression. Mr Wainohu then started sending and receiving texts.

40Samantha Richards was seated in seat 33K. She saw two men of Middle Eastern appearance. She described one as very ""muscly"", having a shaved head and wearing a tight black singlet or shirt. She subsequently saw another man stopping diagonally from her and speaking in Arabic to someone behind her. She said he was angry. She described him as being in his late 40s, shorter than the other two men and of slim build. She agreed that she had given a different description to the police.

41Judith Auton was seated in seat 35J next to Mr Aouli. She said he made a phone call in a foreign language but she heard ""Qantas domestic"". She also heard him make another phone call in which he said that ""the plane arrives at 1.30"".

42Jonothan Patterson was seated in seat 40J. He saw a thickset man of Maori descent in front of him. Subsequently he saw three men whom he described as large and thickset of Maori appearance. He noticed that one of the men was wearing a CMC t-shirt.

43Andrea Halbert noticed four men of Middle Eastern appearance wearing casual clothes when she was checking-in for flight QF430. She was seated in seat 38B. She saw four men get onto the plane and saw at least two of them talk to another man. There was pointing and they did not appear friendly.

44Trudi McEntee was seated in seat 44A. She observed the passengers in seats 44D, 44E and 44F. She described the man in 44D as very big and dark-skinned, wearing a white tank top with a distinctive tattoo down his left arm. She also said he was wearing pale tracksuit pants with a stripe down the side.

45Ms McEntee described the man in seat 44E as well-built, stocky, muscular, with neat hair and a thin moustache and wearing a black polo shirt with yellow stitching and an emblem. 

46Ms McEntee observed the men were in a hurry when they left the aircraft. She heard one of them say ""It's time, time man"".

47Matthew Jones was seated in seat 43F. He described four men of Middle Eastern descent, one dressed in a white tracksuit. One of the men, who was of Middle Eastern appearance and wearing a long-sleeved black top, sat next to him. He gave evidence that the man in white said ""Get the guys to meet us at the other end"".

48Nathan Anderson was seated in seat 45D. He said the persons in the row in front of him were of slightly above average height and of Middle Eastern appearance. The man in seat 44E (Mr Eken) was wearing a black CMC t-shirt. The man in seat 45F (Mr Menzies) had a ""spider web's tattoo"" on his elbow. When the plane landed the three men in front of him got up quickly and moved off the plane faster than any other passengers.

49Lucinda Milton was seated in seat 40D. She noted between two and four men of Middle Eastern appearance. In her police statement she said they all had short dark brown or black hair and were wearing t-shirts, one was black and one was white. She said the person in the white t-shirt may have been wearing light coloured pants or three-quarter length shorts. At one stage she saw the man in white staring at a person near her boyfriend. 

50Ian Schilling was seated in seat 43D next to Mr Pirini. After the plane landed he saw him talking to a number of other men. One of the men had a mobile phone and was referring a message on the phone to the others on the plane. 

The affray at Gate 5 

51A number of passengers gave evidence of the events which occurred outside Gate 5.

52Ms Pagano, to whose evidence I have already referred, gave evidence that when she got off the plane she heard yelling and scuffles. She saw that the man who was sitting next to her on the plane (Mr Wainohu) was part of a group of men who were ""overseeing him"". She estimated there were 30 men. She saw kicking, punching and there was yelling and screaming. She noticed the fight was moving towards her and she went into the Guess shop. She saw the man who was sitting next to her walk away with two men, one of whom had no shirt and was wearing shorts.

53Ms Halbert said that after she disembarked the plane she went into the Watermark Bookshop. She said that whilst she was in the bookshop she heard a lot of commotion and screaming. She saw a man who appeared to be being chased by some people. She then saw other people running in the opposite direction.

54Ms McEntee said that as she came out of the aerobridge she saw men fighting and wrestling. She saw the men from seats 44D, 44E, 43D and 43E. The man from seat 44D (the appellant) was holding a man she had not seen before. She said he was holding him and trying to hit him. The man from seat 44D punched the man on the side of his face whilst holding him. She said the men she saw seated in seats 43D and 43E were trying to get to the man being held down and keep the other men off the man from seat 44D. The man from seat 44D and the other men were holding the man on the ground and one of them kicked him aggressively in the kidney area. The man on the ground slipped out of his t-shirt and got away from the men who were chasing him.

55As Mr Jones emerged into the Gate 5 area he saw a man in white approach two men near a ""booth"". He saw some men coming down the alleyway from the right of the gate and a fight broke out. He saw a man with his shirt off on the ground and a further person was kicking him in his chest. He saw the man in white walking to the exit with ""maybe three"" other men.

56Andrew Dudgeon was one of the first off the aerobridge. He saw a number of men by a buggy. When the three men he observed on the plane disembarked, he saw a fight break out. He said that he saw a man who was sitting on the buggy attacked from his left and punched in the head quite violently. He went down on one knee and was kicked in the head by the person who punched him. He said the man who punched him on the ground was not one of the three men on the plane that he had observed earlier.

57Mr Anderson arrived off the aerobridge and saw a group of 15 to 25 men. He saw two men on the ground that were being punched and kicked. He said the main group excluding the two on the ground walked off. The other two then got up and walked in the same direction but at a slower speed. 

58Shen Li Chong worked at a store next to Gate 5. She heard yelling. She saw one man looking angry and punching another man. After the man who was punched fell to the ground, the angry man and two other men ran off. The man on the ground got up, took his bag and walked forward.

59Dimitra Kriticos was a security officer in Terminal 3. Between 1.20 and 1.40 pm approximately ten men approached the screening area for screening. They asked where Gate 5 was and went through the screening. Two of the men remained behind and did not go through the screening. After five or ten minutes the men came back through the bi-fold doors, running. She could not say how many men she saw. Some time later, whilst working, she saw three or four men getting into a cab. She took down the number plate ""T412"". Prior to that she had heard screaming at the other side of the terminal.

60Ms Kriticos conceded in cross-examination, after watching CCTV footage, that the group she saw were walking not running. 

61Alfred Dokli was at Gate 5 when he saw a group of about ten men and a group of about three men fighting each other. He saw a punch and the two groups started running in the same direction that he was going.

62Eyiram Dokli was at a store near Gate 5. She saw a group of three men and a group of ten men yelling at each other. She heard, ""Not in here. Let's take it outside"". 

63Eyiram Dokli described a man with a bumbag, t-shirt and baseball cap in the group of ten men. She said most of the group of ten were Middle Eastern but one was an Islander. One of the men of Middle Eastern appearance was wearing a white singlet and white tracksuit.

64Eyiram Dokli saw a fight break out and moved away.

65Eyiram Dokli looked back and saw a person on the ground being kicked by the group of ten men. After that she saw that the group of ten men and the group of three men were ""back together"". She heard the man in the white shirt and tracksuit say, ""Next time we see you, you're going to have bullets through you. You're a dead man walking"". She said that when he said this he was pointing to three men who were standing on their own.

66Eyiram Dokli agreed she told the police that she was pretty sure the man who said, ""Not in here take it outside"" was one of the group of ten. 

67Edem Dokli saw two men of Anglo Saxon appearance and one of Middle Eastern appearance. She heard yelling, ""Not in here, not in here. Let's take this outside"". She then saw a group of five or six men of Middle Eastern appearance. One stood out. He was tall, wearing a white tank top that said ""Everlast"" and shorts. She saw the man in the ""Everlast"" shirt push over one of the men in the group of three. That man was wearing a red t-shirt.

68Jeanne Dunn saw fighting whilst she was in the Guess shop. She saw two men punching each other and the shorter man took his t-shirt off.

69Jeffrey Searle was helping passengers who required the use of a wheelchair. He was standing at Gate 5. He saw a group of men coming off the flight, followed by another two or three.

70Mr Searle saw one man punch another man in the face. The man fell to the ground. A fight broke out.

71Mr Searle agreed that in a statement to the police he described a male wearing a white t-shirt with black writing across it and with blue denim jeans, and another male wearing a dark t-shirt with a jacket or jumper and blue denim jeans. He saw the man in the white t-shirt punch the other and hit him in the head. He confirmed in cross-examination that another man he had described as wearing a black t-shirt and white pants was not the one who threw the punch.

72Margaret McKay was outside the Watermark Bookshop. She saw a young man being hit. He was about 28 to 32 years of age, of Middle Eastern appearance, 5 feet 9 inches tall and wearing light brown pants, white sneakers and the remains of a white or cream shirt.

73The other two men in the fight were of the same age and background. Ms McKay described a ferocious fight in which there were powerful punches and kicks. Other men gathered around after the fight. The young man on the ground walked off with two other men in the direction of Gate 4. The two other men who had been in the fight walked off with a group of five to eight men.

74Karen Ford was near Gate 5. She heard screaming and saw a group of men brawling. A man on the ground was being punched and kicked. She said he was ""an Islander"". He did not have a shirt on.

80In the second group there was a very tall man of Middle Eastern appearance, wearing a blue or grey dark coloured jumper with a collar and tracksuit pants that were a lighter blue or grey. Ms Osborn saw that man point to the other group and say, ""You're a dead man, you're fucking dead, you've got bullet holes in you"".

81Louis Youssef saw ten men fighting, punching, kicking and swearing in English and Arabic. Someone said, ""Not here, let's not do it here"" and ""Just wait till we head outside"". He agreed he told police he had heard men yelling words like ""Fuck you, we're going to get you, you're a fucking dog"".

82Troy Hazelden saw two men walk past him. They were both in their late 20s or 30s and athletic. One was about 5 feet 11 inches tall and wearing a blue singlet.

The man fell to the ground and got up again.

83Ian Richardson was seated in seat 31J. After he disembarked he saw a dark-skinned man in the foetal position whilst three or four men kicked him. He described a man in a black t-shirt with a yellow and orange motif trying to break-up the incident and help the man up. This description matched that of Mr Wainohu.

84Rhonda Richardson heard someone call the man on the ground without a shirt (who it was common ground was Mr Padovan) a ""monkey"".

85Kerry Hankinson was waiting for a flight at Gate 5 when she saw six or seven men arguing loudly. One was stockier and appeared older. The Crown submitted this was Mr Wainohu. She saw this man walking back towards the others saying, ""Yeah I got something for you in my bag"". She heard hitting sounds or the sounds of someone falling. She looked back and saw the man, that it was submitted was Mr Wainohu, on the ground. Another man with long stringy hair was also on the ground and further back a younger man without a shirt was curled into a ball while another younger man was kicking him.

86Clifford Kroeger said he saw a group of approximately six well-built young men punching and kicking another person. 

87Mr Kroeger said one man who appeared to be the leader of the group was muscular and wearing white pants and a white shirt. The one who was the leader pointed to the man on the ground and said, ""You're dead, you're fucking dead"". 

88Mr Kroeger identified the appellant as the leader of the group from a photograph.

89Rodney Moore heard swearing over his left shoulder and heard someone say, ""I've fucking got something for you"". The man had a carry on bag and he and another man walked to a cart and as soon as he turned around two men hit him and he ""went straight to the ground"". The man who was with him was then ""king hit"".

90Rebecca Porter was in the Watermark Bookshop. She saw a man, who was agreed to be Mr Padovan, with seven or ten men behind him, hitting him. After a second altercation the men appeared to let Mr Padovan go. He then met up with an older man.

92There were several other witnesses to the affray at Gate 5 (Roger Auton, Alicia Deak, Lisa Purton, Katarina Garas, Christian Avramides, Joanna Caldwell, Anne Copley Smith, Perez Sioneholo and Owen O'Shea). However their evidence does not add anything significant to the evidence described above.

The riot and fatal assault

93CCTV footage recorded in part the movement of the participants from the vicinity surrounding Gate 5 to the departure hall. CCTV footage shows ten CMC members followed by three HA members walking towards the bi-fold exit doors. The CMC members, including the appellant, are seen looking over their shoulders. The footage was timed at approximately 1.38 pm-1:40 pm.

94CCTV footage taken from inside the secure area shows the appellant and the other CMC members looking back. It shows the three HA members walking through the bi-fold doors and into the departure hall.

95The CCTV footage shows the appellant and others exiting the bi-fold doors and walking east behind the economy class check-in counters. Further footage shows the CMC members meeting up with Mr Abounader and Mr Potrus and the group of 12 walking towards the check-in counters in the departure hall in the direction where the HA members are. They are seen as initially walking before speeding up to move quickly.

96The CCTV footage then shows the deceased moving behind the counter in a westerly direction towards the CMC members followed by the other HA members. The deceased puts his hood up as he moves. At the same time the CMC members can be seen behind the check-in counters moving in an easterly direction towards where the HA members are.

97The deceased and Mr Baker are seen to move around behind the CMC members. The appellant and other indistinguishable figures can also be seen moving at this time. 

98The CCTV footage shows that having walked behind the appellant's group, the deceased is seen rushing back towards them. The footage also shows Peter Zervas running towards the CMC group. It also shows the appellant retreating twice before the deceased is seen to run in to attack him.

99More than 50 witnesses gave evidence in relation to the events that occurred in the departure hall on 22 March 2009. In addition, the two police informers, referred to as AL and SP, also gave evidence in relation to the incident. 

100In summary, several witnesses gave evidence of a person using a bollard whose description was in some respects consistent with that person being the appellant. Xanthe Gray described the man as wearing light coloured pants. However in her first statement to police she described the man as wearing dark coloured clothing and thought he was wearing shorts. George Teale described one of the men using balustrades as wearing ""whitish pants"". However, he also stated that the man was without a shirt. Karen-Ann Whyte identified a photograph of the appellant as the person who ""Bashed a man to death with an instrument"". However, in cross-examination she accepted she had described the man to the police as ""slightly overweight with a pot belly"", wearing a shirt, not a t-shirt, and that the shirt was possibly blue or pale blue in colour. John Ireland described the man as wearing white trousers and a white shirt. He also described that man as using a putting motion with the bollard. However this description and Mr Ireland's chronological recount of events did not fit with the evidence of any other witness. Marie Ireland also saw a man dressed all in white. He was leaning over the man on the ground but she could not see what he was doing. The informer SP stated that Mr Menzies hit the deceased with a bollard once or twice and the appellant struck the deceased once, although in either case he did not see the bollard connect with the deceased. However, as set out below, his evidence was the subject of extensive criticism in cross-examination.

101There were, however, witnesses whose description of the man using the bollard was directly inconsistent with that person being the appellant. For instance, Leanne Buckingham described the person hitting the deceased with the bollard as wearing a khaki singlet. Keith Teale described the man using the bollard as short, stocky, with broad shoulders and wearing a dark pair of shorts with perhaps a white shirt. In particular, Keith Teale stated that the man using the bollard was not the man wearing white trousers. Robert Barnes described two men assaulting the man on the ground. The men appeared to be of Middle Eastern appearance and one may have been wearing a black tracksuit possibly with a white stripe on the trousers. He also referred to a man, in a white singlet with a motif on the front, yelling with another man. He stated that he did not see the man in the white top involved in the incident with the man on the ground. Judith Hanes stated that she saw three men, at least two of whom had bollards. She described one of those men as wearing a t-shirt or singlet that was either darkish blue or green. Mark Prunty stated that there were four men around a man on the ground. One of the four men was wearing a black or dark coloured singlet and grey tracksuit pants. He could not clearly describe the other three men. Bronwyn Brown described the man using the bollard as wearing black pants with a light coloured t-shirt that she thought was yellow. Steven Huggard described the man using the bollard as large, bulky and wearing very dark clothing. He also described a second man using a bollard whose clothing was also ""dark and dirty"". The informer AL gave evidence that Mr Menzies hit the deceased with a silver instrument that he thought was a rubbish bin. However, his evidence was also the subject of extensive criticism in cross-examination.

102A summary of the evidence of each of the witnesses concerning the events in the departure hall is set out below. For convenience, the evidence is divided into the following broad groupings:

(1)witnesses who described in detail the events and provided some description of the persons involved in the incident with the deceased;
(2)the evidence of the informers AL and SP; and
(3)witnesses who provided a general description of the events but were unable to describe those involved in the incident with the deceased. 

(1) Witnesses who described the events in detail

103Ms Buckingham was a flight attendant with Qantas at the time and was arriving at Terminal 3 to begin work when the incident took place. Ms Buckingham gave evidence that she saw three men around another (the deceased). The deceased was lying in what she described as the recovery position. Two of the men were standing behind him and one man in front of him. The two men were kicking him in his back and the third was kicking him in the front. Ms Buckingham was unable to describe any of these three men.

104Ms Buckingham stated that there was another man standing at the head of the deceased. She described this man as wearing a khaki singlet who she had previously seen enter Terminal 3. Earlier in her evidence she stated that this man might have been of Maori or Islander ancestry, about 6 feet or 6 feet 2 inches tall and in his mid to late 20s. She stated that she saw this man pick up a bollard with both hands, raise it and hit the man on the ground with it. She stated that she saw him bring the bollard down only once before he threw it a short distance. She stated that it was the bottom or stand end of the bollard that came closest to the victim. Ms Buckingham then rendered assistance to the victim.

105In cross-examination Ms Buckingham confirmed that the man with the bollard that she identified was wearing a singlet that exposed his shoulders and not a t-shirt. She also stated that the man had short-cropped hair, not shaved. She also confirmed in cross-examination that she had been unable to identify any person during two line-up identification parades. 

106Ms Gray was in the departure hall to catch a flight and was at an internet check-in kiosk at the time of the incident. She gave evidence that she witnessed altercations in three groups. She stated that in one altercation she saw two men fighting. One was being punched and kicked; he fell to the floor and appeared to be defending himself with his arms and legs. He was kicked in the abdominal area. Then the other man ""grabbed a nearby barrier pole and stamped it over his head"". She described this man as ""wearing light coloured pants"", in his late 20s or early 30s with olive skin and probably of Mediterranean descent. She stated that the man placed the pole on the ground and it rolled a metre or two away. She described the force used by the man as ""excessive"". In cross-examination she stated that she was 10 to 12 metres from the man with the bollard.

107Ms Gray gave evidence that at a later date she was shown several packets of photographs. From those packets she selected photographs of the appellant and Peter Zervas. She stated in relation to the picture of the appellant that it ""looked very familiar to someone that I had seen that day at the airport"", but that she was unable to say what the man was doing at the airport.

108Ms Gray accepted in cross-examination that in her first statement to police she described the assailant as ""not Caucasian, possibly Lebanese or Mediterranean appearance, late 20s early 30s in age, he had an average build, approximately 175 cm tall with black or brown hair, he was wearing dark coloured clothing, I think he was wearing shorts"". In selecting the photograph of the appellant Ms Gray also accepted that she had said ""I don't know why but this guy looks familiar"".

109Mr Barnes was a pilot who was in the departure hall waiting to catch a flight to Adelaide. At the time of the incident he was standing at one of the automatic check-in kiosks but moved backwards a couple of metres as the incident continued. He gave evidence of a general brawl that was comprised of a number of small brawls. He saw metal bollards being picked up and thrown in the air. He saw someone on the ground block a bollard with his arm as it came down on to him. He then saw that particular man get up and continue fighting. 

110Mr Barnes also noticed a brawl near the glass wall where the entrance doors were located. There was a male on the ground that was being kicked and stomped. After several kicks and stomps on his body and head he appeared motionless. There were two or three men assaulting the man on the ground. They appeared to be of Middle Eastern ethnicity and one of them may have been wearing a black tracksuit possibly with a white stripe on the trousers. He gave evidence that he saw a man pick up a metal bollard, raise it over his head and smash it on to the man on the ground on his chest. He saw the bollard come up a second time and this time it came down on to his head. He confirmed that the base of the bollard was pointing towards the ground. 

111Mr Barnes described two men standing to the eastern side of the brawl. One was wearing a green singlet. He had a shaved head, was of Middle Eastern appearance and was around five feet nine or ten inches. The other had very short brown hair, a rectangular goatee, was over six feet tall, with broad shoulders and was wearing a white singlet with a motif on the front. He could not recall specifically if the man in the white singlet did anything. 

112Mr Barnes conceded in cross-examination that notes he had made shortly following the incident made no mention of a man wearing a white top. He confirmed in cross-examination that he did not see the man in the white top pick up a bollard and use it as a weapon. He accepted that at the committal hearing he gave evidence that the person using the bollard was ""shorter than the man in the white T-shirt, not shorter than the man - not necessarily shorter than the man in the green T-shirt"". He confirmed that he had been unable to identify any persons in two line-up parades. 

113Julie Roelandts was employed by Qantas and at the relevant time was working as a customer service agent on counter 16. She generally described the brawl. In relation to the use of the bollard she stated that a man picked it up and was shaking it trying to get it off its strapping. He lifted it over the top of his right shoulder and went to smash it down in front of him. She closed her eyes and did not see it connect. She described him as being a smaller build than the first person she saw and had a lighter coloured t-shirt on. The first person that she referred to was described as ""a big person"" who appeared to be of Maori ethnicity, about six feet tall, tattooed on the front of his neck and down his arms and wearing a bright shirt.

114Trevor Brennan was in the departure hall on the day of the incident and was queuing to check-in. As a result of the proximity of the fight Mr Brennan grabbed Marie Weibrecht who was standing in front of him and they fell sideways over luggage. He looked up and saw a man unhooking one of the bollards. The man stood with the bollard over his head before walking towards the window, to the south. Mr Brennan described the man as thick set and of Islander origin, either Samoan or Maori. In cross-examination he agreed that the man was about 180-182 cm tall. He did not see the man swing the bollard. He also agreed in cross-examination that he had told police that he would recognise the man who picked up the bollard, but that he had not been asked to attend a line-up parade or to look at photographs.

115Elizabeth Rapkins was employed by Qantas and at the relevant time was working at counter 14 in the departure hall. She stated that between 10 and 14 men were arguing and then ran between the counters. She described them generally as between ""16 and 30, European, Middle Eastern"". She described one man in particular as bigger than the others with very short hair, wearing a green singlet top and with a tattoo on his left arm. She also described a man wearing a silver grey hooded jacket. She saw the man wearing the green singlet pick up a silver bollard. He picked up a bollard near the front doors but she did not see what he did with it.

116Kirsty Cutajar was in the departure hall to catch a flight with her husband and two daughters. She was sitting with her family on a bench seat that was located near a doorway. About six men who she described as having short dark hair, of Middle Eastern appearance and wearing tracksuit type clothing, walked past her. About 5 or 10 minutes later shouting commenced behind counters 10, 11 and 12. She stated that the men began to fight and also began to pick up metal bollards and hit each other. 

117Ms Cutajar described two incidents that occurred in front of her. She saw a man on the ground holding his hands up towards his face as men were kicking him. There were about three men kicking him. She also noticed two men break off to the right hand side. She described one of the men as a taller Arabic looking man with a goatee, whilst she said the other was wearing a ""greeny"" coloured shirt that was ripped and was also wearing lighter faded jeans and joggers. She said the latter man also had shaved short hair. 

118In relation to the man being kicked on the ground, Ms Cutajar stated that she also saw bollards being used. She could not say how many men were using bollards. Due to the fight on her right, Ms Cutajar moved backwards in her seat and her view of the man on the ground was obscured by an automatic teller machine (ATM). Three men then passed in front of her from the area where the man was lying on the ground. One man was without shoes and another wiped blood from his upper body. The latter man looked physically strong, medium build, medium height, with a goatee and well groomed. She could not describe the other two men further. The man with the ripped shirt then stumbled backwards to the injured person on the ground. 

119In cross-examination Ms Cutajar accepted that she had said there were two males ""really laying into one male on the ground"". However, upon reflection she felt it was more than two. She said the men kicking the man on the ground were of Middle Eastern appearance and wearing tracksuits. She could not describe the colour. She did not see the man on the ground being hit with the bollard after her vision was obscured by the ATM.

120Keith Teale and his wife took his brother to catch a flight. At the time of the incident they were at one of the check-in kiosks in the departure hall. Keith Teale described one man being chased by another, shortly followed by a third. The first man fell to the ground and he said it was possible the second man also fell. The third man came through, picked up a bollard and hit the first man who had fallen to the ground. The man who had been knocked down was a very slight person. The man who was using the bollard was short and stocky with big broad shoulders. Keith Teale estimated his height as five feet eight inches and stated that he was wearing a dark pair of shorts. He could not be sure about his shirt, but it was perhaps white. He was possibly Middle Eastern. Keith Teale described the action of the bollard as a downward motion with the base at the bottom. He stated that he saw the man being struck with the bollard possibly two or three times.

121Toward the end of the altercation Keith Teale was standing near one of the exit doors. A man came through the door and said to another ""You've got it coming, I'll get you tomorrow"". Keith Teale described the man who had spoken as ""probably 6 foot plus"" and wearing white trousers. Significantly, in cross-examination Mr Teale stated that the man using the bollard was not wearing white trousers. He accepted they were two different people. He was close enough to touch the man in white trousers. He also accepted in cross-examination that he was never asked to participate in a line-up parade or to review photographs.

122George Teale had travelled to the Sydney Domestic Airport with his brother Keith Teale and his brother's wife Heather. He said that about five feet or six feet away two men had what he described as ""balustrades"" and were hitting another man who they had knocked to the ground. He described one of the men as probably over six feet tall, around 80 kg, olive skinned, very short hair, with no chest hair, wearing whitish pants and without a shirt. He described his build as athletic. He could not describe the second man apart from the fact that he was smaller. 

123In cross-examination George Teale accepted that his police statement referred to one of the men wearing ""light coloured long pants"". He also accepted that his police statement only referred to one man with a bollard. He accepted that he had said in his statement that he was fairly confident he could remember the man swinging the bollard. He was unable to identify any person when shown photographs by police. He stated that as far as he was concerned he had not been shown a photograph of the man using the bollard. He accepted that Keith and Heather Teale were within a few metres of him at the relevant time. 

124Ms Hanes was in the departure hall. She had obtained her boarding pass from one of the kiosks and at the relevant time was queuing to check-in her luggage. She saw three men, two large and one smaller, who were fighting. They crashed to the floor about three metres away from her. They got up and started to pick up the bollards and throw them. Then they moved towards the window and her view was partially obscured. She saw the smaller man fall to the ground. She was unable to describe any of the men apart from one whose shirt was torn. In cross-examination she said that she could not say for sure whether all three men had bollards, but at least two did. She said in cross-examination that the torn shirt was hanging in strips from the man's front and had a big split up the side and was either darkish blue or green. She accepted it was possible that it was a singlet. She also accepted in cross-examination that the man with the darkish blue or green shirt had a bollard. 

125Helen Bagot met a friend, Jeff Bishop, at Terminal 3 and proceeded to queue to check-in her luggage in the departure hall. She saw a group of men, about a dozen. She saw none of their faces but she did see a man wearing a green t-shirt. She saw one man pick up a bollard between the baggage check-in and the ticket console. He swung it around virtually above his head. She did not see it connect with another person. She saw the leg of a person but could not see the rest of that person because a boarding pass ticket machine was blocking her view. There appeared to be someone kneeling on the ground beside the person. 

126Ms Bagot accepted in cross-examination that CCTV footage did not show fighting between counters eight and nine as she had described. She stated in cross-examination that the man in the green shirt was the man who had picked up the bollard and swung it around his head. She remembered seeing at least another two men swinging bollards around. She described the man in the green shirt as having short to medium dark hair. 

127Shalagh McCarthy was at the departure hall to catch a flight and at the relevant time had reached the head of the queue at the economy check-in counters. She saw two men running, followed ""within a beat"" by another man and then a cluster of perhaps five. 

128Ms McCarthy stated that two men separated from the cluster and ran further towards the glass doors and started to pick up bollards. The two men they seemed to be chasing moved away towards the doors and one of them fell to the ground. The man who fell seemed to be in a ""defensive or foetal position"". One man stood next to the chest or head of the man on the ground. He had a bollard in his hands and brought it down heavily. The other person stood near the man's head and ""didn't seem to prevent or interfere with what the man with the bollard was doing"". The man with the bollard raised his hands to about forehead height and brought the bollard straight down with some vigour. She saw him bring the bollard down twice and then she brought her hands up and shielded her eyes. 

129Ms McCarthy described the man with the bollard as ""not as chunky or compact as the others"", he seemed taller, ""a good figure of a man, not overweight nor slim ... but just a well proportioned man"". In cross-examination Ms McCarthy said the man with the bollard was possibly the largest in the group with fair coloured short hair, not shaved, that was not black. His face was not chiselled or thin. She confirmed that she had been unable to positively identify any persons when looking at photographs.

130Shayne O'Dwyer was a rescue medic who was in the business and Qantas Club check-in area. He saw a brawl involving 12 to 15 persons that was about 15 to 20 metres away. He saw a bollard being thrown across an area. He also saw a man lift up one of the bollards and hit a small man with it; the man holding the bollard had his back toward Mr O'Dwyer. He described the man as ""about 6 foot, short hair, tattoos, T-shirt, track pants maybe, runners"". He was bigger than the man who was hit, who was a ""young, skinny little guy"". The man with the bollard was also of dark skinned complexion. Later in cross-examination he accepted the description that he had given to police, including that the man with the bollard was of Middle Eastern appearance, dark short hair, coloured tattoos around both biceps, a ripped t-shirt, tracksuit or jogging pants and runners.

131Mr Prunty had arrived at Terminal 3 in a taxi and was walking towards a set of glass sliding doors leading to the departure hall when he noticed a fight taking place inside. He stated that there was a group of men inside the terminal standing over another man, punching and kicking him. The man was on the floor and there were four men around him. The first was about six feet four inches, quite muscular, of Lebanese appearance, with dark hair that was short on top and a bit longer at the back and wearing a black singlet and grey tracksuit pants. He also had tattoos on his arm. He was holding a steel bollard and hitting the man on the floor all over his body. There was a second male who was also hitting the man in much the same way. He was shorter, about six feet tall and of Lebanese appearance. In cross-examination Mr Prunty accepted that his statement to police stated that the first man was wearing a dark coloured singlet, not a black singlet.

132Mr Prunty could not see the second man as clearly because of the angle he was at. He described the other two men as Lebanese in appearance. They were punching and kicking the man and holding the man on the floor. He was defending himself but then he ""just sort of went limp"". The first man then yelled and all four men walked away from the man towards the centre of Terminal 3 where they met up with another four men. They then exited the building. In cross-examination Mr Prunty said that the man on the ground was pushed up against a bench and was hit with the bollards ten or more times. In cross-examination he said that he was more than five metres from the man on the ground. Mr Prunty accepted in cross-examination that he had reviewed photographs and had been unable to identify any person.

133Zhenya Welyczko was at a check-in kiosk when she heard some male voices yelling. During the fight she was facing an elderly couple sitting on a bench. She saw a man on the ground and then another man pick up a bollard and start hitting him on the head. She saw him raise the pole at least four times. She could not give a specific description of the man holding the bollard but stated that he was of a dark complexion, dark hair, solidly built and in his 30s. Ms Welyczko would have been between 20 and 30 metres away. In cross-examination Ms Welyczko accepted that she was asked to look at photographs and recognised one face that she understood was the brother of the victim. 

134Abigail Teh was standing at one of the electronic check-in kiosks with a colleague at the relevant time. She saw around four to five men fighting. They then split into two groups. In one group, two men were attacking one other man about five metres from her. The man was being punched and he fell down to the ground and one man grabbed a metal pole and hit him on the head. She only saw one man hit him with a metal pole. There was only one other man assaulting him. He was kicking the man on the ground. She described the two men as quite tall, muscular and fair, with short hair and wearing a ""casual normal T-shirt"". In cross-examination she said when the man was being hit with the bollard she was about seven to ten metres away. In cross-examination Ms Teh accepted she was unable to identify any person in photographs. She could not say how many men were involved in the fight in the second group as it was behind her. 

135Ms Brown was at the departure hall to catch a flight and was standing at an e-ticket machine at the relevant time. She saw one of the men pick up a silver bollard from the ground and lift it above his head in an action as if he was cutting wood with an axe. She saw him smash the bollard to the ground three times. She described him as six feet five inches, black hair shaved at the back, with olive skin, a tattoo on his right arm from shoulder to elbow and wearing black pants with a light coloured t-shirt which she thought was sleeveless. She also thought that the t-shirt was light yellow.

136Amanda Abbas was at the departure hall to catch a flight and was standing at one of the kiosks. She saw a group of men comprised of one Caucasian who it appeared was being chased by two men. The Caucasian man was quite small and had fair hair. She was unable to describe either of the two men chasing him. One of the men chasing him was holding a metal bollard and she saw him swing it at the smaller man. The first swing did not make contact. The action that was used was like swinging an axe.

137Ms Abbas described a separate incident that was occurring closer to her that also involved three men. The first appeared chubby with curly black hair wearing a white shirt, the second was Mediterranean in appearance and the third was Islander, quite muscular, with tattoos and with a ridge of hair at the top of his head. In cross-examination she stated that the man in the white t-shirt was being punched by the other two in the stomach region.

138Alice Riva was a Qantas employee who on the day in question had flown from Brisbane to Sydney. At the relevant time she was speaking to a former colleague at the sales desk. She saw one man on the ground with about four or five men holding Tensa poles and hitting him continuously. They were raising their arms and bringing the pole down onto the man on the ground. All of them had poles. She was unable to describe them as they were too far away. She said they were big guys and thought that one was wearing a tracksuit. She walked outside to speak to the triple-0 operator and saw three men, the first who she described as tall, dark hair, blue eyes. The one next to him was a little shorter with dark hair. She thought they were Caucasian. She could not describe the third man. In cross-examination she acknowledged that she had told police that the men hitting the man on the ground all had dark hair. Her statement also said that all the men were wearing long pants.

139Mr Huggard was in the departure hall to catch a flight and at the relevant time had just proceeded through the scanning area. Mr Huggard's vision was toward the front of the airport. He saw a man running and described him as a ""surfy"" type person, suntanned or darker, aged in his mid 30s and of Anglo Saxon descent. He saw a man with his arms outstretched bringing his arms to chin height and then bringing them down in front of him. He described the action as if ""you were putting a spike into the ground with a spike impaler, just hard vigorous motion"". He said that he saw this motion twice and part of the third motion at which time his vision was obscured. He described the man as large, very bulky, very dark, somewhere around six feet tall and wearing very dark clothing. He appeared to be wearing a t-shirt. He described the man's face as a ""dark dirty face"" and his hair was ""tight"". In cross-examination Mr Huggard stated that the man appeared to have a fat stomach and seemed to have facial hair.

140Mr Huggard explained that to the left of the man was a smaller person who was doing a similar action but on a different angle. He described the man as of smaller stature, once again in dark clothing and with tight hair. The action of this person was much quicker than the action of the other man. Mr Huggard stated the latter man made 3 or more strikes at what appeared to be a 45 degree angle. In cross-examination Mr Huggard stated that the second man appeared to be five feet seven inches tall, but that he was stooped. He accepted in cross-examination that he had been unable to identify anyone in photographs shown to him by police, that he had had a split second view, and that he was about 50 metres away.

141Roger Whyte was with his wife walking from Terminal 2 to 3. At the relevant time they were directly adjacent to where passengers were queuing for the economy check-in counters. Mr Whyte observed 10 or 12 persons involved in a fight. His attention was drawn to two persons, one was five feet nine or ten inches, of Middle Eastern appearance, of stocky build, with tattoos on his arms and wearing a green singlet. He was fighting with a man who was an inch or two taller wearing a red t-shirt and black shorts. The second man was also stocky, of Middle Eastern appearance and had black curly hair. 

142Mr Whyte also saw a smaller man, around 5 feet 9 or 10 inches, with dark hair, of slight build, perhaps 70 kg, wearing a dark shirt and perhaps dark trousers and probably not much more than 30 years of age. He was being attacked by at least two people and perhaps up to four. He had a clear recollection of one of the assailants hitting the man with a silver bollard using a ""stamping"" action ""straight downwards"". He could not say how many times he did so but it would have been at least five times. He was unable to describe either man. He stated that he saw the two assailants run out of the door with two other men. They ran down the ramp and a short time later they ran back up the ramp. Mr Whyte accepted that he participated in seven different identification procedures but that he did not select any photographs. 

143Ms Whyte was travelling with her husband and they were making their way from Terminal 2 to 3. She described several groups fighting. She stated that there were four people fighting in a group; one of them broke free and ran off through the exit leaving two people bashing one person. She described the man who ran off as short and nuggetty with a sleeveless shirt. The man who was being bashed was slight in build, had tattoos on his right calf and was wearing a t-shirt, shorts, socks and joggers. He was the size of a jockey or a bit taller and of light build, perhaps 60 kg. They were fighting near an elderly couple who were about ten metres away. 

144Ms Whyte stated that at first the slight man tripped over. The two other men were punching him and the bigger man picked up a bollard and started hitting him with it. She described this man as clean cut, with dark hair, six feet tall, wearing a long-sleeved shirt and trousers and slightly overweight with a pot belly. The shirt was pale, maybe pale blue. She described the second man as wearing a t-shirt, with dark hair with blond streaks, slim and tallish and about five feet seven inches. The bigger man hit the other man with the bollard approximately five times; twice when standing, once when falling and twice on the ground. She accepted in cross-examination that she had described the first man at the committal hearing as overweight or obese. She also stated in cross-examination that the man's shirt had a collar and buttons. She also clarified in cross-examination that the man with the bollard did not use a putting action. He brought the bollard down like an axe.

145Ms Whyte was shown seven collections of photographs. In the first collection Ms Whyte identified one photograph as similar to the person kicking the deceased. The collection contained a photograph of Mr Menzies but the photograph selected was of a person other than Mr Menzies. Ms Whyte also viewed a collection that contained a photograph of Mr Aouli but selected a photograph of a person other than Mr Aouli. She did not select any photographs from the third and fourth collections that contained photographs of Messrs Eken and Pirini. She then viewed a collection and selected a picture as the person who ""Bashed a man to death with an instrument"". The picture was of the appellant. She also identified another person in the collection who she described as similar to the person hitting the man with the bollard. However, she was reasonably confident that between the two photos, it was the one of the appellant that was more familiar. She was then shown a collection that included a photograph of Mr Kisacanin and then a collection that included a photograph of Mr Potrus, but she did not identify any photograph in either collection.

146In cross-examination Ms Whyte accepted that when she spoke to police she described the man with the bollard as ""slightly overweight with a pot belly"". She also told police that he was wearing a shirt, not a t-shirt, and that the shirt was possibly blue or pale blue in colour. She accepted that at the committal hearing she described the man as ""obese"". 

147Mr Ireland had been dropped with his wife Marie at Terminal 3. Mr Ireland required wheelchair assistance. Mr Ireland sat on a seat while a Qantas employee helped Mrs Ireland check baggage and obtain boarding passes. Mrs Ireland returned to sit with her husband while they waited for a wheelchair. The seat was just inside the glass walls of the departure hall. 

148Mr Ireland saw a man run along the front of the check-in counters and then disappear behind the booths. He said it appeared there were a number of people brawling. He then saw a man lying in front of him on the ground. A man was standing near his head, neither hindering nor helping. Mr Ireland was continually looking back to make sure that his wife was all right. When he looked back both men were gone. 

149Mr Ireland then saw a man running. When he looked back, after checking on his wife again, the man was lying on the ground in front of him. The man's feet were closest to Mr Ireland and they were about six feet away. The man was wearing darkish clothing and a cap. He then saw a man wearing a darkish singlet run over and look at the man on the ground. After turning back from his wife, he saw a man in white trousers and a white shirt; the man was facing away from Mr Ireland. The man appeared to be fairly tall and well built. The man appeared to have picked up a metal stand and appeared to be ""swinging it across his body from right to left in a slow motion"". Mr Ireland described it as a putting motion and said that he did not know whether it hit the man on the ground. He said that the man in white appeared to swing the metal stand two or three times. 

150In cross-examination Mr Ireland stated that he did not see any fighting going on around the first man on the ground or any people throwing metal bollards. He said that the man in the dark hood would have been lying on the ground for maybe a minute or two with nothing happening to him. He reasserted that the man in white swung the post with a putting action. He stated that he did not see the man on the ground being chased by a number of people. He did not see anyone kicking him. 

151Mrs Ireland was at the departure hall with her husband. They took their bags and sat just inside the door. A little later she noticed a man running behind the counters but she did not see where he went. She then saw a few people pushing one another and moving across towards where she and her husband were sitting. Then a big man came in front of them. She only saw him from the back. He was dressed all in white. He would have been a few feet away. She thought he was moving one arm but was not certain. She could not see his hands. After the man moved away there was a younger man lying on the floor. In cross-examination she stated that she was not certain about whether men were hitting one another with metal posts. She did not see anyone kicking the man on the ground. She said the man in white was leaning over the man but she could not see what he was doing. 

152Patricia Watterson was the Sydney Domestic Airport duty manager at the relevant time. During the changeover with the previous duty manager there was a call on the radio regarding a fight at Gate 3. Ms Watterson heard a commotion in the check-in area. She ran in that direction and noticed bollards on the floor and a man on the ground. After arranging security screens she spoke to an elderly couple. She asked if they saw anything and the gentleman said to her that he remembered one person dressed all in white who had arms as big as legs.

153Jacquelin Magnay travelled on QF430. On the flight she said she saw a man who she described as six feet four or five inches tall, very large, muscular build, of Middle Eastern appearance, wearing a white t-shirt, white tracksuit pants and white shoes, come down the aisle with a second man who wore light grey or brown tracksuit pants and a darker top. She said the second man commented on the pink top that she was wearing. 

154At Sydney Domestic Airport Ms Magnay again observed the man wearing a white top and white tracksuit pants; she noted that he had a large tattoo on the back of his neck that appeared something like an ""infinite symbol"". In the departure hall she saw five bollards being swung in the air at once. She was about 25 or 30 metres from the fighting. She saw a smaller man start to fall and one of the men with a bollard strike him on the head. Ms Magnay said the man used both hands, extended them way beyond the back of his head and used the full force to bring the bollard down. She saw this happen once. As this was happening another man was kicking the man on the ground in the groin and leg area. Another large man, wearing a ripped green shirt, jumped on the back of the man with the bollard. The man who later held the hand of the man on the ground was the same person who was on the back of the man holding the bollard. In cross-examination Ms Magnay stated that she did not see the man with the bollard using a putting motion.

155Matt Zhu travelled on QF430. He viewed the departure hall incident from a few metres from the top of the escalators. He saw two people beating one person. One lifted a steel pole to hit the man on the ground but he could not see if he actually hit the man as his view was obscured. He saw the man lift the pole and bring it down diagonally across his body from right to left more than two times. He described the man as having no or very short hair and he stated he possibly wore a t-shirt. He could not say what colour it was. 

156Tony Wang travelled on QF430 with colleagues Deborah Deng, Matt Zhu and Huai Xi Luo. The fight in the departure hall happened about 20 to 25 metres from where they were standing. Deborah Deng filmed the incident. Mr Wang saw a person lift a pillar to hit somebody. The person's hands were lifted above their head and brought down in front of them; he saw that happen only once. He could not describe the persons involved because of the distance. 

157Deborah Deng stated that at the top of the stairs she took out her digital camera to try to take some footage. The footage taken by Ms Deng was admitted as an exhibit in the proceedings. She otherwise did not give any evidence in relation to the incident involving the bollard. 

(2) The evidence of the informers AL and SP

158In addition, evidence was also given by the two informers, AL and SP. 

159AL at the time was a nominee member of the CMC. On the day in question AL had returned home from church when he received a phone call that he had to go to the Sydney Domestic Airport. In relation to the events in the departure hall AL stated that he saw Mr Menzies, who he referred to as ""Touza"", with his hands around the top of a ""silver thing"", like a rubbish bin. He said that he saw Mr Menzies hit the man on the floor twice. He said that Mr Menzies was facing away from him when he was hitting the man on the floor. The man on the floor was lying on his right side, facing Mr Menzies. AL stated that after he saw the first and second hit he walked out. He stated that he ran out of Terminal 3 with the appellant, Mr Menzies and Frank (presumably La Rosa) and got in a taxi. He stated that in the taxi Mr Menzies said ""I think I killed him"". 

160The cross-examination extensively addressed AL's mental health issues, an occasion when he was hit on the head with an iron bar, an occasion when he was scheduled under the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW), his history of drug use, and his criminal record and history of violence. 

161In cross-examination AL stated that following the appellant being stabbed he was standing by himself and was not kicking or hitting anyone. In cross-examination AL stated he was between two check-in counters when he saw Touza hitting the man on the ground. He stated that he picked up a bollard and threw it but it did not hit anyone. AL accepted in cross-examination that he had told police that Touza had been hitting the man on the ground with a rubbish bin. AL drew a diagram for police of the object that included a hole in which to put rubbish; it was about 30 cm wide. He was unable to describe what Touza was wearing at the time beyond that it was a short-sleeved shirt that maybe was black. AL conceded in cross-examination that in his first interview with police he did not refer to the admission made by Mr Menzies in the taxi.

162SP at the time was a nominee member of the CMC. In relation to the events in the departure hall, SP described seeing Mr Menzies and the appellant with a bollard near the deceased and also Mr Abounader punching the deceased. He said otherwise he did not see anyone else assault the deceased at the Sydney Domestic Airport. 

163SP stated that he could see Mr Menzies and the appellant on the other side of a Qantas banner assaulting the deceased. SP saw that the deceased had fallen to the ground and bollards were being picked up. He saw Mr Menzies with a bollard in his hand bringing the bollard straight down once. He could not see clearly whether it connected with any part of the deceased's body. Mr Menzies was standing up around the head area of the deceased. He described the appellant as being about one metre away and to the left of Mr Menzies. 

164SP stated he also saw the appellant strike the deceased with a bollard once. The appellant used a similar motion, picking it up and striking it down. He did not exactly see if it connected with the deceased. He did not see Mr Menzies leave. He saw the appellant turning around, putting his hand up to his eye and walking towards Peter Zervas with whom he then had an argument.

165In cross-examination SP stated that he did not see anyone kicking the deceased and did not see any blood around the deceased's head. He agreed there were inconsistencies between what he had told police and the events shown in the CCTV footage. SP accepted that he had lied when being cross-examined at the committal proceedings as to whether he attended premises called Gypsy Leather. SP accepted that in an interview with police on 10 July 2009, when he offered to provide assistance, he did not tell police that the appellant had a bollard. He later accepted that in the first police interview he left out details. He accepted he had initially told police that the assault with the bollard had occurred on the opposite side of the check-in counters. He also accepted that in an interview on 24 August 2009 he only spoke of one incident behind the check-in counters and did not refer to a person using a bollard or kicking the deceased. He denied making up a scene of what occurred behind the check-in counters in order to obtain an indemnity. 

166In cross-examination SP was shown footage of the walk-through that police conducted with him. He accepted he had told police that he was at the back of the group leaving the bi-fold doors whereas in fact he was one of the first to leave. He also accepted that the appellant was at the rear of the group, whereas in the walk-through he stated he was at the front. SP accepted there were a number of further inconsistencies between his account at the walk-through and the events recorded on CCTV. SP also accepted he had given a different account in the walk-through compared to his evidence in chief at the trial. For instance, during the walk-through SP stated that Mr Menzies used a bollard behind the check-in counter, then the appellant used a bollard behind the check-in counter, then Mr Abounader stabbed the deceased behind the check-in counter and then both Mr Menzies and the appellant hit the deceased with bollards. SP accepted the evidence he had given in chief was completely different, both in relation to the relevant positions and the order of events. SP accepted that the walk-through began at 1.00 am and it was not until about 2.45 am that he changed his mind as to where he saw the deceased hit with the bollard. 

167SP maintained he had received a telephone call from Mr Potrus on 22 March 2009 to meet, so as to pick up the appellant from Sydney Domestic Airport. SP was shown phone records which disclosed that the only calls between Mr Potrus and SP at the relevant time were in fact made by SP. SP accepted that he did not have a clear view of the events involving the bollards. SP maintained that the deceased had blood all over his t-shirt. He was shown a photograph taken at the scene and accepted that he could not see any blood on the deceased's t-shirt. 

168SP accepted that in 1995 he was convicted of obtaining a benefit by deception. SP accepted that he had not made any contemporaneous notes regarding the events and that he had made mistakes in his evidence. In re-examination SP confirmed that at the time of his offence for obtaining a benefit by deception he was 18 years of age and it concerned $126.05.

(3) Witnesses who provided general descriptions

169Adrian Conti was employed by Qantas and at the time of the incident was stationed at counter 15.

Following the incident Mr Conti collected a number of privacy screens to place around the victim.

170Brigitte Bucukovski travelled on QF430 with her ten year old son. She was standing near a vending machine at the time and caught glimpses of what was happening in front of the check-in counters. She stated that toward the end she saw two arms stretched into the air holding something metal that she later learnt was a bollard. The arms drove the metal down towards the ground with force and she could hear ""a crunching"" and that it was not the floor that the object was hitting. She stated that the object was brought down at least three or four times. As her vision was obstructed, she was unable to describe the man holding the metal object beyond that he was definitely tall for her to have been able to see him. 

171Renee Redford worked as a customer service agent at the time and was rostered to work at counter three which was for Business Class and Qantas Club customers.

173Stephen Merrilees was a medical practitioner and had arrived at Terminal 3 in order to catch a flight. He was in the bag drop queue in the departure hall at the relevant time. He saw three males. One was described as 6 feet or slightly taller, mid 20s, Caucasian, with dark hair and wearing a t-shirt. One of the other men was slightly shorter and of quite a muscular build. The first male punched the second around the neck or face area and a fight erupted between the three persons. A number of other males joined the fight and Mr Merrilees witnessed three altercations. There was a small group, probably five or six males, and there were people swinging bollards. In particular, he saw one person unhook a bollard and throw it at another man. The bollard struck the man across the face and chest. 

174A similar number of people were involved in what Mr Merrilees described as the second fight. However, as a result of movement the number of participants in the second fight was not static. He did not see any bollards used in the second fight. In cross-examination Mr Merrilees was played footage from camera 404 that covered the area where he said the second fight had occurred. He accepted that the footage did not show a fight in that location. 

175In relation to the third fight, Mr Merrilees stated that he saw individuals fighting near the main glass doors. He said the group increased over time and that by the end there were seven or eight individuals fighting. As Mr Merrilees turned back from looking at the incident in which the bollard was thrown, he noticed a man lying on the ground near where the third fight had occurred. Mr Merrilees rendered medical assistance until the ambulance arrived. He did not see anyone involved in the third fight using a bollard.

180During the fight Ms Harris could see bollards being swung out in front of the check-in area. She noticed that there was fighting going on in front of an elderly couple, about a metre in front of them, and she went to try and get them out of the way. In doing so, she noticed the short man lying on the floor. The man in the green singlet was distressed. She stated in cross-examination that she did not see anyone pick up a bollard.

184Luke Cutajar was in the departure hall with his wife and two daughters to catch a flight. The evidence of Kirsty Cutajar is set out above. Mr Cutajar stated that a group of men walked past him and his wife. He later noticed a person with a red hood which the man pulled back whilst he was between the check-in counters. The fighting started and there were about 15 people involved. Mr Cutajar was unable to describe any specific incidents. He did see people swinging bollards.

The second and third men were not as tall but were of a similar build. They were of Middle Eastern or Lebanese appearance. The first man was wearing a white muscle shirt and long trousers. Behind the men he also saw two men of Pacific Islander ethnicity wearing shorts but he did not see where they went.

201A considerable body of evidence was led as to what occurred subsequently. One of the ambulance officers who attended Sydney Domestic Airport and treated the deceased stated that on her arrival the deceased was not breathing, his eyes were open, he was staring and there was no pulse. Multiple stab wounds were noted by medical officers upon examination of the deceased at the hospital. 

202Senior Constable Smith, Crime Scene Investigation Officer, noted that in Terminal 3 in the area south of check-in counters 9 to 28, several metal bollards had been knocked over. She said that privacy screens had been placed around an area near the south wall of the terminal behind which there was medical equipment, a black coloured jumper and red stains which appeared to be blood. She also saw in another area a silver coloured knife on the ground with a partial shoe impression on the blade.

203Protective Services Officer Timothy Jeffcoat was on duty on 22 March 2009. He saw that a bollard had fallen over on its side about one metre from the deceased's head. He did not see any blood on the bollard.

204A post mortem examination was carried out on the deceased on 23 and 24 March 2009 by a Dr Johan Duflou. Dr Duflou listed the cause of death as ""combined effect of blunt force head injury and stab wounds to the chest and abdomen"". His summary of his finding was in the following terms:

""At autopsy there were relevantly minor external injury to the head, but severe and potentially lethal internal head injury, with fracturing of the base of the skull, bleeding over the surface of the brain and bruising and other injury to the brain. There were stab wounds to the right side of the chest and the front of the abdomen. These stabs had resulted in injury to the right lung, the liver, stomach and soft tissues of the abdomen and had caused significant internal bleeding. A number of lesser injuries were also noted on the limbs of the deceased. A small old injury to the frontal lobe of the brain was noted. The deceased was noted to be infected by the Hepatitis C virus. Microscopic examination of tissues showed no additional abnormalities.""

205Dr Duflou described the skull fracture as a hinge fracture. He said the external injuries were relatively minor whilst the internal injury was very severe. He said that something would have had to have been brought down hard on the side of the head causing the fracture in the middle. He said the object would have had to have been relatively flat and brought down with significant force. He said a bollard was consistent with the object he described.

206Importantly Dr Duflou said that if the bollard was swung into the side of the head in a putting motion it was more likely than not that there would be lacerations to the head, not the rest of the body. He stated that there was no fracturing at the top of the head. He said this was indicative of no forceful impact having had occurred with an object, like a bollard, being swung into the top of the head.

The appellant's evidence

207The appellant gave evidence at the trial. He said he knew the deceased and Peter Zervas, saying that he had gone to school with them. He admitted punching and hitting the deceased but said it was because the deceased was coming at him with weapons. He denied hitting the deceased with a bollard or instructing anyone else to do so. He denied telling any CMC members to fight the HA members.

208The appellant admitted he was the President of the CMC.

209The appellant said that on 20 March 2009, Mr Abounader drove him and Mr Aouli to Sydney Domestic Airport. He understood that on their return Mr Abounader would pick them up in Mr Aouli's car. At Melbourne Airport he said he asked Mr Aouli to confirm this. CCTV footage shows Mr Aouli making a telephone call at Melbourne Airport.

210The appellant saw Mr Wainohu when he boarded the plane. He said he did not expect to see him.

211After he was seated there was an announcement that the plane would be late. The appellant said he walked up to Mr Aouli and asked him to let Mr Abounader know that the plane was running late. The appellant told Mr Aouli that Mr Wainohu was on the plane. He admitted when he went back to his seat he looked at Mr Wainohu and may have called his name.

212When the plane landed he could not see Mr Wainohu but could see Mr Aouli. He pointed to his eye to remind Mr Aouli that Mr Wainohu was behind him.

213When shown the CCTV footage, the appellant identified Mr Wainohu leaving the plane first, followed by him and Mr Eken, then Messrs Menzies and Pirini. When he got out of the aerobridge he saw Mr Wainohu with two men that he did not know at the time but he subsequently came to learn were Mr Padovan and Mr Baker. He spoke to Mr Wainohu for about ten seconds. Whilst doing that he saw at least three members of the CMC (SP, AL and Mr Kisacanin), approaching at a fast pace.

214The appellant said he was speaking when Mr Wainohu turned around and walked away. Mr Wainohu put his bag on a carrier and walked back saying, ""I'll show you something"" or ""I've got something"". Mr Wainohu walked straight towards him. The appellant stumbled and threw a punch at Mr Wainohu. Mr Baker threw a punch at AL and AL punched Mr Wainohu and knocked him to the ground.

215The appellant was on the ground with Mr Baker, fighting and wrestling. After about ten seconds they got up. Mr Wainohu walked to the right hand side with Mr Baker and the appellant to the left hand side with Mr Aouli. As the appellant walked east, Mr Padovan walked west. They said to each other, ""Go fuck yourself"".

216The appellant said he caught up with his ""mates"" and Mr Padovan caught up with his. He walked through the bi-fold doors near the rear of his group.

217The appellant said that when he saw the five CMC members coming towards him at Gate 5 he did not know they were coming to meet him. He met up with Mr Potrus and Mr Abounader and told the latter to take him straight to his car. He did not tell anyone to collect his luggage.

218When he came out of the bi-fold doors he went straight because he was following the others. At the point when he reached the last of the economy check-in counters, he did not know there were HA members in front of him. 

219As he moved east he recognised Peter Zervas and the deceased. The deceased and another man walked straight past them. Peter Zervas then shouted words along the lines of, ""Where do you think you're f'ing going? Do you think you can just walk away? You're dogs"". The appellant said he moved forward saying, ""Get fucked, what is it to you"". He did not think there was going to be a fight.

220The appellant said that Peter Zervas ran straight at him with his hands in his pockets and stopped about a metre in front of him. The appellant said he took three or four steps backwards. Peter Zervas had a knuckleduster and Mr Abounader yelled, ""He's got a gun, he's going to shoot"".

221The appellant said he started running, looking back as he did. As the appellant looked back he saw the deceased swing his hand over the appellant's face. The appellant blocked it with his hand and his hand was cut open. The appellant said the same blow ""sort of got me in the right eye"". He went through the check-in counters backwards with Peter Zervas and the deceased, the latter still going at him with whatever he had in his hand. As they got to the front of the check-in counter the deceased dropped his weapon and ""took off"". Peter Zervas picked up a bollard and smashed the appellant in the back.

222As he untangled himself from luggage, the appellant found himself in a fight with the deceased and Mr Khoury. Mr Khoury was trying to hold him as the deceased was going at him with another weapon. Mr Pirini came from behind the deceased and took him off the appellant.

223The appellant was shown the Deng video (see par [266] below). He said the footage showed his back as he headed to the nearest exit of Terminal 3. He acknowledged he could see on the footage someone lifting something in the air but denied seeing it at the time. When he was exiting the door he said he looked back in the terminal. He did not notice anything happening where the deceased was killed. He said AL was running away from Peter Zervas who was saying ""Come back in and fight you pussies"" or ""Come back in you f'ing dogs, come back in and fight. Don't go, come back in and fight"". AL, Mr Menzies and Mr La Rosa were in the taxi with him. He did not hear Mr Menzies say anything about what had happened at the airport. He went to his parents' home where he washed and changed. He had blood on his face, neck, arms and in his hair. They were in his words, ""all blood"".

224He denied using a bollard on the deceased or directing anyone else to use a bollard on him. 

225In cross-examination the appellant was shown a schedule of calls between CMC members. He agreed that after the call that was made from Mr Aouli to Mr Abounader a number of CMC members met at Brighton and then arrived at Sydney Domestic Airport. He said he did not know that those people were coming to the airport.

226The appellant agreed that he knew if he hit Mr Wainohu other loyal members of his club would come in and start fighting. He agreed that Mr Menzies was someone he could depend on in a situation like that. 

227He agreed that in the fight that took place outside Gate 5 both Mr Wainohu and Mr Baker were hit to the ground and stayed on the ground. He maintained he was on the ground for five to ten seconds. He did not admit that he was angry. 

228The appellant agreed that he was the person Mr Kroeger was describing when he described a man saying, ""You're dead, you are fucking dead"". However, he did not recall saying, ""Next time we see you you're going to have bullet holes through you. You're a dead man walking"". He said he could have said anything.

229The appellant denied he went in the direction he took after entering the departure hall because he was looking for HA members. He stated it was a coincidence that he ran into them behind the check-in counters on the way to the car. He said he had not had discussions with anyone about leaving their luggage at the airport. 

230The appellant was asked about the footage which showed 12 CMC members speeding up and walking towards the HA members. He was directed to a man in black coming from the rear of the group and acknowledged what he was saying was the three people joined his group and ran with him. He said he did not stop until Peter Zervas ran at him.

231He denied he was so angry and worked up that he did not care that he was in a public place. He denied that he had already decided at Gate 5 that he was going to fight the HA members and that he had contemplated the possibility that one of the CMC members would inflict some really serious injury on the HA members, or at least intended to assault them in some way.

232He agreed that when the deceased assaulted him with a pair of scissors he put his arm up to deflect it, but he denied he got a red eye and a scratch on his triceps. He said:

""No when he [Peter Zervas] started running towards me, I stopped and then he stopped about a metre in front of me and I walked back. Then he took his hands out of his pocket, he had a knuckleduster on so I walked back again and someone said there was a gun, so I run"". 

He said the deceased was swinging a blade at his face. He agreed he was 186 cm tall (that was later corrected to 178 cm) and the deceased was 161 cm. He could not demonstrate how the swinging occurred.

233He said that both SP and AL were wrong in their evidence that he was standing still when the deceased attacked him. He denied the fighting broke out when the deceased struck at him. He agreed that both Peter Zervas and the deceased were fighting with him. He agreed that the effect of his evidence was that none of the other CMC members came to help him.

234In relation to his evidence that Mr Khoury was trying to hold him while the deceased was going at him with another weapon near the front door, the appellant agreed that not a single witness had said they had seen a person being attacked with a sharp weapon on the street side. He did not remember if Mr Menzies came in behind the check-in counters and grabbed the deceased's jumper and got the deceased off him. He denied seeing the deceased get away and being chased near the glass wall. He had no idea how the deceased came to be on the ground. He said he did not see the assault on the deceased. He did not see the deceased being kicked and punched and hit with a bollard. The appellant denied that he ran over and was part of the final assault on the deceased by using a bollard, either by hitting him or putting it in front of Mr and Mrs Ireland.

235He was shown the Deng video and agreed that he was the man in white, next to the man in black with his arms raised over his head. He said he could not see what was happening.

236The appellant denied that the actions of the day were as a result of decisions made by him.

237The appellant agreed that none of his blood was found at Sydney Domestic Airport and he did not tell the police of his injuries. He said his lawyers told him not to discuss the matters with the police.

Mr Menzies' evidence

238Mr Menzies gave evidence. He said on the return journey from Melbourne he was wearing a short-sleeved black t-shirt with ""Ed Hardy"" written on the front in ""whitey-creamy beigey"" running writing, with an embroidered tiger's head underneath. He agreed that a photo showed a t-shirt similar to the one he was wearing. He said he was wearing grey Nike tracksuit pants and white and blue socks and ""Shox"" shoes. He was wearing a gold necklace and gold bracelet on his left wrist and an earring in each ear.

239Mr Menzies denied that he knew Mr Wainohu when he boarded the flight. He did not have knuckledusters or a knife with him when he boarded the plane. He said his phone was in his (checked in) luggage.

240Mr Menzies said he went to sleep in the aircraft. He said he was not aware of any confrontation on the plane. He said he was last off the plane out of the people in his group and was planning to take a taxi home.

241When Mr Menzies disembarked he saw the appellant talking to Mr Wainohu. He said Mr Wainohu said something like, ""I've got something in my bag, I've got something for you"". He said Mr Wainohu barged into the appellant. AL came out of nowhere and king-hit Mr Wainohu who fell to the ground. AL then hit Mr Padovan. He said the fight lasted less than a minute and was not much of a fight.

242Mr Menzies said he believed there were cameras everywhere, and security. He said he wanted to get out of Sydney Domestic Airport. He did not know the people at Gate 5 were HA members. He did not remember meeting up with anyone after they went through the bi-fold doors, although he acknowledged the CCTV camera showed that he had.

243Mr Menzies was shown CCTV footage and identified himself as walking on the left-hand side of the group behind the check-in counters. He said he stayed at the same speed. He saw another group and said he did not know them or that they were HA members.

244Mr Menzies said that when his group approached the other group the man in the green singlet ""was screaming out, swearing and the other lad in the black jumper was jumping around and running towards us sort of, in our direction"".

245Mr Menzies' group stopped in front of the others and they also stopped. As the person in the black jumper was coming he pulled his hood over his head. He came from Mr Menzies' left side, he was ""jumping, sort of"". Mr Menzies said the man was standing there for about four seconds and then he heard Mr Abounader say, ""Watch out, he's got a nug, he's going to shoot, he's got a gun"". 

246Mr Menzies said he froze. He said the appellant and the other men took ""off through the check-ins"". He said the man in the black jumper had something sharp in his hand and took a swing at the appellant's head. The appellant put his hand up and it connected with his hand.

247Mr Menzies said there was a big scuffle, everyone was throwing punches. When everyone got off the ground he noticed Mr Eken was still on the floor, on his back with someone on top of him. Mr Menzies grabbed the man on top of him and punched him so he got off Mr Eken. He then had a fight with that man and fell on his backside and they had a scuffle on the floor. They both got up, shaped up to each other and Mr Menzies said he took off.

248Mr Menzies was shown Exhibit 20 (a PowerPoint slide of a photograph taken by Ms Magnay, which identified a person matching Mr Menzies' description in the departure hall in front of the check-in counters). He said at that time he was headed ""out the door"". He said he was not carrying anything and did not have a weapon. Mr Menzies said he did not see anyone strike the deceased with a bollard. He denied that whilst he was in a taxi leaving Sydney Domestic Airport he said, ""I think I killed him"". Mr Menzies claimed the appellant said, ""He tried to kill me"".

249Mr Menzies denied saying anything to anyone at the home of the appellant's parents about having killed or murdered anyone.

250Mr Menzies said he did not touch anyone behind the check-in counters. He admitted to fighting in front of the check-in counters. He denied using a weapon or picking up or using a bollard. He denied any involvement in the killing of the deceased.

251In cross-examination Mr Menzies denied that the reason he could not produce a photograph of his t-shirt was that he had destroyed it.

252Mr Menzies acknowledged that he was aware of an ongoing hostility between the CMC and the HA. However, he again stated he did not know who Mr Wainohu was.

253Mr Menzies acknowledged he was the person described by Mr Anderson as sitting in seat 44F. He did not agree that he and the person in seat 44E attempted to leave the plane quickly. Notwithstanding CCTV footage, he did not agree he was moving faster than other passengers when getting off the aerobridge.

254Mr Menzies agreed the footage showed him only four seconds behind the appellant but said by the time he caught up to the appellant, the appellant was already talking to Mr Wainohu. He denied the appellant's evidence that everyone was fighting and that that included Mr Menzies.

255Mr Menzies also said in cross-examination that he saw SP, AL and Mr Pirini fighting outside Gate 5. He agreed his earlier evidence was that he had only said SP and AL were fighting outside that gate. 

256Mr Menzies said as there was a fight he decided not to get his luggage. The only discussion between him and other members of the group was someone said, ""Let's get the fuck out of the airport, let's get out of here the cops are coming"". He said it was the appellant who said, ""Let's get the fuck out of the airport"".

257Mr Menzies said he did not recognise anyone behind the check-in counters. He did not notice that the singlet worn by Peter Zervas was a HA singlet. He denied he would recognise a HA t-shirt or insignia.

258Mr Menzies agreed the two groups came together. He was focused on the deceased. He said the deceased pulled a knife and attacked the appellant from behind whilst the appellant was arguing with Peter Zervas. He said the appellant put up his hand and blocked it and shuffled backwards through the check-in counters. Mr Menzies said he walked (and on other occasions, ran) through a different check-in counter closer to the bi-fold doors. 

259When Mr Menzies heard someone say, ""He's going to shoot, he's got a nug"" he froze and then started to walk through the check-in counter. Everyone was on the other side when he got through. He agreed he was headed in the same direction as whoever was supposed to have a gun.

260Mr Menzies denied he grabbed the deceased after the deceased struck at the appellant. He knew that a matching DNA profile had been found on the deceased's jacket but maintained he did not grab the deceased or stab or otherwise touch him. He denied he came through the check-in counter in a group. He did not see the deceased get away, being chased by other CMC members and fall or be hit to the floor. He denied he ran over and joined in the assault.

261Mr Menzies agreed by reference to Exhibit GT (a photograph of the departure hall) that he was running towards where the deceased had died, but denied he was doing so to join in the assault on him. He agreed he ran in that direction before the deceased was assaulted.

262Mr Menzies said he did not see bollards being used whilst he was in the departure hall. He denied that he was part of the fatal assault because he was party to an agreement with his fellow CMC members to inflict serious injuries on HA members. He repeated that he had no idea they were HA members whilst he was in the terminal.

CCTV footage of the riot and fatal assault

263I referred earlier to the CCTV footage shortly after the CMC members left the secure area. Footage taken immediately thereafter shows the 12 CMC members moving behind the check-in counters, initially walking before speeding up. 

264The CCTV footage shows the deceased moving towards the CMC members followed by the other HA members. The deceased is shown putting his hood up. At the same time the CMC members can be seen moving towards the HA members. The deceased and another man are seen moving behind the CMC members. A man in white and other unidentified figures are also seen to be moving.

265Having passed that group, CCTV footage shows the deceased moving back towards the group. It also shows Peter Zervas moving towards that group. The footage captures the appellant retreating twice before the deceased is seen to run in to attack him.

266Regrettably the CCTV cameras were not in operation in the area in which the fatal attack took place. However, the incident was filmed by a visiting Chinese lawyer, Ms Deng (the Deng video). The Deng video is by no means clear. However, it does show a man in dark clothing with his arms raised to the fullest extent and a man in white in the background in the area where the deceased was fatally attacked. The man's arms that were raised then descend out of view. The man in white then appears to be moving away from the deceased's location towards the centre exit. The man in white disappears through the exit.

Grounds 1 and 2 of the grounds of appeal 

267Grounds 1 and 2 of the grounds of appeal are as follows:

""Ground 1: The verdict of the jury with respect to Count 1 is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

Ground 2: When regard is had to the verdicts of the jury in relation to the co-accused and the manner in which the Crown case was left to the jury at trial, the verdict of the jury with respect to Count 1 was a miscarriage of justice.""

268It is convenient to deal with each of these grounds together.

The appellant's submissions

269The appellant placed great stress on the manner in which the Crown presented its case at trial. He submitted that what was put against him was a case of either liability on the basis that he was the person who inflicted the fatal blow on the deceased, or alternatively liability for murder as a result of a joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise arising out of an agreement or understanding between him and the five other CMC members charged with the murder. In that context, the Crown made the following remarks in opening: 

""The Crown says in this case that you would at least be satisfied that such an understanding or arrangement had been formed from the time that Mahmoud Hawi called out the threats to the Hells Angels after the gate 5 affray but, members of the jury, on the Crown case it will be open to you to find that the agreement was formed spontaneously at any time after the fighting had broken out behind the check-in counters.""

270The appellant pointed to the ten points relied upon by the Crown at the trial as establishing his guilt and those of the other CMC members charged. The first point was the underlying animosity between the two motorcycle clubs. The second was the events on QF430 as described by the witnesses to whose evidence I have referred in pars [32]-[50] above.

271The third point was that Mr Kisacanin, Mr Abounader and Mr Potrus came to Sydney Domestic Airport knowing of the possibility of an incident with the HA members. The fourth point was that the CMC members started the affray at Gate 5. The fifth was the threats made at the end of the affray at Gate 5 (with particular reference to the evidence of Edem and Eyiram Dokli, Ms Magnay, Ms Osborn, Mr Kroeger and Mr Stephenson to which I have referred above).

272The sixth point was that the CMC members, rather than retrieving their luggage, walked towards the HA members, advancing on them intending a confrontation. The seventh point was that the CMC members stopped when they saw the HA members because they were expecting a confrontation. The eighth point was that the descriptions of the fight given by the eye-witnesses were inconsistent with the CMC members running away from the risk of a firearm or the deceased coming back at the appellant a second time.

273The ninth point was that the CMC members left together, while the tenth was that the CMC had a hierarchal structure.

274The appellant also referred to the direction of the trial judge on the issue of joint criminal enterprise:

""In this case, the Crown says that there was a joint criminal enterprise. The object of it was to inflict grievous bodily harm upon a member, or members, of those who were in the Hells Angels group. That group included the deceased. It says that this joint enterprise was in existence at the time the fatal injuries and wounds were inflicted upon the deceased. It says that each of the six accused were parties to this joint enterprise and participated in some way in it. It also says that the fatal injuries and wounds were inflicted upon the deceased by a person, or persons, who were also parties to the joint enterprise. It does not matter whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to whether a particular accused inflicted the fatal injuries or wounds; simply that you are satisfied to that standard that they were inflicted by someone who was also a participant in the enterprise.""

275The appellant emphasised that in these circumstances the Crown case on joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise was limited to an agreement or understanding between only the six accused CMC members, and that the agreement or understanding was reached at least at Gate 5.

276The appellant also noted that the Crown relied upon the doctrine of extended joint criminal enterprise as a result of an agreement or understanding reached between the same CMC members where lesser violence was contemplated but each accused contemplated the possibility that other participants might intentionally inflict grievous bodily harm.

277The appellant noted that the Crown case against Mr Menzies and Mr Abounader was that they were liable to be convicted either by way of direct involvement in the murder, joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise. He noted that the case against Mr Kisacanin, Mr Potrus and Mr Eken was based at the very least on extended joint criminal enterprise.

278Although the case against Mr Abounader based on direct involvement was put on the basis that he stabbed the deceased, the case against the appellant and Mr Menzies was put on the basis that they inflicted fatal blows on the deceased with a bollard. However, in the case based on joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise, the jury was directed that the scope did not extend to inflicting grievous bodily harm by stabbing and that they should put that cause of death to one side, effectively limiting the act causing death to a blunt force head injury inflicted by a bollard.

279The appellant noted that the Crown also put the case on the basis that if the jury was not satisfied on the murder count, a manslaughter verdict was open. This was provided they were satisfied there was a joint criminal enterprise to assault and they were also satisfied that it carried an appreciable risk of serious injury. Alternatively, if the agreement was to intimidate the HA members and the jury was satisfied that the appellant participated in some way, contemplated the possibility that someone might intentionally assault one or more HA members and the assault was a dangerous and unlawful act with the appreciable risk of serious injury, the jury could then convict him of manslaughter. 

280The appellant submitted that the jury's decision to acquit Messrs Potrus, Eken and Kisacanin of both murder and manslaughter meant the jury rejected the argument that all six CMC members were liable for murder or manslaughter on the basis of joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise involving an agreement or understanding between all six CMC members. The appellant submitted the same reasoning must have applied to the decision of the jury to acquit Mr Menzies and Mr Abounader of murder and their failure to reach agreement on a verdict of manslaughter. He submitted that as a matter of logic this would lead to the rejection of the Crown case against him based on joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise. He emphasised that it was the Crown case against him that as a result of joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise the actus reus of Mr Menzies, as the person bludgeoning the deceased with a bollard, was attributed to him.

281The appellant submitted that the rejection of the Crown case based on joint criminal enterprise and extended joint criminal enterprise was hardly surprising given the following matters. 

282First, the limited nature of the affray at Gate 5 and the fact that it stopped without any significant harm being caused to the HA members present. Second, the unlikelihood that the CMC members would seek to engage in a riot at such a location. Third (and somewhat contradictorily) the availability of bollards outside Gate 5 which could have been used had there been an agreement to inflict grievous bodily harm. 

283Fourth, the CCTV footage of the approach of the CMC members after they entered the bi-fold doors was consistent with a lack of aggression and an initial unawareness of HA members being ahead of them. The appellant also noted the route that the CMC members took was broadly consistent with the way a number of them had entered Terminal 3 that afternoon. 

284Fifth, AL and SP denied any such agreement or intent amongst the CMC members. Sixth, there was no immediate violence when the CMC members first encountered the HA members in the departure hall. The appellant also pointed out that the group first ignored the deceased when he walked past them in contrast to the deceased who pulled his hood over his head and ran towards the CMC members in a hostile manner. Seventh, the CMC members were unarmed except for Mr Abounader and, finally, there were real difficulties in establishing that the scope of any agreed infliction of harm included the use of a bollard.

285The appellant pointed to the fact that all parties to the trial ultimately agreed that based on the Deng video, the man visibly wielding the bollard and striking down on the deceased was wearing dark clothing and was not the appellant.

286The appellant pointed out that it was the Crown case that the disputed use of the bollard and the striking of the deceased evinced an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm inconsistent with self-defence. The appellant submitted that if some members of the jury reasoned it was a reasonable possibility that Mr Menzies thought it was necessary to defend himself, but could not agree that his acts were excessive, this may explain the hung verdict on manslaughter. However the appellant submitted that such reasoning would have been even stronger in his own case. The appellant submitted it was far more likely that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Menzies was involved in the acts causing the death of the deceased.

287In relation to what he described as ""direct liability"", the appellant referred to the evidence which I have summarised above. The appellant submitted that the evidence could not lead to the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that he was actively involved in the killing of the deceased. 

288In particular, he submitted that evidence capable of supporting such a conclusion was in conflict with that of other witnesses and inconsistent with the Deng video. He stated that the Crown accepted that a bollard was not swung into the deceased's head in the putting manner described by Mr Ireland. This was a reference to the statement by the Crown Prosecutor in her closing address that there was no sign of forcible impact on the top of the head or on the face and there were no external marks on the head indicating that the bollard was swung into the head in a putting type motion. He submitted that, given the jury verdict with regard to Mr Menzies, it was clear that the evidence of AL and SP was not accepted.

289The appellant submitted that the only other possible basis for liability was that the appellant entered into an agreement with one or more of the accused CMC members who actually inflicted the fatal injuries; such an agreement arising only after the attack on the appellant by the deceased. He submitted that such a verdict would be contrary to the assumption that the jury followed judicial directions. 

290The appellant referred to paragraph 57 of the remarks on sentence of the trial judge. However, those remarks need to be read in the context of the preceding paragraph. The relevant paragraphs are as follows:

""[56] The Crown relied upon other evidence to support the proposition that the offender was involved in the fatal assault. It is unnecessary to refer to more. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was in the immediate presence of the deceased when the assault occurred. I am not satisfied that he was the person who inflicted the blow, or blows, which caused the fractured skull. The person who did that was the person to whom I referred earlier who was tall and had dark clothing on his upper body. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender inflicted any blows at all. I am satisfied that the person referred to in the evidence of Mr and Mrs Ireland was the offender but they did not actually see any blows make contact with the deceased. 

[57] I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what occurred was this. One of the Comancheros rammed a bollard into the head of the deceased one or more times by raising and lowering it and striking him with the base of it. This caused the fractured skull. The offender contributed to the actions of this man by either joining in the assault by attempting, at least, to strike the deceased, or by simply being there when it was occurring. His presence would undoubtedly have had the effect of authorising and approving the actions of the other man who bludgeoned Anthony Zervas to death. Having seen the deceased being dealt with in that fashion, he turned and walked towards the exit, exchanged some threats with Peter Zervas, and then hurriedly left.""

291The appellant submitted that the trial judge's conclusion that he contributed to the actions of the perpetrator either by joining the assault, by attempting to at least strike the deceased or by simply being there when it was occurring, illustrated that the verdict was unsafe. He submitted that his presence nearby said nothing about his mens rea. The footage depicting him as being present and walking away was not evidence supporting an agreement to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased.

292The appellant also submitted that such a conclusion was not open for the following reasons:

(a)The time between the attack on the appellant by the deceased and the appellant's appearance on the Deng video when the deceased appeared to have been struck by the bollard was about 34-35 seconds.

(b)During that period the appellant was engaged in resisting the attack on him by the deceased, if not others, for at least some of that time.

(c)There were no bollards behind the check-in counter where the appellant was initially attacked, thus further limiting the time for such an agreement to have been reached.

(d)CCTV footage 414 suggested that the participants moved rapidly to the location where the deceased was killed suggesting the actions of the person who struck the deceased with a bollard occurred almost as soon as the deceased arrived at the location.

(e)The Deng video depicted the appellant departing immediately after the blow. His movement was directed to leaving the terminal. His actions provide no support for such an agreement.

293Senior counsel for the appellant emphasised the manner in which the case had been put at the trial and stated it was too late to put a different case. He submitted there were only three ways the appellant was said to be liable to be convicted at the trial for murder. The first, he submitted, was by the infliction of the blows which brought about the death.

294In relation to the second and third ways in which the appellant was said by the Crown to be liable, namely, as a result of a joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise, senior counsel for the appellant emphasised the way the case was put was that the agreement or understanding was reached at Gate 5. He submitted that it was no part of the Crown case that it was an instantaneous agreement made at the time the bollard was brought down on the deceased's head. It should be noted, however, that one reference in the Crown Prosecutor's closing address that was relied on in this context referred to the fact that the agreement could be formed spontaneously.

295Senior counsel for the appellant emphasised the fact that only the six persons standing trial for murder were said to be participants. He said there could not be a verdict of murder for any of the six unless they were a participant and continued to be so up until the act in question was committed by the co-participant. In that context, senior counsel for the appellant submitted that it was necessary to establish that the striker was one of the participants to the agreement. He submitted that the verdict in favour of the other alleged participants excluded any possibility of liability by way of joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise.

296Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the only persons put forward by the Crown as striking the deceased with a bollard were the appellant and Mr Menzies. He submitted that in those circumstances the appellant could only be convicted on the basis of joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise if Mr Menzies was convicted.

297Senior counsel for the appellant submitted it was not open to the jury to convict on the basis that they were satisfied that the six accused were parties to a joint criminal enterprise but they could not determine who was the striker. This was because there was no evidence from which one could ""close the class"" and limit the possible striker down to the six said to be participants in the agreement, as opposed to the other CMC members involved in the incident that were not tried with the appellant (described at pars [16]-[22] above).

298In relation to ""direct liability"", senior counsel for the appellant reviewed the evidence which I have summarised above. He submitted that it was not capable of giving rise to the conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had inflicted the fatal blow. In particular, he referred to Mr Ireland's evidence and pointed out that Mr Ireland did not see any violence and spoke about a putting motion which was quite different from other witnesses and inconsistent with the Deng video. Senior counsel also emphasised it was at odds with the evidence of SP. He submitted that the evidence of SP to the extent that it asserted the appellant was striking the deceased with an up and down motion was contrary to the Deng video. He emphasised that the jury did not accept the evidence of SP relating to the participation of Mr Menzies so as to ground a finding beyond reasonable doubt.

299Senior counsel for the appellant emphasised there was no case based on accessorial liability as distinct from joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise.

The Crown's submissions

300The Crown submitted that the absence of a finding identifying the person who wielded the bollard did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the guilty verdict against the appellant constituted a miscarriage of justice. In written submissions it was submitted that the guilty verdict for murder was sustainable on the basis that the appellant was armed with a bollard and was present with a man who inflicted the fatal injuries (the bollard man) and contributed by attempting to strike the deceased and by being present and available to assist the bollard man ""to inflict serious injury"".

301In making this submission the Crown relied, amongst other things, on the evidence of what occurred on the aircraft, the affray outside Gate 5 and, in particular, the evidence of Mr Ireland that the appellant had a bollard in his hand which he was swinging from right to left in a slow motion. The Crown submitted that its contention was supported by the Deng video which the Crown submitted showed the appellant did not move from the vicinity of the man wielding the bollard until he brought the bollard down.

302The Crown also relied in this context on the evidence of Ms Wattison, Ms Gray, SP and various other witnesses to the fight whose evidence I have summarised above.

303Senior counsel for the Crown commenced his submissions by stating that whilst he was not formally conceding that joint criminal enterprise as it was run at the trial was not open, his submissions would be directed to an alternative basis arising from the fact that the appellant was present when another person inflicted the fatal blow. However, he did not put this on the basis of accessorial liability. He put it on the basis that an agreement or understanding was spontaneously formed between the person who delivered the blow and the appellant just before the blow was delivered. However he acknowledged that the spontaneous agreement had to be between the appellant and one of his five co-accused.

304In stating it was open to the jury to convict on this basis, senior counsel for the Crown referred to a statement by the trial judge in his summing-up. The statement was to the effect that the existence of a joint criminal enterprise may be inferred from all the circumstances, the circumstances of joint participation may be an unspoken understanding or arrangement then and there to commit the crime and to the fact that no conversation was necessary. In this context he relied on Mr Ireland's evidence that the appellant was swinging a bollard.

305Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the acquittal of Mr Menzies on the charge of murder was not inconsistent with the conviction of the appellant based on joint criminal enterprise if the fatal blow was struck by Mr Menzies. He submitted the actus rea would be attributed to the appellant who had the necessary mens rea. It would not matter that Mr Menzies had a partial defence. However, senior counsel for the Crown accepted that the trial judge was correct in directing that for a criminal enterprise to be established, the jury would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one of the parties to the agreement inflicted grievous bodily harm upon a member of the HA (unlawfully, that is not in self-defence).

306Senior counsel for the Crown accepted the Crown case at trial was that the persons who were actively involved in the killing were Mr Menzies and the appellant with bollards and Mr Abounader with a knife.

Consideration

307The principles on which an appellate court is required to deal with a ground of appeal that a verdict was unreasonable are now well established. They were set out by the High Court in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 (M) and have been consistently reaffirmed since that time. They were summarised by a majority of the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 (SKA) in the following terms:

""[11] It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.'

[12] This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to 'unsafe or unsatisfactory' in M is to be taken as 'equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as ""unreasonable"" or such as ""cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"".'

[13] The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.'

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.

[14] In determining an appeal pursuant to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make 'an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality'. In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated:

'In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand.'""
(References omitted).

308It is not enough for the verdict to be unreasonable that a review of the evidence shows that it was open to the jury to reach a different conclusion. That was made clear by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [113]. However, it is equally clear that it is not sufficient that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. That was made clear in M, cited in SKA at [13]. If, after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury as the fact finder, the court is left in reasonable doubt as to the verdict, it is only where the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving that doubt, that the court can conclude there was no miscarriage of justice (see also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 (MFA) at [26] and [55]-[56]). 

309The question of inconsistent verdicts the subject of Ground 2 raises particular issues. However, it must be remembered that the test prescribed by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is that the verdict in question is unreasonable, not that it is inconsistent with another verdict given by the jury: MFA at [36].

310In MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348 (MacKenzie) at 365-368 the issues surrounding inconsistent verdicts were extensively considered by Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ. While it is unnecessary to cite the whole of the passage of their Honour's judgment, a number of matters should be emphasised. 

311First, where inconsistency arises in the jury verdict upon different counts in the originating process in a criminal trial the question of whether the inconsistent verdicts can be reconciled is one of logic and reasonableness (MacKenzie at 366 citing R v Stone, Unreported, Court of Appeal Criminal Division England and Wales, 13 December 1954, per Devlin J). 

312Second, respect for the function the law assigns to jurors has led to the reluctance of appellate courts to accept a submission that the verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. If there is a proper way to reconcile the verdicts, allowing the court to conclude the jury performed its function as required, that conclusion would generally be accepted (MacKenzie at 367). 

313Third, there is however a residue of cases where the different verdicts reached represent an affront to logic and commonsense. It is when the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside (MacKenzie at 368).

314Further, the issue should be considered on the assumption that juries understand and follow the directions given by the trial judge: Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [13] and HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334 at [52] and [353].

315It will be necessary to say something more on the question of inconsistency of verdicts. However, it is convenient to deal first with the question of liability for murder on the basis that the appellant inflicted a blow which killed or contributed to the death of the deceased.

Did the appellant strike the deceased with a bollard? 

316It was no part of the Crown case that the appellant stabbed the deceased. It was only contended that he inflicted a blow or blows with a bollard which caused the death.

317I have reviewed the evidence above and as a consequence have been left with a doubt that the appellant struck the deceased with a bollard.

318I do not propose to repeat the evidence to which I have referred to above. However, a number of matters should be emphasised. First, as I pointed out, the evidence of Ms Gray who described a man with light coloured pants as a person who brought the bollard down on the deceased was inconsistent with her earlier statement to the police. Second, Mr Barnes, who said he saw a man in a white top in the vicinity of the deceased when he was struck, acknowledged in cross-examination that he did not see the man in the white top involved in the incident with the man on the ground.

319Third, George Teale, who described the incident in which the deceased was struck with a bollard, stated that two men were hitting the deceased with bollards, describing one as wearing whitish pants without a shirt. No one suggested the appellant was not wearing a shirt at the time the assault on the deceased occurred. Further, George Teale's statement to the police was that he saw only one person with a bollard, in light coloured pants and could not identify that person from police photographs.

320Ms Whyte identified a picture of the appellant as the man who hit the deceased with a bollard. She said the man she saw did not use a putting motion; rather he brought the bollard down like an axe. However, her description of the assailant at trial was inconsistent with the description of the appellant, as was the description of the assailant which she gave to the police and at the committal hearing.

321I have set out the evidence of SP above. Effectively he stated that two men were striking the deceased with a bollard in a similar fashion, identifying them as Mr Menzies and the appellant. No other person gave evidence to this effect. It is not apparent from the Deng video. I have referred to the other inconsistencies and difficulties with the evidence of SP above. Even taking into account the advantage the jury had in seeing SP and hearing his evidence, that does not resolve any reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant was the person who brought the bollard down on the deceased.

322Ms McCarthy, whose version of events most closely resembled the Deng video, identified two men standing next to each other but only one wielding a bollard. However, she was unable to identify either man when looking at photographs.

323The evidence I have referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this section of this judgment is the evidence, in my view, most favourable to the Crown to support the contention that the appellant hit the deceased with a bollard using an up and down motion. Having regard to the uncertainties and inconsistencies in this evidence, even taking it on its own, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant struck the deceased in that fashion.

324That, however, is not the only evidence. I have summarised the balance above. That evidence either does not identify any person swinging a bollard in an up and down motion or, to the extent that such evidence was given, it was contrary to the person being the appellant.

325The Deng video is of considerable significance. I have studied it a number of times. As I pointed out it shows a man wearing dark clothes with his arms raised. It does show a man in white standing next to him but not with raised arms. It does not assist in establishing that the appellant inflicted a fatal blow by using the bollard in an up and down motion. 

326There remains however the evidence of Mr Ireland who, as I indicated, saw a person answering the description of the deceased picking up a metal stand and swinging it across his body from right to left in what he described as a putting motion. This evidence was not inconsistent with what appeared on the Deng video. That footage is incapable of resolving whether or not the man in white is moving in a manner consistent or inconsistent with a putting motion. Further, Mr Ireland said he did not see the metal bollard hit the deceased, and Ms Whyte and Ms Magnay (who were in close proximity to Mr Ireland) said that they did not see a man using bollards with a putting motion. No other witness described a bollard being used with a putting motion. 

327In these circumstances I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant inflicted fatal blows on the deceased using a bollard with a putting motion. Further, Dr Duflou's evidence that had the bollard been swung directly into the head of the deceased he would have expected to see lacerations to the head, casts further doubt on this proposition.

328In the circumstances, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant inflicted fatal blows to the head of the deceased using a bollard. It is a doubt I believe the jury should have held and it was not open for the appellant to be convicted on the basis that he inflicted the fatal blow or some of the blows which caused death.

Liability on the basis of joint criminal enterprise

329The extent and scope of what has been described as joint criminal enterprise was stated by the plurality in the decision of the High Court in McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; (1995) 183 CLR 108. In that case the plurality stated the relevant principles in the following terms at 113-114:

""The doctrine of common purpose applies where a venture is undertaken by more than one person acting in concert in pursuit of a common criminal design. Such a venture may be described as a joint criminal enterprise. Those terms - common purpose, common design, concert, joint criminal enterprise - are used more or less interchangeably to invoke the doctrine which provides a means, often an additional means, of establishing the complicity of a secondary party in the commission of a crime. The liability which attaches to the traditional classifications of accessory before the fact and principal in the second degree may be enough to establish the guilt of a secondary party: in the case of an accessory before the fact where that party counsels or procures the commission of the crime and in the case of a principal in the second degree where that party, being present at the scene, aids or abets its commission. But the complicity of a secondary party may also be established by reason of a common purpose shared with the principal offender or with that offender and others. Such a common purpose arises where a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between that person and another or others that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances. If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission. 

Not only that, but each of the parties to the arrangement or understanding is guilty of any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose. Initially the test of what fell within the scope of the common purpose was determined objectively so that liability was imposed for other crimes committed as a consequence of the commission of the crime which was the primary object of the criminal venture, whether or not those other crimes were contemplated by the parties to that venture. However, in accordance with the emphasis which the law now places upon the actual state of mind of an accused person, the test has become a subjective one and the scope of the common purpose is to be determined by what was contemplated by the parties sharing that purpose.""
(References omitted).

330The effect of the judgment was summarised by the plurality in Likiardopoulos v The Queen [2012] HCA 37; (2012) 247 CLR 265 as follows:

""[19] On the principal case, the appellant was liable for the murder of the deceased under the principle of criminal responsibility variously described as joint criminal enterprise, common purpose or concert. On this analysis, it was necessary to prove that the appellant was a party to an understanding or arrangement, whether formed expressly or tacitly, with John Likiardopoulos, Aydin and Singh, to inflict really serious injury on the deceased and that, while that arrangement was on foot, one or more of the parties to it did the acts which caused death intending thereby to do really serious injury to him. The appellant's participation in the enterprise while possessed of the requisite intention (here, to inflict really serious injury) operates to fix him with liability for the acts of the other parties carried out in pursuance of it. On the principal case, the appellant's liability is direct and, as his argument acknowledged, his amenability to prosecution for murder is unaffected by the Director of Public Prosecutions' ('the Director') acceptance of pleas to lesser offences from all of the other parties to the joint criminal enterprise.""
(References omitted).

331It is important to bear in mind that liability for participation in a joint criminal enterprise does not depend on the person who committed the actual act giving rise to the offence being convicted. So much was made clear by McHugh J in Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316 (Osland). His Honour emphasised at [72]-[76] that what was attributed to the participants in the joint criminal enterprise was the actus rea of the person who actually committed the act in question.

332Osland was a case where the verdict of the jury convicting the accused of murder arising out of a joint criminal enterprise to murder the deceased was said to be inconsistent with the acquittal of the person said to be the co-participant in the enterprise. In his judgment in Osland, which was expressly approved by the High Court in Huynh v R [2013] HCA 6; (2013) 87 ALJR 434 at [37], McHugh J made the following comments:

""[79] The principle that those who act in concert and are present at the scene are responsible for the acts of the actual perpetrator operates to make a person guilty of the principal crime, even though the actual perpetrator is acquitted completely. Thus, the person who did the act may be legally insane. Yet as long as that person had sufficient mental capacity to enter into the arrangement or common understanding, the other participant present at the scene will be guilty of committing the principal crime if he or she has the relevant mens rea. In Matusevich v The Queen, this Court decided that, when two persons are said to be acting in concert, the fact that the actual perpetrator is legally insane does not necessarily mean that the conviction of the other, who was present at the scene, should be quashed. If the actual perpetrator has sufficient capacity to enter into the agreement or understanding, the person present at the scene who was acting in concert may be convicted of the offence.

...

[93] Where the parties are acting as the result of an arrangement or understanding, there is nothing contrary to the objects of the criminal law in making the parties liable for each other's acts and the case for doing so is even stronger when they are at the scene together. If any of those acting in concert but not being the actual perpetrator has the relevant mens rea, it does not seem wrong in principle or as a matter of policy to hold that person liable as a principal in the first degree. Once the parties have agreed to do the acts which constitute the actus reus of the offence and are present acting in concert when the acts are committed, the criminal liability of each should depend upon the existence or non-existence of mens rea or upon their having a lawful justification for the acts, not upon the criminal liability of the actual perpetrator. So even if the actual perpetrator of the acts is acquitted, there is no reason in principle why others acting in concert cannot be convicted of the principal offence. They are responsible for the acts (because they have agreed to them being done) and they have the mens rea which is necessary to complete the commission of the crime.""
(References omitted).

333Thus it is clear the fact that the other co-accused were not convicted at the trial does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that the verdict against the appellant was unreasonable. What must be considered, consistent with what was said in MacKenzie, is whether or not on the particular facts of the case the verdicts can logically and reasonably stand together, or whether no reasonable jury who had applied their minds properly to the facts could have arrived at the conclusion they reached. 

334The Crown's opening address to the jury was that each of the six CMC members on trial were parties to the enterprise. The Crown stated:

""That each of them had agreed to assault one or more of the Hells Angels in some way, just to assault them, and that each of them... contemplated the possibility that someone else in the agreement might intentionally inflict really serious physical injury on one or more of the Hells Angels as part of that agreement, then each of them would still be guilty of murder"". 

The Crown emphasised that the agreement was limited to one between the six accused. 

335The Crown put the case in the same way in its closing address: 

""The Crown has to prove against each accused charged with murder that there was an understanding or an arrangement in existence at the time of the acts that caused Anthony Zervas' death, but you could be satisfied that it was formed spontaneously at any time up until those fatal acts. But what we say is you would be satisfied at least that that agreement was formed from the time of the threats that were issued as the 10 Comanchero left gate 5.""

336In his summing-up the learned trial judge directed the jury in the following terms:

""So, what is it that the Crown must prove to prove that an accused is guilty of murder on the joint criminal enterprise basis? The Crown must prove that at the time that the acts which caused the death of the deceased were committed, there are five things:

1. There was in existence a joint criminal enterprise or agreement, which had as its object the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon one or more members of the Hells Angels group.

2. The accused, whose case you are considering, was a party to that agreement.

3. One or more parties to that agreement inflicted grievous bodily harm upon a member of the Hells Angels group, namely Anthony Zervas:

(i) by a deliberate act;

(ii) with the intention at least to cause grievous bodily harm; and

(iii) unlawfully, that is, not in self-defence.

4. Anthony Zervas died as a result.

And

5. The accused, whose case you are considering, was present, participating in the execution of the agreement at least by being ready and willing to provide assistance if required.""

There was no suggestion on the appeal that these directions were erroneous.

337As I indicated earlier, none of the alleged co-participants in the joint enterprise were convicted of murder or manslaughter, although there was a hung jury on manslaughter in respect of Mr Menzies and Mr Abounader. 

338The question which then arises is whether there is a way of reconciling these verdicts.

339The first and most obvious way is that the jury did not convict the appellant on the basis of joint criminal enterprise at all but rather on the basis that the appellant inflicted the fatal blow. As I have indicated I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is in fact what occurred.

340The second and also relatively obvious way of reconciling the verdicts is that the jury was satisfied that the appellant participated in a joint criminal enterprise with one or more of his fellow CMC members, but could not be satisfied which of those CMC members were parties to the joint criminal enterprise either at the time the understanding was reached or at the time the fatal blow occurred. This would readily explain the acquittal of all the other CMC members. However, the difficulty with this conclusion is that to convict the appellant it would be necessary for the jury to conclude that at least one of the five persons said to be co-participants in the joint criminal enterprise with the appellant was one of his co-accused and that co-accused inflicted the fatal blow. The jury's verdicts in respect of the alleged co-participants meant it could not be concluded that one of them inflicted that blow as distinct from the other CMC members who were not on trial. Absent satisfaction that one of the co-accused inflicted the fatal blow it could not be said that the appellant was guilty of murder resulting from a joint criminal enterprise. The same reasoning applies to the argument in respect of extended joint criminal enterprise.

341In his remarks on sentence the trial judge attempted to reconcile the verdicts in the manner I have set out in par [290] above. His Honour was of course in a position where he had to give effect to the verdicts of the jury. However, with the greatest respect, there are a number of difficulties with his analysis, at least so far as liability on the basis of participation in a joint criminal enterprise is concerned. 

342First, as his Honour correctly pointed out, all he could be satisfied of was that the man who inflicted the fatal blow was one of the CMC members. However, he was unable to identify who out of the six accused it was having regard to the verdicts of the jury. In these circumstances it could not be concluded that the person who struck the fatal blow was one of the participants to the agreement.

343I am conscious of the fact that there was evidence which may have suggested that the person who inflicted the blow was Mr Menzies. However, as the trial judge said in his remarks, the most that could be concluded was that having regard to the verdict of the jury the person who inflicted the fatal wounds was tall and had dark clothing on his upper body. That description is at least consistent with the descriptions of Mr Menzies, Mr Eken, Mr Potrus, Mr Aouli, Mr Costa and Mr Pirini. Mr Aouli, Mr Costa, and Mr Pirini were not said to be participants in the joint criminal enterprise. 

344Had Mr Menzies been convicted of manslaughter it would have been possible to reconcile the verdicts on the basis that the jury had concluded that there was an agreement between at least Mr Menzies and the appellant to assault the HA members and that they contemplated the possibility that the result might be to inflict serious injury on one of them. In these circumstances the jury may have considered, for example, that Mr Menzies was only liable to be convicted of manslaughter, having used excessive self-defence in the fight, but the appellant was guilty of murder, he having the requisite mens rea. 

345There are of course difficulties with this analysis. First, the action of a person bringing down a bollard on another person lying on the ground seems difficult to characterise as an act of self-defence. Further, on the facts, the appellant would have had a stronger argument of self-defence than Mr Menzies, given the appellant was (at least initially) attacked by the deceased. More importantly however, Mr Menzies was not convicted of manslaughter. In these circumstances it does not seem to me to be possible to reconcile the verdicts in this fashion. 

346A second difficulty with trial judge's analysis at par [290] above is that the conclusion does not seem to me to be based on either joint criminal enterprise or extended joint criminal enterprise. Rather, it is consistent with the appellant being liable as an accessory to the crime committed by one or other of the CMC members (not necessarily limited to those on trial with the appellant). Although this may well be a way of reconciling the verdicts of the jury, the difficulty is that the Crown case was not put on that basis either before the jury or in this Court. The only alternative relied on was a spontaneous agreement made between the appellant and the five other CMC members on trial who inflicted the fatal blow.

347I accept that an agreement constituting a joint criminal enterprise need not be formal and an understanding reached spontaneously between two persons to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased would be sufficient to constitute such an enterprise. Further, I accept the understanding or arrangement may be inferred from all the circumstances. However, there remain a number of difficulties with this approach. First, on the Crown case the spontaneous agreement had to be one between the appellant and one of his five co-accused. However, none of the five co-accused was convicted of any unlawful act of either murder or manslaughter. The same problem thus arises as arose in the case of an alleged joint criminal enterprise formed by an agreement or understanding at Gate 5.

348Further, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such a spontaneous agreement existed. The fight in which the deceased was killed was ongoing, commencing when the deceased attacked the appellant. As the appellant pointed out in his submissions, there was about 48 seconds in which such an agreement or understanding could be reached. The fact that there was ongoing fighting including the assault on the deceased does not satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that a separate agreement or understanding was reached spontaneously between the appellant and whoever it was who inflicted the fatal blow in that short time frame.

349In these circumstances it does not seem to me possible to reconcile the verdict convicting the appellant with a verdict of acquittal in respect of three of the co-accused and the failure to find Mr Menzies or Mr Abounader guilty of any unlawful act of either murder or manslaughter. In the circumstances the verdict was unreasonable and should be set aside. 

Disposition of the appeal

350It follows I am of the view the following orders should be made:

(1)Set aside the conviction of the appellant for the murder of Anthony Zervas.

(2)In lieu thereof direct the entry of a verdict of acquittal.

351The effect of the judgment of the other members of the Court is that Price J and I would allow the appeal but differ as to the consequent order to be made. McCallum J would dismiss the appeal. There is thus no majority in favour of any form of orders disposing of the proceedings.

Does s 21A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act apply in these circumstances?

352Section 21A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act relevantly provides that if the judges present on an appeal are equally divided in opinion, the decision of the court is to be in accordance with the opinion of the Chief Justice or other judge presiding.

353Some support for the conclusion that s 21A is capable of operation in the present circumstances perhaps may be derived from the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Evans v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Another [2003] FCAFC 276; (2003) 135 FCR 306 (Evans). That case involved the determination of two separate questions. The first question asked whether a notice published by the Minister in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette was a valid exercise of power under the then s 503A(9) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). The second question asked that if the first question was answered in the negative, were the invalid parts severable? The primary judge answered the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative. The appellant appealed from the primary judge's answer to the second question, whilst the respondents cross-appealed against the answer to question one.

354Gray J, the presiding judge, concluded that the appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed, with the result being that both questions should be answered in the negative: Evans at [31]. Kenny J concluded that both the appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed: Evans at [70]. Downes J would have allowed the cross-appeal, as a consequence of which, in his view, the second question did not arise. He also considered that in the circumstances it was not appropriate for him to deal with the second question: Evans at [112]-[113].

355Section 16(a) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provides that in the case of an appeal from a judgment of the Court constituted by a single judge, if the judges constituting a Full Court are equally divided in opinion, the judgment appealed from shall be affirmed. Gray J held that as there was a majority view that the cross-appeal should be dismissed, such an order should be made. So far as the appeal was concerned, his Honour held that there was no majority view on the answer to the second question. However, his Honour concluded that so far as views were expressed the Court was equally divided and in those circumstances the decision of the primary judge on that question should be affirmed: Evans at [33]; Kenny J at [70] and Downes J at [112] agreeing. 

356In Skulander v Willoughby City Council [2007] NSWCA 116; (2007) 73 NSWLR 44 (Skulander) the three members of the Court disagreed as to the outcome of an appeal from a verdict for the defendant in a claim for negligence. Mason P would have dismissed the appeal. Beazley JA and Basten JA would have upheld it, but made different allowances in their assessment of the deduction from the award of damages for contributory negligence.

357Section 45(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) is in the same terms as s 21A of the Criminal Appeal Act. Mason P expressed the opinion that if in the circumstances the Court was equally divided, the application of s 45(2) would produce startling and troubling consequences: Skulander at [49]-[51]. The same may be said in the present case where I am the only judge who has concluded that the verdict was unreasonable. Although Mason P did not state that the decision in Evans was wrongly decided, the Court did not apply s 45(2) of the Supreme Court Act.

358The approach in Evans may have been appropriate in the particular circumstances of that case where only two judges dealt with a separate order in respect of which an appeal had been brought. However, in my opinion that approach cannot be extended to circumstances where three judges hold different views as to the outcome of the appeal. Such an approach is inconsistent with the plain words of s 21A of the Criminal Appeal Act, the operation of which is predicated on the members of the Court being equally divided. In the present case they are not.

359The view which I have expressed is consistent with authority.

360In The Perpetual Trustee Company (Ltd) v Tindal and Others [1940] HCA 14; (1940) 63 CLR 232 (Tindal) there was a diversity of opinion between six justices of the High Court as to the manner in which the proceeds of an insurance policy on the life of a deceased should be distributed. Three of the justices held that the policy should be distributed in a particular way, whilst the other three disagreed but each reached different conclusions as to the appropriate method of distribution. However, five of the six justices were of the opinion that the judgment of the court below was incorrect. At 250, Latham CJ expressed the view that where there was a majority in favour of allowing the appeal but no majority in favour of the terms of any particular order to be substituted, it was a matter of doubt whether the matter was governed by s 23(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Section 23(2) provided that in the case of an equal division of opinion in an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of a State, the decision of the court below should be affirmed. The problem was resolved in that case by Starke J withdrawing his judgment. It should be noted that Starke J was not the junior judge.

361The view that s 21A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act has no application in the circumstances of the present case is also supported by authority in this State. Arbest Pty Ltd v State Bank of New South Wales Ltd [1996] NSWCA 19; (1996) ATPR 41-481 (Arbest) concerned an appeal from the dismissal of a claim for relief under the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and the Contracts Review Act 1980 (NSW). Kirby P and Priestley JA each considered that the appeal should be allowed but differed as to the extent of the relief which should be granted. Powell JA would have dismissed the appeal. Kirby P withdrew his orders in favour of those proposed by Priestley JA. His Honour stated that it was the opinion of Priestley JA which represented ""the highest measure of agreement"" between the members of the Court: Arbest at 41,997. A special leave application was refused, the High Court expressing the view that s 45(2) of the Supreme Court Act had no application in the circumstances of the case.

362In R v Robinson [2000] NSWCCA 59; (2000) 111 A Crim R 388 (Robinson), a situation similar to the present occurred. The accused was charged with various counts of sexual offences. He was convicted on three counts but acquitted on one other. Fitzgerald JA concluded that the verdicts of guilty were unsafe and unsatisfactory and would have entered a verdict of acquittal. Barr J would have ordered a retrial whilst Smart AJ would have dismissed the appeal. However, to achieve a result Smart AJ withdrew his judgment and concurred in the orders proposed by Barr J. His Honour did not state any reasons for doing so.

363Special leave to the High Court was sought on grounds including that the Court was equally divided and in those circumstances the orders proposed by Fitzgerald JA should have been made by virtue of the operation of s 21A of the Criminal Appeal Act. Special leave was refused.

364Although neither the remarks made in argument on a special leave application nor the reasons for refusal of leave are binding on this Court, I would respectfully adopt the following remarks of Gleeson CJ in argument:

""... Now, we have a different system, but surely what a statutory provision like this operates on is the ultimate decision rather than the process of reasoning leading up to that decision. I would have thought that in the present case if Justice Smart had not taken the course that he took and had simply gone ahead to say, 'I propose that the appeals should be dismissed' then there would have been nothing for this section to operate on because the judges were not equally divided in opinion.""
See Robinson v The Queen S106/2000 [2000] HCATrans 716 (24 November 2000). 


365These remarks accord with my view as to the proper construction of s 21A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act. It follows that it has no application in the present case.

Other options

(a) Expanding or reconstituting the Court

366In the United Kingdom s 55(5) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (UK) provides that where an appeal has been heard by a court consisting of an even number of judges and the members of the court are equally divided, the case shall be re-argued before and determined by an uneven number of judges. By convention, a similar approach was adopted in the case of division between an uneven number of judges: see R v Shama [1990] 2 All ER 602; [1990] 1 WLR 661 (Shama) at 663. However the validity of that approach does not appear to be universally accepted. In Shama the judges who first heard the appeal were divided as to the outcome. The case was referred to a different bench of three, but following an objection to its jurisdiction it was referred back to the original bench which ultimately resolved the appeal.

367Section 3(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that the Supreme Court shall for the purpose of the Act be the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the court shall be constituted by such three or more judges of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct.

368It has been the practice for the Chief Justice to nominate three (or five) judges to constitute the Court of Criminal Appeal for any particular case or on a particular sitting day (usually done by appointing judges to sit on a particular sitting day with the power to complete cases listed on that day if not finished on the day in question). This was the procedure adopted in the present case. It is questionable whether the power conferred by s 3(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act confers a power to vary or enlarge a bench where the bench has already heard argument on the appeal.

369It is not necessary to reach a final conclusion on this issue, as even if the power were available I would not be disposed to exercise it. This is for two reasons. First, it would not necessarily produce an outcome. Second, and more fundamentally, it would be unjust to expose the appellant to a risk of dismissal of his appeal in circumstances where a majority of the Court as presently constituted would at least quash the conviction.

(b) Consideration by me of Ground 3

370The issue which divided Price and McCallum JJ was whether the appellant should succeed on Ground 3 (provocation). In Skulander at [71]-[76], Mason P reluctantly adopted the course of considering the issue of contributory negligence on the assumption that, contrary to his view, negligence had been established.

371Although that course of action may well have been appropriate where the outstanding issue was the extent of the appellant's contributory negligence, I do not think it is appropriate in this case. It would involve me considering the issue on the basis that the jury was entitled to be satisfied of the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt subject to the direction as to provocation. This is a conclusion which I have rejected. Further, if I came to the view that McCallum J was correct in relation to Ground 3, presumably the result would be that I should concur in the dismissal of the appeal notwithstanding the view I have expressed. In my opinion this approach would seem to cause significant injustice to the appellant.

(c) Allowing the jury verdict to stand

372This was the approach adopted in earlier times in the United Kingdom when a bench was equally divided: The Queen v Ashwell (1885) 16 QBD 190. It has not been the approach adopted in this State and in any event the Court is not equally divided. In my opinion it would be quite inappropriate in circumstances where at least the majority would quash the conviction.

(d) The junior judge deferring to the senior judge

373There was said to be a convention that in cases of this nature the junior judge should withdraw the orders he or she proposes and agree with those of the senior judge: see, for example, O'Brien v Tanning Research Laboratories Inc (1988) 14 NSWLR 601 at 641. The existence of such a convention was described by Kirby P in CES and Another v Superclinics (Australia) Pty Ltd and Others (1995) 38 NSWLR 47 (Superclinics) at 79 as a procedure not to be adopted in ""these more enlightened times"": cf. Skulander supra at [74]. However the approach even in those so-called less enlightened times was by no means universal. I have already referred to Tindal where Starke J who was not the junior judge withdrew his judgment to enable a majority decision to be reached. Further, it does not generally seem to be the approach which has been adopted in this Court or in the Court of Appeal since the decision of the Court of Appeal in Woolworths Ltd v Kelly (1991) 22 NSWLR 189 (Woolworths) (see the cases cited in (e) below. Cf. Government Insurance Office of New South Wales v Rosniak (1992) 27 NSWLR 665 at 700 and Hayes v Marquis [2008] NSWCA 10 at [203]).

374McCallum J has not indicated a willingness to withdraw her judgment and in my opinion it would be inappropriate for her to do so. The result would be that the jury verdict would be held to be unreasonable notwithstanding her view and the view of Price J. To elevate my dissent into a majority decision in these circumstances does not seem to me to be an appropriate result.

(e) A result reflecting the ""highest common denominator""

375In Woolworths at 200, Kirby P stated that the appropriate course was an attempt to find within the reasons and orders proposed by the judges the highest common denominator of rational agreement. That case involved the question of whether the appellant was liable to pay an annual pension to the respondent and whether the respondent held those payments which had been made as constructive trustee for the appellant. The trial judge had found for the respondent on both issues and his findings were the subject of the appeal. Kirby P would have allowed the appeal on both issues, Samuels JA on the first only whilst Mahoney JA would have dismissed the appeal.

376At 200, Kirby P described the traditional approach of the junior judge deferring to the senior judge as owing more to history than logic. He stated that the appropriate approach was to find what he described as the highest common denominator of rational agreement (perhaps more accurately the highest common factor, or as Brooking J described it in Pippos v Craig (1993) 1 VR 603 at 611 (Pippos), the least unsatisfactory outcome). Applying this approach Kirby P concurred in the orders proposed by Samuels JA. 

377Kirby P applied this approach on a number of subsequent occasions: Superclinics at 78-79, New South Wales Medical Defence Union Ltd v Crawford (No 3) (Court of Appeal (NSW), 23 September 1994, unrep), Westpac Banking Corporation v Tomassian (1993) 32 NSWLR 207 at 213-214, Lexington Constructions Pty Ltd v Coyne (Court of Appeal (NSW), 24 December 1992, unrep), Tsivinsky v Tsivinsky (Court of Appeal (NSW), 5 December 1991, unrep) and Attorney General for New South Wales v Barr (Court of Appeal (NSW), 11 October 1991, unrep). In Skulander at [74], Mason P accepted that the approach was rational but expressed concern that Kirby P had appeared to adopt it of his own volition and without the concurrence of his colleagues. In Pippos, Brooking J consulted with his judicial colleagues before adopting a similar course.

378A similar approach has been adopted in a number of cases in this Court: Robinson and R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 112; (2005) 153 A Crim R 257 at [38].

379In the present case, after consultation with Price and McCallum JJ and with their corroboration, I have concluded that notwithstanding the view I have expressed, it is appropriate that I concur in the orders proposed by Price J. This gives effect to the majority view that the appeal should be allowed whilst preserving the opinion of each of Price and McCallum JJ that the verdict was not unreasonable. It will of course be a matter for the Crown after consideration of the reasons of each member of the Court and such other matters as it considers appropriate to determine whether or not to retry the appellant.

380For these reasons I agree that the orders proposed by Price J should be made.

381PRICE J: I have had the privilege of reading the judgment of Bathurst CJ. His Honour's exposition of the evidence enables me to go to the appellant's contention that the jury's verdict of murder is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence (Ground 1).

382The Chief Justice has detailed at [307] - [315] above, the principles on which this Court is obliged to deal with this ground of appeal and the question of an inconsistent verdict (Ground 2). In respect of the first ground, I would add what was said by Hayne J (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing) in Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113]: 

""It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant's guilt on this first count. But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. In the present case, the critical question for the jury was what assessment they made of the whole of the evidence... That evidence did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.""

383The Chief Justice has carefully analysed at [316] - [326] above, the inconsistencies in the evidence of the witnesses upon whom the Crown relied to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was directly responsible for the death of Anthony Zervas. The question is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant deliberately struck the deceased's head with a bollard which substantially contributed to his death with an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm and the act was not done in self-defence. 

384During oral submissions in this Court, senior counsel for the Crown argued that it was open on the combined evidence of SP and Mr Ireland for the jury to find that the appellant actually inflicted the fatal blow. I understood from this submission that the Crown contended that it was open to the jury to find that there had been a deliberate act by the appellant which caused or substantially contributed to the death. It was the appellant's case that the evidence viewed as a whole, simply did not support the conclusion that he was actively involved in the killing of the deceased. The appellant criticised Mr Ireland's evidence as being unreliable and inconsistent with the independent evidence of the timing of the incident as established through the CCTV footage and the Deng video. 

385The appellant argued that given the jury verdicts with regard to Mr Menzies, it was clear that the evidence of SP and AL was not accepted. 

386The appellant further submitted that SP's evidence was not supported by the Deng video. As the Chief Justice points out at [325] above, the video does not assist in establishing that the appellant inflicted a fatal blow by using the bollard in an up and down motion. The footage does depict the appellant moving away from the location of the violence inflicted upon the deceased. However, it was not suggested that the video recorded all that occurred. The trial Judge directed the jury that ""the Deng footage was recorded around about the time of the end of the incident in the departure hall"". The footage runs for 16.16 seconds. In my opinion the Deng video neither strengthens nor weakens the Crown case. 

387It was SP's evidence that he saw the appellant strike the deceased with a bollard once. He said that the appellant used a similar motion to Mr Menzies, picking the bollard up and striking it down. SP had been criminally concerned in the events at the airport and had received a 30 per cent reduction in sentence for his assistance to authorities. The trial Judge provided the jury with directions and warnings about SP's evidence, which included the obligation to approach that evidence with great caution, as it may be unreliable. 

388Although it was not necessary for the trial Judge to direct the jury that SP's evidence must be corroborated, it is the Crown's contention that his evidence found independent support particularly in the evidence of Mr Ireland, who saw the man in white trousers and white shirt pick up a metal stand and appear to swing it with a putting action two to three times. 

389Although Mr Ireland did not describe the appellant using the bollard in an up and down motion, it was not his evidence that he saw all that occurred. Mr Ireland described his concerns for his wife, looking at her and then looking back. He told the jury his head ""was virtually on a swivel"". It was open to the jury to reject the criticism of Mr Ireland's testimony and to consider that it supported SP's evidence. 

390To a lesser extent, SP's evidence finds support in the testimony of Ms Xanthe Gray who saw the man wearing light coloured pants grab a nearby barrier pole and stamp it over the head of the man on the ground and Ms Karen-Ann Whyte's selection of the appellant's picture as the person who ""bashed a man to death with an instrument"". She also selected another photograph of a man who had a similar build to the one she saw hitting the man on the ground with the bollard, but was more reasonably confident that between the two it was photograph number 4 (the appellant) who was familiar to her. Whilst there were inconsistencies in the evidence of these witnesses, it was open to the jury to take their evidence into account in support of the case against the accused. 

391SP's evidence is consistent with Dr Duflou's finding that the cause of death was the combined effect of blunt force head injury and stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. The jury plainly rejected the appellant's account of events at the airport. 

392It seems to me that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant struck the deceased on the head with the bollard but not to be satisfied to the criminal standard that Mr Menzies did. Although AL testified that he saw Mr Menzies hit the man on the floor twice, AL was criminally concerned in the events at the airport and the jury was instructed to also approach his evidence with great caution. There was no independent evidence that supported AL. 

393Unlike his evidence concerning the appellant, SP's evidence of Mr Menzies was not supported by Mr Ireland or any other independent witness nor was his photograph selected as being a person who struck the deceased. The same observation might be made about SP's evidence of Mr Abounader. I conclude that the verdicts are not inconsistent and do not demonstrate that SP's evidence of the appellant was not accepted by the jury.

394Having made my own independent assessment of the evidence, it is my view that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant deliberately struck the deceased's head with a bollard which substantially contributed to his death with an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm and the act was not done in self-defence. In the result, I do not agree with the Chief Justice that the jury should necessarily have entertained a reasonable doubt that the appellant struck the deceased with a bollard and was directly responsible for the death. 

395I have also had the advantage of reading the judgment of McCallum J. Her Honour at [488] - [518], deals with the issues raised in the appeal as to the guilt of the appellant on the basis of joint criminal enterprise, or extended joint criminal enterprise if the conclusion as to guilt on the basis of direct responsibility entails error. I respectfully adopt the reasons and conclusions of her Honour. 

396I would reject Grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal. 

Ground 3: The trial judge erred in failing to leave provocation to the jury.

397During the course of the trial (5 September 2011), senior counsel then appearing for the appellant requested that the jury be directed in relation to the alternative verdict of manslaughter based on provocation. It was not in dispute that in the departure lounge, the first physical act of violence was when the deceased had tried to stab the appellant in the head. Senior counsel put to the trial Judge that this was a ""highly provocative act"" which had occurred before the attack alleged by the Crown and should the jury reject the appellant's account and find that the appellant was involved in the fatal attack on the deceased, both provocation and excessive self-defence arose. 

398The Crown submitted that if provocation was raised on the evidence, there was no objection to the direction being given. His Honour determined on 20 September 2011 that provocation should not be left to the jury. His Honour said:

""I don't propose to leave provocation to the jury. I have come to the view that whatever might be relevant in terms of those types of defences, they are relevant to self-defence and there is no work left for provocation upon that material."" 

Argument 

399The appellant submitted that this ruling was erroneous, as provocation as a basis for a verdict of manslaughter was available on the evidence relied on in the Crown case and should have been left to the jury. The appellant contended that it was not correct to say that provocation was consumed by the directions on excessive self-defence. The appellant referred to the observation of Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Masciantonio v R (1995) 183 CLR 58 at 68 that: 

""Whilst anger is primarily a feature of provocation and fear a feature of self-defence, loss of self-control may be due to a mixture of fear and anger."" 

400The appellant noted that s 421 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (excessive self-defence) makes it essential that the conduct is not a reasonable response as he/she perceives them, ""but the person believes the conduct is necessary: (c) to defend himself ... or another person..."" The appellant pointed out there is no such requirement for belief that the conduct is necessary in defence of self or another, under s 23 Crimes Act (provocation). Rather, the focus of provocation, the appellant submitted, was on a loss of self-control induced by conduct of the deceased, which could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the appellant to have lost self-control such as to form the relevant intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. The appellant argued that excessive self-defence does not subsume provocation, rather there is a real and substantial difference between the two, and there is a duty on the trial Judge to give directions on provocation even where an issue to be negatived is self-defence. 

401The Crown submitted that the trial Judge did not err by failing to give directions on provocation, having regard to the evidence in the trial. The Crown referred to the sole reliance on self-defence in the appellant's case, the absence of ""even the faintest suggestion"" in the evidence that the appellant had or might have been acting in a manner that could successfully enliven the defence of provocation and the absence of any detailed application at trial by the appellant in support of the directions being given. 

402The Crown argued that his Honour's remarks were made having regard to the complexity of the trial and the task that lay before him and the jury. The Crown suggested that the trial Judge was referring to the practical rather than the theoretical relevance of provocation to the issues litigated, and the evidence led before the jury by the Crown and in the respective defence cases. 

403The Crown contended that if this Court was of the view that directions on provocation ought to have been given, the Court would nevertheless be satisfied that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice. The Crown argued: 

(a) the evidence demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt that the pre-emptive strike by the deceased was undertaken in circumstances where a violent confrontation between the gangs was inevitable because of the appellant's conduct (during the fight at Gate 5 and by approaching and arguing with the deceased's brother in the Departure Hall) against a background of inter-club hostility; and/or,

(b) there is no reasonable possibility that the appellant might have lost self-control as a consequence of the conduct of the deceased towards or affecting the appellant that he participated in the fatal attack on the deceased intending that he be killed or suffer really serious bodily harm; and/or,

(c) there is no reasonable possibility that the conduct of the deceased towards or affecting the appellant could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the appellant to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intention that the deceased be killed or suffer grievous bodily harm. 

Consideration 

404The first question for the trial Judge was whether there was evidence which was capable of constituting provocation. The test has been summarised as being whether, ""on the version of the events most favourable to the accused which is suggested by the material in the evidence, a jury acting reasonably might fail to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killing was unprovoked in the relevant sense"": Stingel v R (1990) 171 CLR 312 at 334.

405The appellant did not give evidence that he was provoked or lost self-control but that does not exclude the partial defence of provocation: Van Den Hoek v R (1986) 161 CLR 158 at 161. On the Crown case, the appellant was stabbed in the departure hall, behind the check in counters by the deceased. The deceased used scissors to strike at the temple area of the appellant's head. It was SP's evidence that the deceased came from behind and pulled scissors from behind his back, and took a strike at the side of the appellant's head. SP thought the appellant put his hand up and it [the scissors] connected on the side of his head. In cross-examination, he agreed that whilst the appellant and Peter Zervas were face to face, the appellant was attacked by the deceased from behind.

2763964,R v Lago [2014] NSWSC 660,"ex tempore Judgment (REVISED) 
APPLICATION FOR BAIL
VIDEO LINK TO SOUTH COAST CORRECTIONAL CENTRE

1HIS HONOUR: Brett Bartholomew Lago applies for bail in respect of a number of extremely serious charges. He is alleged to have committed a series of offences including an offence under s 112(3) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in March 2014. In addition to that charge, which is far and away the most serious, he is also charged with a number of offences under the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). The specially aggravated break and enter offence is a particularly serious allegation. There is a five page statement of facts prepared by investigating police and its contents describe a very serious example of what is sometimes called a ""home invasion"" type offence.

2Ms Rigg, of the Public Defenders, who appears for the applicant has indicated that those facts are subject to significant dispute. The offence is alleged to have occurred on 11 March 2014 and the applicant has been in custody since 12 March 2014. His case is next for mention at the Wollongong Local Court on 4 June 2014. It is accepted by the Crown, who was ably represented in this Court by Ms Sharma, that he is likely to ""be on remand for some time before facing trial"".

3The application falls to be determined pursuant to the provisions of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) (""the Act""), which came into operation on Tuesday of this week. The evidence and submissions were taken yesterday, that is Wednesday, and I adjourned overnight to consider my decision. The application is a complex and difficult one. The Act has made significant changes to the approach that bail authorities, and particularly courts, must take when considering applications for release on bail. In accordance with the terms of the Act, bail applications fall into two categories: release applications (s 49) and detention applications (s 50). This, plainly enough, is a release application, bail having been refused by the Local Court.

4The major change affected by the Act is to remove the complicated series of presumptions which were provided for in the Act 1978 (NSW). The Act focuses on an assessment of risk - what are called ""unacceptable risks"" - and on the protection of the community, the Court's process and alleged victims and witnesses. In this respect the central provision is contained in s 17 of the Act. That provision is in the following terms:
""Requirement to consider unacceptable risk 
(1) A bail authority must, before making a bail decision, consider whether there are any unacceptable risks. 

(2) For the purposes of this Act, an 
""unacceptable risk"" is an unacceptable risk that an accused person, if released from custody, will: 
(a) fail to appear at any proceedings for the offence, or 
(b) commit a serious offence, or 
(c) endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or 
(d) interfere with witnesses or evidence. 

(3) A bail authority is to consider the following matters, and only the following matters, in deciding whether there is an unacceptable risk: 

(a) the accused person's background, including criminal history, circumstances and community ties, 
(b) the nature and seriousness of the offence, 
(c) the strength of the prosecution case, 
(d) whether the accused person has a history of violence, 
(e) whether the accused person has previously committed a serious offence while on bail, 
(f) whether the accused person has a pattern of non-compliance with bail acknowledgments, bail conditions, apprehended violence orders, parole orders or good behaviour bonds, 
(g) the length of time the accused person is likely to spend in custody if bail is refused, 
(h) the likelihood of a custodial sentence being imposed if the accused person is convicted of the offence, 
(i) if the accused person has been convicted of the offence and proceedings on an appeal against conviction or sentence are pending before a court, whether the appeal has a reasonably arguable prospect of success, 
(j) any special vulnerability or needs the accused person has including because of youth, being an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, or having a cognitive or mental health impairment, 
(k) the need for the accused person to be free to prepare for their appearance in court or to obtain legal advice, 
(l) the need for the accused person to be free for any other lawful reason.

(4) The following matters (to the extent relevant) are to be considered in deciding whether an offence is a serious offence (or the seriousness of an offence), but do not limit the matters that can be considered: 

(a) whether the offence is of a sexual or violent nature or involves the possession or use of an offensive weapon or instrument within the meaning of the Crimes Act 1900 , 
(b) the likely effect of the offence on any victim and on the community generally, 
(c) the number of offences likely to be committed or for which the person has been granted bail or released on parole. 

(5) If the person is not in custody, the question of whether there are any unacceptable risks is to be decided as if the person were in custody and could be released as a result of the bail decision."" 

5It will be seen that the term ""unacceptable risk"" is not further defined but that the assessment of whether there is such an unacceptable risk is to be considered by reference to an exhaustive list of factors contained in s 17(3). That section says that those are the only factors to be taken into account in determining the question of whether or not there is an unacceptable risk. The unacceptable risk is directed to the four matters mentioned in s 17(2). Subsection (4) is also important because it provides some of the matters to be considered in determining whether an offence is ""a serious offence"" for the purpose of s 17(2)(b). The Act, as I see it, does not cast an onus on either party to determine whether there is or is not an unacceptable risk.

6In helpful written submissions, Ms Rigg submits that there is an onus on the prosecution. I am not sure that that is so but equally I am not sure that it matters. The reason that I say that is because the matter ultimately is to be determined on the balance of probabilities (s32) and, when I come to it, it will be seen that the onus shifts to the prosecution at a more important stage of the reasoning process. If there is no unacceptable risk, bail can be dispensed with or the applicant is to be released without bail or on unconditional bail: s 18. Where there is an unacceptable risk the Court can either refuse bail or grant bail: s 19. 

7Section 20 is a critical provision and it provides that bail can only be refused where the Court is satisfied that any unacceptable risk ""cannot be sufficiently mitigated by the imposition of bail conditions"". It can be seen that this provision casts the onus on the party who is opposed to the grant of bail. Again, the standard is on the balance of probabilities.

8The concept of assessing risk of this kind has been considered in a number of cases in the context of legislation relating to bail in other states, in sentencing cases and also in applications for detention under various statutory schemes: see for example Williamson v DPP (2001) 1 Qd R 99; Dale v DPP [2009] VSCA 212; Woods v DPP [2014] VSC 1: Fardon v Attorney-General (Qld) (2004) 223 CLR 575 per Gleeson CJ at [22], McHugh J at [34], Gummow J at [60] and Callinan and Heydon JJ at [225]; M v M (1998) 166 CLR 69; Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [53]. 

9The cases on bail recognise that ""no grant of bail is risk free"": see Williamson (supra) at [22]; Dale (supra) at [58]. In the Application of Haidy [2004] VSC 247, a decision under the Victorian bail legislation, Redlich J said:
""Bail when granted is not risk free. Williamson v DPP (Qld).As the offender's liberty is at stake, a tenuous suspicion or fear of the worst possibility if the offender is released will not be sufficient. Dunstan v DPP; Williamson v DPP (Qld).""


10In Fardon v Attorney General (Qld) the High Court was concerned with the validity of Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 (Qld). Gleeson CJ said (at [22]):
""It was argued that the test, posed by s 13(2), of ""an unacceptable risk that the prisoner will commit a serious sexual offence"" is devoid of practical content. On the contrary, the standard of ""unacceptable risk"" was referred to by this Court in M v M in the context of the magnitude of a risk that will justify a court in denying a parent access to a child. The Court warned against ""striving for a greater degree of definition than the subject is capable of yielding"". The phrase is used in the Bail Act 1980 (Q), which provides that courts may deny bail where there is an unacceptable risk that an offender will fail to appear (s 16). It is not devoid of content, and its use does not warrant a conclusion that the decision-making process is a meaningless charade.""

11Callinan and Heydon JJ said (at [225]):
""The yardstick to which the Court is to have regard, of an unacceptable risk to the community, relevantly a risk established according to a high degree of probability, that the prisoner will commit another sexual offence if released, established on and by acceptable and cogent evidence, adduced according to the rules of evidence, is one which courts historically have had regard to in many areas of the law. The process of reaching a predictive conclusion about risk is not a novel one. The Family Court undertakes a similar process on a daily basis and this Court (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) said this in M v M of the appropriate approach by the Family Court to the evaluation of a risk to a child:

'Efforts to define with greater precision the magnitude of the risk which will justify a court in denying a parent access to a child have resulted in a variety of formulations. The degree of risk has been described as a 'risk of serious harm', 'an element of risk' or 'an appreciable risk', a 'real possibility', a 'real risk', and an 'unacceptable risk'. This imposing array indicates that the courts are striving for a greater degree of definition than the subject is capable of yielding. In devising these tests the courts have endeavoured, in their efforts to protect the child's paramount interests, to achieve a balance between the risk of detriment to the child from sexual abuse and the possibility of benefit to the child from parental access. To achieve a proper balance, the test is best expressed by saying that a court will not grant custody or access to a parent if that custody or access would expose the child to an unacceptable risk of sexual abuse.'""


12These comments provide some guidance as to the evaluative task involved in assessing whether there is an unacceptable risk although they must be considered in the context of other relevant provisions of the Act including:
The absence of the rules of evidence and the requirement that the task is to be undertaken by reference to 'any evidence or information that the bail authority considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances' (s. 31)
The standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities (s. 32)
The only matters that can be taken into account in making the assessment are those mentioned in s. 17(3).

13While the Act has changed in a significant way the focus of the Court from a series of complicated presumptions to an assessment of risk, certain fundamental concepts and protections that lie at the heart of our criminal justice system remain important. For example, the Act does no violence to the presumption of innocence or to the ultimate requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt before the State can punish one of its citizens. Further, the length of time that a person is required to remain in custody is specifically required to be taken into account in assessing whether there are or are not unacceptable risks: s. 17(3)(g). The following words of Sperling J in Cain (No 1) (2001) 121 A Crim R 365 at 367 continue to resonate when a bail authority is dealing with a release application where there is expected to be a lengthy delay:
""As to the interests of the applicant, he has a legitimate claim to be at liberty to go about a lawful life and to be with his family pending trial. He has been in custody for over a year. I am told by the Crown that the present charges might not come to trial for a further year. The prospect that a private citizen who has not been convicted of any offence might be imprisoned for as long as two years pending trial is, absent exceptional circumstances, not consistent with modern concepts of civil rights.""

14That brings me to the current application. While the applicant is presumed to be innocent, s 17 requires that the seriousness of the offence and the strength of the prosecution case are to be taken into account. In this case the allegation is extremely serious. It involves the entry into private premises by two men, one of whom was armed with a gun. The perpetrators made violent demands and threats to the occupants of the home. It must have been a terrifying experience. One of the perpetrators has, as I understand it, confessed his involvement in the crime.

15The Act makes it clear that the seriousness of the allegation is a matter that might give rise to an unacceptable risk even though that allegation has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is the very nature of the allegation that may cause the Court to conclude that there are unacceptable risks. Where the allegations include offences of extreme violence such as murder, the Court may conclude on that basis alone that there are unacceptable risks involved in the release of the alleged offender. However, the Act has abolished the requirement that an applicant charged with murder must establish ""exceptional circumstances"" justifying the grant of bail: s 9C Bail Act 1978. The proposition that the seriousness of the offence itself may give rise to unacceptable risk might also apply to offences such as the one that I am dealing with on this application. It will all depend on a consideration of the relevant factors referred to in s 17.

16In many cases, and this is one of them, it will be very difficult for the Court to assess the strength of the Crown case, particularly when the application is brought at an early stage. 

17Ms Rigg submits that even on the facts prepared by the police the Crown case is largely reliant on the word of a person who, on his own admission, was criminally concerned in the commission of this violent crime. That person was known to the occupants of the house and presumably nominated by them. There can be no doubt that a substantial attack will be mounted on the credibility of that witness in any future trial proceedings. This drove Ms Rigg to the submission that the Crown case is relatively weak.

18Ms Sharma, on the other hand, pointed to material in the fact sheet that suggests that there might be some corroboration or independent support for the evidence of the co-accused. That included the finding of a firearm in the possession of the applicant although this firearm was clearly not the gun used in the commission of this offence. Other items of potential relevance - including a firearm which has been identified by the victims as being involved in this offence - were found in a location with which the applicant has some connection and other items, as I say, were found there. However, as Ms Rigg points out, there were other people associated with those premises and that may have included the co-accused.

19Ms Sharma points to other evidence in the case and notes that the brief is yet to be compiled and served, there may be DNA evidence, and there may be fingerprint evidence. We simply do not know. I have taken those matters into account. 

20Doing the best that I can on the limited material now available, I am not persuaded that this is a strong Crown case. It is not necessarily a weak one, but it seems to me to be a case that could go either way at trial. Reliance on the evidence of a co-offender will result in firm warnings to the jury pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), and, as I have said, a substantial attack is likely to be made upon him. He has an interest in giving evidence against the applicant. I have also taken into account the criminal history of the applicant and I note that there is nothing on that record that would give rise by itself to the kind of concerns considered in s 17(2).

21In terms of the risk of non-appearance the applicant has a previous failure to appear in 2013 and by this alleged offence is said to have breached a bond or suspended sentence. Ms Sharma also points out that the prospect of a lengthy sentence for this offence may motivate the applicant to flee.

22As I have inferred above, it is apparent that the trial proceedings are most unlikely to occur this year. At this stage I am told that the brief is not yet complete, has not been served and it may include an attempt to obtain DNA evidence, which can take some time. My assessment is that the applicant will be required, if refused bail, to spend at least one year in custody enjoying, as it were, the presumption of innocence.

23Taking all of those matters into account, as well as other relevant matters set out in s 17(3), I have come to the conclusion that there is an unacceptable risk of the commission of a serious offence and to the safety of the witnesses and the victim. The major reason that I find those risks to exist is the serious nature of the alleged offending and the violence inherent in that offending, along with the applicant's possession of a gun, albeit a gun not associated with this alleged crime.

24However, Ms Rigg has presented me with a series of conditions that in my view mitigate those risks. Putting it correctly in terms of the onus in s 20 of the Act, I am not satisfied that the unacceptable risk that I have found cannot be mitigated by the conditions that Ms Rigg has proposed. 

25Those conditions will include conduct conditions pursuant to s 25 of the Act and enforcement conditions pursuant to s 30 of the Act. 

26The conduct conditions will include conditions as to where the applicant will live, as well as a curfew. They will require him not to associate with certain named individuals and he will have to report daily to police. They will require him not to have any contact whatsoever with any witnesses and not to go within a certain distance of relevant locations.

27The enforcement conditions will allow police to attend on his premises and require him to present himself to ensure that he is complying with the curfew. That enforcement condition will include a proviso that the police will only act on the condition where they ""believe on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do, having regard to the rights of other occupants of the premises to peace and privacy"".

28I do not impose any security requirements because I am prohibited from doing so under the terms of the legislation, unless I am of the view that he poses an unacceptable risk of non-appearance: s 26(5). I am not of the view that the applicant is an unacceptable risk of non-attendance. I record my opinion that this is something of a problem in the legislation.

2763975,R v Matthews [2014] NSWSC 608,"Judgment
INTRODUCTION
1On 3 February 2014 Steve Isac Matthews (""the offender"") pleaded guilty to the murder of Pia Navida (""the deceased"") on or about 1 February 1992. 

2The offender's joint trial with Rodney Paterson (""Paterson"") was due to commence on the day on which the plea was entered. Paterson subsequently went to trial but was acquitted by direction (see R v Paterson (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 162).

3Tendered on sentence was a Form 1 containing particulars of an offence of having sexual intercourse with the deceased without her consent, contrary to s. 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW. I have been asked to take that offence into account when sentencing the offender. 

4The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment (see Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 19A). Although a standard non-parole period of 20 years is now prescribed, that non-parole period has no application to the present case, the offence having been committed in 1992. 

THE FACTS
5A statement of agreed facts tendered by the Crown states the following: 

""1. At about midday on Saturday 1 February 1992 two bushwalkers, on a track in the Royal National Park near Bundeena, found some personal effects (deodorant, underwear and other items) and then the naked body of a woman. She was later identified as Pia Navida, aged 39 years. The cause of death was head injuries apparently inflicted with a large, blood stained rock found lying nearby. A car tyre track at the location near the deceased was observed and recorded. The tread pattern has been identified as consistent with a Dunlop Le Mans tyre with specifications J2 70 P195/70HR14. This type and brand of tyre is able to be commonly fitted on HQ Holdens.

2. Ms Navida had last been seen alive at about 2.00pm on Friday 31 January, 1992. Post-mortem examination suggested the time of death as the night of 31 January to 1 February 1992. Various swabs were taken from the deceased's body, including from the vagina, and rectum, together with such samples as fingernails.

3. Subsequent investigation showed that Ms Navida, a Filipina, had for the previous 13 months been living a nomadic lifestyle, earning a limited income from prostitution and using drugs. She and a boyfriend, Wayne Taylor, had frequented a cafe known as ""Greasy's"" near Central Railway Station in Surry Hills. Ms Navida from time to time would purchase drugs from a person or persons dealing from ""Greasy's"" cafe. Taylor had stayed at a nearby hostel, Foster House.
4. Forensic examination of exhibits in 1992 found semen on the vaginal and rectal swabs taken from the deceased's body; unidentified DNA was found on the vaginal and rectal swabs.

5. From the early investigation the following matters arise:-



The area that the body was found is a remote location concealed from the roadway;
The location was a very long distance from the location the deceased frequented at the time;
The deceased worked as a prostitute but had options available to her in her usual locations to engage in sex acts with clients and there was no need for a client or clients to take her to such a remote location for paid sex acts;
She did not have a car and had to be driven by someone to the location;
The body was completely naked;
Part of her clothing and some of her personal items were strewn around the location where her body was found and at some other nearby locations;
Sexual intercourse had occurred with the deceased which included vaginal and anal penetration;
On the track, and near where a tyre track ends, the deceased was struck on the head with a rock causing her death and her body was dragged into the nearby bushes. 

The combination of the matters enables the inference to be drawn that she was not at that remote location as a result of some agreement with a client. However it is consistent with the murder being sexually motivated which involved driving her to the location against her will and sexually assaulting her and then murdering her. The offender has a prior knowledge of the area.

6. Police continued to investigate. They interviewed Taylor and a number of other ""persons of interest"", but were able to eliminate all of these as suspects in Ms Navida's death. A Coronial Inquest returned an open finding on 6 December, 1994. The case remained unsolved.

7. Advances in DNA technology permitted further examination of exhibits in 2006 and thereafter. In 2006 such an examination of the rectal swabs identified thereon the DNA of the offender, Steve Matthews. Further testing in 2011 identified the DNA of Matthews on a vaginal swab, and that of co-accused Rodney Paterson on rectal swabs, a swab from the deceased's blouse in the area of the right breast, and on one of the deceased's fingernails. DNA of a male referred to as ""unknown male A"" was also identified in a rectal swab. Other items (fingernails, swabs, beads worn by the deceased) were examined and were now found to contain DNA from at least three individuals. It was found that the offender, Paterson and an ""unknown male A"" could not be excluded as the source of the male 
DNA recovered. It was only on receiving the DNA results in 2011 that police had forensic evidence of the involvement of a third male.

8. DNA recovered from the deceased's fingernails of three individual males is consistent with her struggling with those persons prior to her death.

9. Police established that the offender and Paterson had been together in Queensland some six weeks after the date of the murder, as they had come to the notice of Queensland police at that time.


15. At the relevant time the offender's habit was to purchase drugs from a person or persons dealing from ""Greasy's"" cafe.

16. Nicole Duffin was in a relationship with Matthews, with some breaks in the relationship, from around the late 1990's to early 2000's. Nicole Duffin, states that he once told her that he killed a person (she thinks he said a male) in a bush area by bashing that person with a large rock which he had wielded with both hands (that is, in the same manner in which the deceased appears to have been killed). Whilst telling this to Ms Duffin, he demonstrated to her what he did.

17. Ms Duffin recounts an occasion where at the request of Matthews she participated in group sexual activity with him and another male. She also states that Matthews initiated anal intercourse. It can be inferred that at the time of the murder the offender had those tendencies. Taking into account that shortly after the murder he was in Queensland with his co-accused, the evidence establishes that the presence of the DNA of both accused and a third male from examination of the deceased and her clothing is the result of the offender acting on his tendencies so that in the presence of the co-accused and with another male they had sexual intercourse with the deceased including anal penetration.

18. Ms Duffin states that during her relationship with Matthews they went on picnics to Bundeena at his suggestion. In an interview with police on 18 July 2011 Matthews admitted that as a school age boy he would camp and fish in the Royal National Park. Accordingly as at the date of the deceased's death the offender was familiar with the road way off which the body of the deceased was located.

19. The offender's hairstyle at March 1992 had changed from the style he had in late 1991 consistent with an attempt to change his appearance after the murder out of a consciousness of guilt.
20. During the interview with Matthews on 18 July 2011 police informed him that his DNA had been located on a rectal swab from the deceased. He offered no explanation. He said that he had no memory of either the deceased or Paterson whenshown their photographs. In the interview and other recorded conversations he maintains a lack of memory due to a traumatic brain injury sustained on 9 October 2005. Dr Reid, clinical neuropsychologist, is of the opinion that the loss of memorydescribed by Matthews is not consistent with what would be expected from such traumatic brain injury. 

21. Police enquiries of various intimates of the deceased indicate that she did not engage in anal sexual intercourse with her clients and that if confronted with physical threat she would fight back. This evidence is consistent with non-consensual sexual intercourse and that DNA under her fingernails from three males is as a result of her attempting to fight off her attackers.

22. Paterson was arrested and charged on 2 August 2011. Matthews was arrested and charged on the same day in Victoria and extradited to NSW.

23. The evidence establishes that on or about 1 February 1992 the offender together with two other males took the deceased in a motor vehicle, consistent with a HQ Holden, to bushland near Bundeena where they sexually assaulted her and thereafter each participated in the murder of Pia Navida which involved one or more of themstriking her with a large rock to her head causing her death. On the admission to Nicole Duffin the offender struck the deceased to the head with the rock located near the deceased.""

6Three matters should be noted regarding the agreed facts. Firstly, I have reproduced them in the form in which they were tendered, and absent any paragraphs numbered (10) to (14). Secondly, notwithstanding the contents of paragraphs (17) and (23), the Crown made it clear that there was no suggestion that the offending referred to in the Form 1 was said to have been committed in company. Thirdly, I raised with the Crown what appeared to me to be some inconsistency between paragraphs (16) and (23), in that paragraph (16) purported to attribute the act of killing the deceased solely to the offender, whilst paragraph (23) suggested the involvement and participation of others. The Crown subsequently clarified that it did not assert that any person other than the offender struck the deceased, nor did it assert that any other person was present when this occurred.

7A report from Professor Duflou, Forensic Pathologist, was tendered by the Crown. Professor Duflou conducted a post mortem examination of the deceased and found that she had sustained the following injuries: 

(i)a massive deformity of the head with crushing of the face and forehead;

(ii)a 34mm laceration immediately posterior and superior to the pinna of the left ear, with protrusion of fractured skull fragments and surrounding abrasion of the tissue;

(iii)a 12mm x 10mm laceration to the right of the forehead, 20mm to the right of the midline;

(iv)a 14mm laceration to the pinna of the left ear at its superior insertion;

(v)extensive abrasions of the forehead and surface of the head;

(vi)multiple linear abrasions over the superior aspect of the right shoulder, the posterior trunk and the posterior iliac crest, consistent with drag marks over a rough surface;

(vii)a 20mm laceration on the ulnar surface of the left thumb with associated degloving of the skin of the thumb but without any underlying fracture of the bones of the hands;

(viii)a 50mm x 30mm abrasion and contusion on the dorsum of the left hand, in the region of the first web space;

(ix)areas of abrasion on the dorsal surfaces of the fourth and fifth fingers of the left hand; and

(x)two areas of red bruising measuring 20mm x 15mm and 30mm x 20mm in the right antecubital fossa.

8Professor Duflou concluded that the head injuries sustained by the deceased were the direct cause of her death. 
 
THE OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENDING
9Counsel for the offender conceded that the nature of the deceased's injuries, and the terms of offender's admission to Ms Duffin, were consistent with a conclusion that the offender's actions were accompanied by an intention to kill the deceased, and I so find. 

10The Crown submitted that it would be open to find that the offender's attack on the deceased was sexually motivated, in the sense of being motivated by a desire to ensure that the deceased would not be in a position to attest to the fact that she had been sexually assaulted. Counsel for the offender submitted that the evidence was equally consistent with a conclusion that the offender was motivated by a form of what he described as ""self loathing"". There is necessarily some degree of speculation inherent in the submissions of each party in respect of the issue of motive. The evidence does not permit me to reach any definitive conclusion about what motivated the offender to act as he did.

11Further, whilst there is evidence which may suggest that there was a degree of planning on the part of the offender in travelling to the Royal National Park with the deceased, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender's act of killing the deceased was planned. As counsel for the offender pointed out, rocks are commonly found in areas such as that in which the deceased was killed. I accept counsel's submission that the use of a rock, as opposed to some other weapon, would tend against a conclusion that the killing was planned. 

12In R v Hungerford (NSWCCA unreported, 15 December 1993) the Court of Criminal Appeal considered a case in which the appellant had engaged in forced sexual intercourse with the victim before striking the victim's skull with a large piece of concrete, causing her death. McInerney J observed that the primary judge had described the conduct of the appellant in that case as ""barbaric"", and had described the overall offending as ""horrendous"". Such terms are apt to describe the conduct of the present offender. He repeatedly struck the deceased with a rock, and in doing so inflicted serious injuries upon her which caused her death before she was dragged into nearby bushland and abandoned. The offender's use of a rock as a weapon for that purpose aggravates his actions, which occurred against a background of the offending set out in the Form 1. The offending was of the utmost seriousness, and the offender's moral culpability high. 

THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CASE
The offender's background
13A pre-sentence report sets out the offender's background. He is now 43 years of age. He was born in England and is the youngest of four children. He moved to Australia in 1979 and is a permanent resident of this country. He was married at one point and has two daughters with whom he has no contact. 

14The offender left school upon the completion of year 10. He is said to have worked in various short term occupations in (inter alia) the mining and hospitality industries. 

15The offender has had ongoing difficulties with drug use from a young age. The pre-sentence report sets out that he commenced using cannabis at the age of 12, amphetamines at the age of 14, and heroin at the age of 16. He was placed on a methadone program in 2005 and 2006 in respect of his heroin addiction. It would appear that his drug addiction has resulted in most, if not all, of his previous positions of employment being of short duration. 

16The offender was the victim of a major assault in 2005, in which he suffered a traumatic brain injury. As a consequence, he has limited memory of his life prior to 2005, and thus limited memory of the circumstances of his offending. 

17Tendered on sentence was a report of Dr Wayne Reid, Clinical Neuropsychologist, dated 9 December 2013. Dr Reid confirmed that the offender had sustained a significant traumatic brain injury in 2005. However, he expressed some doubts as to the veracity of the offender's claim of memory loss. Ultimately however, the Crown did not submit that I should find that the offender had feigned memory loss and I make no such finding. The position taken by the Crown on this issue renders any detailed examination of Dr Reid's opinions unnecessary.

18The pre-sentence report also documents the offender's other health issues, including an epileptic condition (which appears to be under satisfactory control) and blindness in the left eye. These health issues, and the sequelae from the offender's traumatic brain injury, would appear to explain the fact that at the time of his arrest he was in receipt of a disability support pension, and had the assistance of a carer. It was not submitted on the offender's behalf that any of these health issues would render a custodial sentence more onerous than might otherwise be the case.

The plea of guilty
19The offender was first arraigned before Latham J on 1 November 2013 at which time he entered a plea of not guilty. The matter was listed for trial before me commencing on 3 February 2014. The matter came before me on 13 December 2013, when directions were made to facilitate the determination of various pre-trial issues. It was not until 3 February 2014, the first day of the offender's trial, that the plea of guilty was entered.

20It is well established that the utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should result in a reduction of 10% to 25%. The primary consideration which determines where, within that range, a particular case might fall is the timing of the plea (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309 at 418, 419; [152], [154] and [168](iii) per Spigelman CJ). A discount towards the bottom of the stated range is appropriate for late pleas, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial (see Thomson (supra) at 418; [155]). There are no such benefits evident in the present case. The appropriate discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the offender's plea is 10%.

Remorse
21Whilst the offender did not give evidence before me, counsel tendered (with the consent of the Crown) a letter written by the offender in which he expressed his remorse. The pre-sentence report recorded that upon reading the agreed facts he was ""disgusted and sickened"" at his behaviour. 

22The offender's admission to Ms Duffin was a fundamental cornerstone of the Crown case. I was informed by counsel for the offender that although it was not put before me on sentence, there was evidence at a committal hearing that the offender had made that admission to Ms Duffin because he wanted to relieve himself of the mental burden of what he had done. I did not understand the Crown to take issue with the fact that there was such evidence available.

23In all of the circumstances I am satisfied that the offender is genuinely remorseful for his actions.

The offender's criminal history
24The offender has a history of offending in New South Wales as well as in a number of other states. Such offending occurred both before and after the death of the deceased. Many of the entries are for offences of dishonesty. To the extent that any of the entries relate to violence, they are, in relative terms, of a minor nature. There is certainly nothing in the offender's criminal history which indicates previous violent offending of the magnitude of that which he exhibited in killing the deceased, and there is no history of sexual offending. However, the offender's criminal history disentitles him to leniency. 

The offender's prospects of rehabilitation 
25Accompanying the pre-sentence report was an Actuarial Risk Assessment regarding the offender's suitability for, and access to, sex offender treatment programs. The offender's risk category, in terms of sex offending, was assessed as being ""moderate-high"". However, in determining what weight should be attached to that assessment, it is relevant to note a number of matters.

26Firstly, the assessment was expressly stated to be other than comprehensive. Secondly, the conclusion as to the offender's risk category was reached without the benefit of any direct interview with him. Thirdly, and in circumstances where there was no such interview, the report expressly acknowledged that when considering an offender's risk of further sexual offending, any assessment would ""take into consideration a number of factors obtained through interview and other collateral sources"". Fourthly, as I have already noted, the offender has no history of sexual offending of any kind.

27The pre-sentence report states that since being taken into custody the offender has been employed as a sweeper, a position he has managed to hold down despite the health issues to which I earlier referred. Reports obtained from his supervisors are generally positive. The pre-sentence report also indicates that the offender has successfully completed two courses of retraining since being taken into custody. 

28In light of the matters set out in [26] above, and without intending any disrespect to those who prepared it, I am unable to attach any weight to the risk assessment which accompanied the pre-sentence report. Further, the matters to which I have referred in [27] above are generally positive. 

29In all of the circumstances I regard the offender's prospects of rehabilitation as generally encouraging. Whether they become more favourable over time will necessarily depend upon (inter alia) the offender's willingness to continue what appears to be his present positive approach to rehabilitation. 

THE APPROACH TO SENTENCING
30It was agreed between the parties that in circumstances where the offending occurred in 1992, a determination of the appropriate sentence must be reached having regard to the sentencing practice which applied at that time (see R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; (2002) 54 NSWLR 368; (2002) 130 A Crim R 481 at [31] per Spigelman CJ, Mason P, Grove J, Sully J and Newman AJ agreeing). Counsel for the offender submitted, and I did not understand the Crown to disagree, that the adoption of that approach would necessarily result in the imposition of a sentence which was lower than would be the case if the offending were more recent. 

31The parties agreed that the decisions in R v McDonald (NSWCCA unreported 18 August 1994), R v Webster (NSWCCA unreported 15 July 1991) and Hungerford (supra) provided some guidance as to the sentencing practice which applied at the time of the offending. I accept that submission and have had regard to those authorities. However, it is necessary to bear in mind that care must be taken when comparisons are sought to be drawn between one case and another, for the simple reason that no two cases are the same (see RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236 at [122] per Bellew J, McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing). The aim of all sentencing is to render individual justice and the exercise of sentencing discretion must be directed to fulfilment of that stated aim (see R v Todoroski [2010] NSWCCA 75 at [26] per Grove J with whom Allsop P (as his Honour then was) and Hislop J agreed).

32It is agreed between the parties that any sentence should be backdated to commence on 2 August 2011, being the date on which the offender was taken into custody.

ORDERS
33I make the following orders:

(i)In respect of the offence of the murder of Pia Navida, the offender is convicted.

(ii)The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 16 years and 3 months imprisonment, commencing on 2 August 2011 and expiring on 1 November 2027, with an additional term of 5 years and 3 months imprisonment, commencing on 2 November 2027 and expiring on 1 February 2033.

(iii)The total sentence is one of 21 years and 6 months imprisonment.

(iv)The offender will be eligible for parole on 2 November 2027 and his sentence will expire on 1 February 2033.

		22 May 2014",2014-05-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763976,Workcover v Gunnedah Leather Processors P/L [2014] NSWDC 187,"Judgment

1Gunnedah Leather Processors were summoned to appear before this Court charged with an offence under s 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000. The claim was that there was a risk of injury to the health and safety of Kevin Coe and Craig Baird, namely the risk of moving forklifts hitting them while working or walking in the drum aisle at the premises.


2The particulars of the charge were that the defendant failed to take and should have taken the following steps:


(1)It should have ensured a safe system of work for pedestrian and forklift traffic at the premises, specifically within the drum aisle by marking and enforcing the use of a pedestrian walkway across the drum aisle; and
(2)Ensuring the safe use of forklifts at the premises specifically by governing down the forklifts used in the drum aisle to a set speed or installing speedometers on them and enforcing the signpost at speed limit.


3The particular offence is said to have occurred on 4 January 2011. Apart from an agreed statement of facts to which I will refer briefly, the prosecution tendered some CCTV footage that showed exactly how the accident happened. That footage in itself is very compelling watching, I watched it quite a number of times.


4The defendant is a leather tannery and processing plant and it took over premises at which the offence took place in 2009. With the takeover of the premises it also took over a number of employees who worked for the previous business. A man named Kelly was employed as a worker in the premises; he worked on the treatment of hides and he is also a forklift driver; Mr Coe, who was the man injured in the accident was his supervisor.


5Mr Kelly had been working for the defendant for approximately two years and drove a forklift, although he did not actually have a forklift licence. It is relevant to point out here that the accident is in no way contributed to by the fact that Mr Kelly did not have a forklift licence; he clearly knew how to work a forklift. The accident was caused to a great extent because of the way in which he operated the forklift.


6The chemical aisle or drum aisle as it is sometimes known, is a long concrete aisle between what appear to be some large revolving drums on one side and shelves and equipment on both sides of the aisle. It is approximately 70 metres long and 6 metres wide and it is approximately eight metres from the eastern wall of the building; it runs north, south and it is in fact an aisle that was treated by the employer defendant as a pedestrian exclusion zone, that is, a zone in which pedestrians were prohibited. However, there were no markings or delineations or barricades of any kind to indicate that it was a zone of this type and there was nothing to prevent access to it by pedestrians. Mr Coe was a supervisor and in the normal course of his duties would walk around the factory premises and would cross this aisle despite the prohibitions. The prohibitions apparently not apply to him as such.


7Forklifts would regularly move up and down the aisle. There are approximately 15 forklifts. The one involved in this accident was a gas-powered forklift. It did not have a speedometer. 


8I have examined the film a number of times and it is clear to me that at the time of impact between the forklift and Mr Coe, the forklift was not carrying anything on the front of it that would have impeded the vision of the driver. To some extent, his vision would have been impeded because of the fork itself, but from my looking at the cabin through the film, it would appear to me that he would have had a vision that would enable him to look ahead if he wished to do that. 


9What happened on 4 January was that about 9am Mr Coe, wearing high visibility clothing, came from the drum side of the aisle to the chemical storage side of the aisle. It is clear to me from my looking at the film that he walked straight out into the aisle, walked in a diagonal fashion and did not look to his right or to his left. The forklift was approaching him at a speed which I would think would be well in excess of five kilometres an hour and looked to me more like 20 or 30 kilometres an hour.


10It struck him and it is obvious to me, from my looking at the film, that he did not appreciate that it was anywhere near him until it actually struck him. He did not turn and look until the vehicle had actually hit him. He had a disability at the time, in that his left eye did not actually exist - he had an artificial left eye. Now what happened at the time too, was that another employee Mr Baird who is mentioned in the summons, was operating a jackhammer on the side of the aisle opposite to that in which the revolving drums were operating.


11The sound of the jackhammers drowned out all other sounds in the premises including the sounds of the forklift. There could be no doubt that that would be so, quite apart from that being said in the agreed statement of facts. Mr Baird is shown in the film working in a number of positions moving the jackhammer to a number of places and clearly digging up concrete, he was wearing what appeared to be a full face, or full head mask. There were no barricades anywhere around him to indicate he was present. Mr Coe was wearing a brightly illuminated safety jacket, Mr Baird was not. He was wearing a jacket that had some white bands around it, but certainly it was not nearly as well illuminated as the jacket of Mr Coe.


12The forklift passed Mr Baird at a distance of one to two metres from him. Immediately after the accident Mr Baird looked up, took off his mask, threw it on the ground and ran out of sight waving his arms. Mr Coe was lying on the ground slightly moving. Mr Coe came from a point where his presence would have been invisible to anybody in the aisle and he clearly acted as if he did not expect that there would be any traffic in the aisle.


13The defendant had specified that the speed limit was to be 5 kilometres an hour and on some previous occasions, Mr Kelly the driver had been disciplined for speeding and for using his mobile phone whilst driving the forklift. I have mentioned already Mr Coe's prosthetic left eye, the effect of the impact was to turn him round and fracture the left eye socket, he has been permanently disabled from employment since the accident.


14He suffered traumatic brain injuries, fractures to the base of his skull, multiple facial fractures with residual expressive and reception aphasia, visual agnosia and executive dysfunction. He has not returned to work, although he did give an interview to the Workcover authorities. The defendant factory had before this accident undertaken risk assessments involving forklifts and it had undertaken other risk assessments. It had acted to try to redress the very unsatisfactory way in which the previous factory owner had conducted itself. 


15A traffic management plan was devised, Mr Coe was involved in the implementation of the traffic management plan and ten control measures were recommended, they included the wearing of high visibility clothing, fitting a forklift with beepers and lights, a rule that forklift operators had to give way to pedestrians, induction training for moving plant and a traffic management plan, a need for forklifts to use the reverse, that was particularly if they were carrying a load, the driver was required to drive in reverse so that he could see anybody who might be behind him because with a load on front he could not see anything and also the installation of safety mirrors.


16The traffic management plan also included the marking of pedestrian exclusion zones and that could have involved putting up actual barriers. However, these steps were not taken before the accident. One of the reasons for not putting the markings on the floors was that the floors were greasy because of the nature of the chemicals used in the plant to treat the hides and any painting had to be conducted during the factory shutdown.


17No speed limit signs indicating the maximum speed was 5 kilometres an hour had been installed but all the employees, including Mr Kelly, had been told that was the maximum speed. The forklifts did not have speedometers nor had they been governed down to prevent them exceeding the speed limit. 


18Contrary to the traffic management plan, the company did not ensure that Mr Kelly actually had a certificate of competency or licence to operate the forklift, and I have referred to this earlier. He had in fact undertaken a course that assessed him as competent but had not actually submitted the assessment for processing and conversion to a licence. He had provided a copy of the assessment to the defendant. 


19The injured worker, Mr Coe, who had a supervisory position in the premises, had been the subject of a performance review that indicated his performance needed improvement. But in fact the company did not take any steps to ensure that he improved his safe work practices. I am not quite clear exactly what safe work practices should have been improved because the agreed facts do not indicate that. 


20Mr Coe was Mr Kelly's supervisor and had disciplined Mr Kelly on two earlier occasions, once for speeding. In my view, Mr Coe by marching out into the aisle without looking one way or the other, was taking a risk for his own safety, particularly since it was accepted that forklift vehicles did go up and down this aisle. And he must have been aware at the time he walked into the aisle that the man with the jackhammer, Mr Baird, was working away vigorously and there was a lot of noise. 


21However, clearly enough, it could be said that Mr Kelly should have seen him. If he was keeping a proper lookout he should have seen him. It is hard to understand how he did not see him. Mr Kelly had not been inducted or trained in safety issues or precautions to deal with pedestrians interacting with forklifts. He had been inducted in the operations of the forklift but not in relation to safety. It is obvious, however, he had been told to behave in a better fashion on a couple of earlier occasions. 


22The company has now been given a notice requiring it to ensure that pedestrians and forklift traffic do not occupy shared pathways. The company, it has to be said, gave a final warning to Mr Kelly about his unsatisfactory performance following this accident. It has also taken steps to revise and update the risk assessment for forklifts and amended the control measures and the control measures they have implemented include governing down the speed of forklifts. It implemented all the outstanding matters in the traffic management plan that had not been implemented at the time. They have marked the exclusion zones, they have marked pedestrian walkways, they have bollards and safety chains and they have put push button timed flashing lights at various points to indicate to any forklift operator that pedestrians are in the area. 


23Apart from that, I have been supplied with materials supplied by the solicitors acting for Mr Coe putting forward a victim impact statement which Mr Coe is not capable of doing. I have looked at that victim impact statement. It is a very sad statement as most of the victim impact statements I have ever read are. It is clear that Mr Coe now needs the constant care of his wife. He suffers from very severe injuries. He has no recollection of the circumstances of the accident and his losses are permanent. He has been kept on the payroll of the company and the company have taken steps to visit him and to support his family. 


24I have read the report of the psychiatrist who is treating him. It is very sad. It is clear that he will be in need of permanent care for the future. 


25I am satisfied too from material supplied by the company in the form of an affidavit of Gregory Stephen Osborne with a large number of annexures that the company is a company which has a commitment to workplace health and safety. This was a very unfortunate accident and I am satisfied that since the accident they have taken extensive action to review and improve all their systems in the premises. There is no doubt if they had taken steps before the accident to tell Mr Kelly to drive carefully and at 5 kilometres an hour, they had issued safety vests, and Mr Coe was wearing one, they had not put the markings on the lane and I suppose it could be said they did not make allowance for what I would call the idiot factor, that is, that some workers behave in a totally idiotic fashion and will ignore instructions because from time to time they just could not be bothered taking notice. That appears to be so with Mr Kelly. He was told to drive at five kilometres an hour. They did not have the time regulated on the forklift to prevent him going at a faster speed than that. If they applied what I would call the idiot test they would have done that. The employers have to make allowance for the fact that people will act in a stupid fashion. They cannot assume that people will act reasonably or intelligently. They have got to set up systems that enable people to work safely and that have regard to the fact that some people act foolishly and capriciously. 


26I am convinced on the affidavit of Mr Osborne, and it is not disputed by WorkCover, they had taken steps before this accident to review all their procedures. The unfortunate fact was they had not actually implemented all of them. It could be said Mr Baird, who was placed at risk perhaps of being struck, also behaved in a foolish fashion. He was aware of the need to put barriers around himself when conducting this work; that was a requirement of the defendant. He, however, chose not to do it. Again, all that can be said is the defendant should have had somebody probably going around and saying ""Right, you've got to do that work, where are the barriers? Put them up now."" It is a sad thing that people have to treat their employees as babies at times but I think that is in fact what they have to do. 


27There is little likelihood, in my view, that Mr Baird would have been struck. The forklift driven by Mr Kelly went along a straight line. It was not diverging, it was not wandering all over the corridor, it would be hard to see how it would have struck Mr Baird. Nevertheless if the barriers had been up around him that would have created extra warning to the forklift truck driver that somebody was working there and may have caused him to slow down. 


28I think it is regrettable too that the supervisor, as Mr Coe was, did not advert to the fact that forklifts could be in this area. Now, partly he was deceived I am sure because of the noise created by the jackhammers. He cannot be criticised nor condemned and I am not seeking to do that. 


29There is no doubt that the defendant continues to support Mr Coe. There is no doubt the defendant has since the accident taken steps to totally improve the situation and of course the defendant did alert WorkCover at the earliest opportunity and did plead guilty. 


30The question then arises as to what penalty should be imposed. They have not committed any previous offences. They are not likely to commit any more. Any penalty imposed should have regard particularly, not exclusively but particularly, to the principle of general deterrence. Other factory owners must be aware that even if the factory owner behaves reasonably and properly and takes steps to implement safety measures but does not finally implement them it can be made liable and can be the subject of a fine. 


31In my opinion the company was at some fault but not at extraordinary fault. It would not be appropriate to impose an enormous fine and I impose a fine of $20,000. I order the defendant to pay the costs of WorkCover and I award a moiety to WorkCover. 


32As I understand it, the parties will resolve between themselves the costs. If they cannot resolve it the matter can be dealt with in the usual way by reference to an appropriate cost assessor. 


33I don't think there's anything else I need do, is there?


34PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour.


35HIS HONOUR: Thank you very much for your presentation. I say finally because these proceedings came before me last year. The only reason I have been delayed is that there was an application that ultimately got to the Court of Appeal known as the Empire Waste decision which caused applications to be made to me in this case and in other cases that I not give a decision until that case had been determined. The Court of Appeal determined it some time ago but application was sought for special leave to the High Court and that was abandoned I think only about a week and a bit ago. So when this was drawn to my attention a week and a bit ago I then brought the matter back to give judgment. And I make that plain now in case anybody at any future time should ponder the question why it's taken so long to give a judgment.

36I thank the parties and I will now withdraw.

		05 November 2014",2014-05-22 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763981,R v Ricky Gaganjot SINGH [2014] NSWDC 135,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: On 14 February last after a jury trial lasting some 15 days, the offender was found guilty of the single charge contained in the indictment presented against her, being that contrary to s 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth), on 25 April 2013 at Sydney, she did import a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely methylamphetamine.

2The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment and or 7,500 penalty units.

3The commercial quantity of methylamphetamine relevant to this offence is an amount of 750 grams or higher. In the present matter, there is no issue that the amount of pure methylamphetamine imported was 4.767 kilograms. The bulk amount was 6.9368 kilograms which analysis revealed contained 80.3% pure methylamphetamine.The bulk amount was found inside four chocolate boxes in the offender's luggage which she had brought with her on a flight from Toronto, Canada, via Vancouver.

4At the sentence hearing conducted on 9 May last, there was a dispute as to the facts. The primary area of contention was as to the level of involvement of the offender in the commission of the subject offence.

5In short, the Crown argued that I would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was actually aware that the chocolate boxes found in her luggage which contained the methylamphetamine were filled with some form of illicit substance which she intended to import.

6On the other hand Mr McCrudden, on behalf of the offender, argued that I could not be so satisfied and would find that the offender was reckless as to the importation as defined in the Code.

7In this regard, the Crown case as left to the jury was in the alternative, namely, on the basis of actual knowledge or recklessness on the part of the offender.

8There was no issue that the offender booked her economy class ticket with Air Canada online from her home on 19 April 2013 and picked up the ticket the next day from a travel agent in Toronto, paying at that time some $2,200 Canadian in cash. Her flight was to leave Toronto at 8.20pm on 23 April 2013 and arrive into Sydney at 8.15am on 25 April 2013. Her return flight from Sydney left on 7 May 2013.

9It was also common ground that the offender booked three nights accommodation through an online travel agency the day before she left. Such accommodation was at the Stamford Plaza, Stamford Airport Hotel in Sydney.

10After arriving off her flight on the morning of 25 April 2013, the offender was originally interviewed by Customs officers at Sydney Airport when she denied knowledge of the drugs found but said little else as to the circumstances of the offence. She then spoke to police and made certain offers of assistance to them, a subject to which I will return later, but she declined to give a formal interview.

11Over two months later, in July 2013, the offender provided the Federal Police with an extensive voluntary statement and agreed to be formally interviewed thereafter. She also gave lengthy and detailed evidence at her trial and was in the witness box for almost three days.

12In her voluntary statement and subsequent interview and in her evidence, she maintained that she had agreed to carry certain ""gifts"" as a favour for a person known as ""Sammy"" whom she had met some five or so times in Toronto through a friend named Jessica. She said she first met Sammy on 18 April 2013, some six days prior to her day of departure. She said that in Sydney these gifts were to be picked up by persons known to Sammy but not to her after she telephoned him confirming her arrival whereupon he would contact such persons. She only found out that these gifts included the relevant chocolate boxes when she received them in a suitcase she had asked to borrow from Jessica and noticed them inside. She said she needed to borrow a suitcase as her own luggage had been filled with her possessions in preparation of her moving to Vancouver after her return, a matter which I will refer to later.

13It was the offender's position at trial that in effect Sammy was a very good con artist who worked in conjunction with Jessica and whom befriended the offender and tricked her into taking the chocolate boxes to Sydney in the belief that these ""gifts"" contained only chocolate and that it was not until they were opened by Customs officers in Sydney that the offender realised she had been duped.

14Further, so complete was this deception of the offender that, according to her, at no time was she aware of a risk, substantial or otherwise, that any of the boxes contained an illegal drug or illicit substance.

15It was the Crown's primary position at trial that, in essence, the offender's story was so unbelievable that it should be rejected by the jury whom should find beyond reasonable doubt that she knew there were drugs in the chocolate boxes and she intended to import them.

16As mentioned, the Crown's alternative case was the offender must at the very least have been aware of a substantial risk that one or more of the boxes contained an illicit substance and in the circumstances known to her it was unjustifiable to take that risk and she was therefore reckless in law.

17I do not intend to summarise the evidence of the offender, nor the parties contentions as to facts as contained in MFIs 1 and 2 on sentence. Having sat through all of the evidence, I am strongly suspicious that the offender did know that an illicit substance was inside one or more of the chocolate boxes but I cannot be satisfied of this fact beyond reasonable doubt.

18In this regard, some not insignificant parts of her lengthy description of the events which she said occurred consequent upon being introduced to Sammy were corroborated by her mother and sister whom gave evidence on her behalf.

19The offender also declared the chocolate boxes on her incoming passenger card, although this was after she had been questioned by a Canadian Customs officer during a transit stop at Vancouver Airport about, inter alia, why she had purchased her ticket to Australia shortly before her departure.

20Further, the evidence establishes that the offender paid for her own airline ticket, did not use drugs and was gainfully employed in Canada. She also did not waiver in her evidence despite searching cross-examination and was quite a persuasive witness, at least as to the issue of whether she actually knew what was in the chocolate boxes.

21As I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did know that an illicit substance was inside one or more of the chocolate boxes and therefore intended to import that substance, on the basis of the jury's verdict, I must find that the offender was reckless as defined.

22However, I am not only satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was reckless but that the degree of her recklessness was moderately high and, further, that such recklessness did not arise only after the suitcase containing the chocolate boxes were delivered into the offender's possession as Mr McCrudden argued.

23In this regard the evidence establishes the following matters to the standard mentioned:

(i)The offender had only known Sammy for less than a week.

(ii)Sammy was introduced to her as being a friend of Jessica's boyfriend whom the offender had never met.

(iii)Sammy told her nothing at any point about the ""gifts"" he wished her to bring to Australia.

(iv)Sammy did not deliver the ""gifts"" to the offender until very shortly before she needed to leave for the airport despite her requesting them several times before this.

(v)The offender was told nothing by Sammy about the identity of the persons who were to receive the relevant chocolate boxes in Sydney, nor how to contact them, with the arrangement apparently being that she would contact Sammy upon her arrival and he would then contact them.

(vi)The drugs inside the four chocolate boxes in question were in a crystalline form and effectively filled the entire inside of each box and were not insignificantly heavier than their marked weights. The two ""Laura Secord"" boxes each weighed just under 1.2 kilograms, whereas they were marked ""800 grams"". The two ""Purdy's"" boxes weighed just under 2.4 kilograms, whereas they were marked as 2 kilograms. Even if the marked weights were with respect to their next contents the cardboard and the wrappings did not explain such a differential. These facts would be irrelevant if the offender did not handle the boxes at some point about which there is a dispute. The offender said she did not examine the chocolate boxes at all despite, as was accepted by Mr McCrudden in MFI 2, their amateurish wrapping. Indeed, she gave evidence that the boxes could have contained anything at all. 

She also said that she had no need to touch them as they were in the bottom of the bag when it was delivered to her and she simply packed all her belongings on top of them.I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was not the case as the CCTV footage of the Customs search clearly shows one of the boxes being removed from close to the top of the bag and some of the offender's possessions being removed after some of the other boxes were taken out. This was also the evidence of the relevant Customs officer.

Accordingly, I am similarly satisfied that the offender did handle the boxes at some point which should have revealed something unusual as to their contents because of their weight and or the solid nature of such contents.

I am reinforced in this finding by the history recorded by the psychologist, Dr Protulipac, whose report was tendered on behalf of the offender. In it, he records the offender as stating that she had handled the chocolate boxes ""whilst adding her belongings into the suitcase."" Even if I am wrong in this finding, failing to examine the boxes at all in the circumstances hardly bespeaks a lesser degree of recklessness.

(vii)As mentioned the offender was questioned at Vancouver Airport during a transit stop about a number of matters which in my view should have emphasised to her the risk that she had taken.

24In making this finding of a moderately high degree of recklessness, I have taken into account Mr McCrudden's submission that the offender was at a stressful time in her life based on her corroborated evidence that shortly before coming to Australia her father had died and her family was pressuring her to relocate with them from Toronto to Vancouver, thereby moving her away from her employment, friends and her boyfriend. Even after doing so, I remain satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to this finding.

25As to the issue of presentence custody, the offender has remained in custody since her arrest on 25 April 2013. Accordingly, I intend to backdate the commencement of the sentence imposed below to such date.

26As to the offender's prior criminal history, she was born in Canada on 31 August 1988 and is now 25 years of age. She has no prior history either in that country or in Australia. 

27The evidence referred to below also establishes that, apart from the subject offending, she is of excellent character.

28Whilst I have taken these matters into account in her favour, it is well established that the prior good character of a person involved in a drug importation offence is generally to be given less weight as a mitigating factor on sentence than for many other offences, R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238 at [72]; R v Leroy (1984) 2 NSWLR 441 at [446]-[447]. This principle is of particular relevance in relation to drug couriers where persons with clear records are selected so as not to attract suspicion.

29As to the offender's role, Mr McCrudden submitted that it was likely this was limited to that of a ""mule"" or courier, whereas, the Crown submitted that her role was that of a principal in the importation even if I determined she was reckless as to the content of the chocolate boxes rather than being actually aware that such contents comprised an illicit substance.

30As to her motivation, Mr McCrudden argued that there was no evidence that the offender was paid or was to be paid for her role and he emphasised the evidence established that she bought her own airline ticket and she had not inconsiderable sums of money available to her courtesy of her three jobs in Canada. In essence, he argued that I should find that the offender's motivation was only to do Sammy ""a favour.""

31On the other hand, the Crown argued that there was evidence of the offender needing money for her studies as contained in certain text messages she sent to a person called Sadia in late March 2013.

32The Crown also argued that the ""common sense"" inference to be drawn from the offender's involvement in an importation of methylamphetamine with an agreed street value of almost $4.5 million and an agreed wholesale value of about $1.5 million was for the purpose of profit and I was referred to such decisions as R v Kaldor (2004) 150 A Crim R 271 at [104].

33In Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270 the High Court explained that characterising the role of an offender as a ""courier"" or a ""principal"" must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did.

34However, in the present matter, whilst I am, as stated, strongly suspicious that the offender's role was greater, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what the offender actually did can be characterised as acting as anything more than a courier. In this regard, there is no evidence that she planned the relevant importation or exercised any managerial role or decision making function.

35Nevertheless, whilst it is true that those whose role, as here, can be accurately characterised as that of a courier generally receive a lesser sentence than persons at a higher level in the drug hierarchy (see Tyler v R (2007) 173 A Crim R 458 at [79] - [80]), appellate courts have emphasised that even ""minor participants"" are essential for the successful importation of drugs and therefore play a significant role in that criminal enterprise thereby rendering it necessary for appropriately salutary sentences to be imposed upon them; R v Turkmani (2002) 133 A Crim R 328.

36As to her motivation, the evidence is such that I am unable to determine what factor or factors operated upon the offender's mind. There is no evidence that she herself had ever been addicted to drugs or indeed ever taken any and therefore she was not acting to support a drug habit.

37Whilst I suspect that she may have stood to profit from the importation, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was the case and therefore this aggravating factor is not proved.

38However, I am also not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that she played her part because she wanted to do a ""favour"" for Sammy. In short, on the evidence, her motives remain unclear.

39There was also an issue at the sentence hearing as to whether the offender was entitled to a discount for what was said to be assistance to authorities. During questioning by Federal Police on the day of her arrest, the offender offered to help them by, as I understand her evidence, calling Sammy to arrange for those intended to collect the drugs to meet her so that ""you guys can catch the real criminals"".

40The offender in her voluntary statement also confirmed the telephone numbers of Sammy and Jessica to the police as well as providing Jessica's address and certain other details. 

41The offer to lure such persons into a meeting with the offender was refused by the police whom considered it would be ineffective as the offender had already been detained for some hours when it was made which they believed would have made any persons waiting for the offender realise that she had been detained. However, the phone numbers, address and other details later supplied by the offender were communicated by the Federal Police to their counterparts in Canada but nothing eventuated because they were said to comprise ""insufficient information.""

42Mr McCrudden argued that even though the offender's offers to assist were not taken up and or did not lead anywhere they should still result in some discount on sentence as there was ""no authority against this position.""

43On the other hand, the Crown referred to me to certain comments made by Justice Bryson, with whom the other Justices agreed, in Sukkar v R [2005] NSWCCA 55 at [52] - [53] which he argued are authority for the proposition that if an offer of assistance has no practical value, a claim for a discount based thereon must fail, although it can be taken into account as an indication of contrition and remorse. In my view, Justice Bryson's comments are not quite as black and white as the Crown contends.

44Further, in R v Nguyen; R v Pham; R v Vu; R v To [2005] NSWCCA 362, Justice Grove, with whom Justices Barr and Howie agreed, at [40] pointed out that in sentencing federal offenders, s 16A(2)(h) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act) provides that a Court is required to take into account ""the degree to which the (offender) has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence"" as opposed to, as Justice Grove put it, ""mere consideration of the consequences of cooperation.""

45Further, assistance to authorities takes on particular significance in importation offences because of the ""notorious difficulties of detecting the crime of importation""; R v Wong and Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420 at [83]. The community also has a considerable interest in encouraging couriers to implicate others involved; R v Perrier (No. 2) (1990) 59 A Crim R 164.

46In my view, a modest discount of 5% is appropriate in the current circumstances, which I will apply to the sentence that otherwise would have been imposed.

47In addition to the evidence of contrition and remorse which her offers to assist the authorities provide, the materials on sentence contained various expressions of same on behalf of the offender. Whilst I have taken these into account on her behalf, such materials also contain certain statements which indicate a non-acceptance on her part of the jury's verdict, as well as a tendency to blame others, which operate as countervailing considerations.

48The offender's subjective circumstances, all of which I have taken into account, were outlined by her in considerable detail in her voluntary statement to the Federal Police, subsequent interview and also in her evidence before the jury. In addition, her mother and sister during their own evidence before the jury gave evidence on this topic.

49I have also taken into account the matters referred to in the various testimonials tendered on the offender's behalf.

50Further, at the sentence hearing the abovementioned psychological report from Dr Protulipac dated 3 May 2014 was tendered on her behalf, as was a letter written to the Court by the offender herself dated 4 May 2014.

51As mentioned the offender was born in Vancouver on 31 August 1988. She is now approaching her 26th birthday. She is the youngest in a family of four. Her parents migrated from India and she is of Indian descent. She observes a number of Indian traditions whilst also accepting Western norms. Her father was a goldsmith/jeweller and the family was apparently well-off. Her childhood was happy and healthy. Her older siblings are successful law-abiding individuals.

52The offender spent the first 13 years of her life in Vancouver before moving to Nova Scotia and then Montreal for a short period before the family settled in Toronto where she remained living prior to the commission of the subject offence.

53As to her education, she completed her secondary schooling through private Catholic schools and thereafter enrolled in a college doing social work and was apparently still undertaking this course at the time of her arrest. The offender described having undertaken voluntary work which involved her caring for children and others with various disabilities. 

54She was also engaged in various forms of employment until her arrest. These comprised her own makeup business, working in a local pizza shop and selling gym memberships.

55As to her personal life, prior to her arrest she had been in a romantic relationship for some ten years with a man of whom her mother did not approve. In fact, in 2012, her father attempted to arrange a marriage for her and she went to India for that purpose spending some two weeks there with that man but she then returned to Canada leaving him there, whereupon she resumed her long-term relationship.

56As mentioned, the offender's father passed away on 9 April 2013, leaving her bereaved and her family, as also mentioned, at that point commenced to pressure her to move from Toronto to Vancouver.

57As to the offender's health, she described this to Dr Protulipac as being ""exceptional"". She has no prior psychiatric history and there is none in her family. As mentioned, she has never been involved in taking illicit drugs.

58As stated, the offender has been custody since her arrest in April 2013. She was assessed by Dr Protulipac on 3 May 2014. He was of the view that the offender was of average intelligence. She reported having developed ""severe mental health problems since her arrest"" and had apparently suffered a single episode of psychosis in the form of auditory hallucinations. While she did not report any suicidal ideation, Dr Protulipac opined that her imprisonment had caused ""symptoms suggestive of severe depression"" and he, in fact, diagnosed her to be suffering a major depressive disorder in accordance with DSM 4. He went on to recommend that she should ""continue to attend counselling sessions with a psychologist"".

59Dr Protulipac does not suggest that this condition cannot be appropriately treated in custody, but rather that such custody is the cause thereof, coupled with her ""feelings of injustice and shame"". He also opines that it will be likely to persist whilst ever she remains in custody. 

60While some level of depression is a common consequence of incarceration, I have taken the offender's degree thereof and its likely prognosis into account as factors which will make her imprisonment more onerous for her.

61Further, despite some visits from family members, it is clear that the offender will essentially remain separated from her Canadian family throughout the sentence imposed below which also will be more burdensome upon her for this reason. Whilst I have taken this factor into account in her favour, as well, it is clear on the authorities that it is not deserving of much recognition. R v Huang (2000) 113 A Crim R 386; R v Hendricks (2001) 125 A Crim R 303.

62As to the offender's prospects of rehabilitation, even though she maintains her innocence and there are suggestions in the materials that she believes an injustice has been perpetrated upon her, this does not necessarily mean that these are poor. She is still young, comes from a strong family background and continues to have family support. There is no doubt that her incarceration to date has had a deterrent effect upon her. Also, she has already undertaken considerable study in various courses through the Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre Education Unit, including being the first student in that centre to complete Certificate I in Information, Digital Media and Technology which was offered through the South Western Sydney Institute of TAFE. She has also been employed as the assistant librarian in education at Silverwater for a considerable period and has been described as an excellent student by a senior correctional education officer. Further, she does have a worthwhile life to which she can return.

63Whilst Dr Protulipac emphasises the negative long-term psychological effects that imprisonment will have upon her, he nevertheless is of the view that upon her release she ""will continue with her education and return to her goals and ambitions"".

64Overall, I regard the offender's prospects of rehabilitation as very good, especially if she starts to take more responsibility for her actions.

65As to the objective seriousness of the offending, whilst the offender's role can be correctly characterised as that of a courier, nevertheless, it was still a significant one. I have also found that her level of recklessness was moderately high. Further, the amount of the drugs imported was more than six times the commercial quantity and had a very significant value.

66Overall, I find this offence falls just above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type.

67As to the question of deterrence, offences involving the illegal importation of significant quantities of illegal drugs into this country are extremely serious as reflected by the maximum penalty for the current offence. Drugs cause massive problems in our community, destroying lives, breaking up families and encouraging the commission of other serious crime. General deterrence is of the utmost importance in relation to these sorts of offences. Further, specific deterrence must not be forgotten.

68Pursuant to s 17A of the Act, after considering all available sentencing alternatives and bearing in mind all the matters referred to, especially the objective seriousness of the offending, I am satisfied that no other sentence than one of imprisonment is appropriate in all the circumstances of this case. Indeed, this was the position of both parties.

69Pursuant to s 16A(1) of the Act, any sentence that I impose must be of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. In doing so, I have had regard to all the matters referred to above, including those contained in s 16A(2) of the Act as are relevant and known to the Court.

70In addition, what is the ""severity appropriate"" is to be determined having regard to the general principles identified by the High Court in Power v R [1974] HCA 26.

71In arriving at the sentence imposed, I have also been guided by the approach of McHugh J in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25 at [51].

72The offender is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of nine years and six months commencing on 25 April 2013 and expiring on 24 October 2022.

73Pursuant to s 19AB of the Act, I am required to either fix a non-parole period in respect of the sentence imposed or make a recognisance release order unless I decide that neither is appropriate in which case I must give reasons.

74In Hili v R [2010] HCA 45, the High Court confirmed that all of the circumstances, including the non-inclusive matters referred to in s 16A(2) of the Act, must be taken into account in fixing a non-parole period or making a recognisance release order, just as they must be taken into account in imposing a sentence of imprisonment.

75Further, s 16A(1) of the Act again requires the sentencing Court to fix a non parole period or make a recognizance release order that is of a severity appropriate in the all the circumstances of the offence.

76In addition, the High Court in Hili held that there was no ""norm"" or starting point, whether expressed as a percentage of the sentence or otherwise, for a period of imprisonment that a Federal offender should actually serve before release. The High Court also held that a critical consideration is the determination of the period of imprisonment that justice requires the offender must serve in custody.

77In considering the relevant statutory matters and adopting the approach set out in Power v R, I am mindful of all the matters referred to above. These include, on the one hand, that this is the offender's first time in prison and that she has very good prospects of rehabilitation. To facilitate such rehabilitation, in my view, the offender also needs a longer than normal period of supervision once released into the community. On the other hand, I am again mindful of the overall objective seriousness of the offending.

78In all the circumstances, in my view, justice requires that I set a non-parole period of five years and eight months commencing on 25 April 2013 and expiring on 24 December 2018.

79Ms Singh, I have imposed a total sentence of nine years and six months, commencing from when you first went into custody on 25 April last year. You will be kept in custody for at least five years and eight months from that date, meaning that you will be eligible for parole on Christmas Eve 2018 which is approximately four years and seven months from now. If you are released to parole on that day or a day thereafter, you will still be serving your sentence in the community and you can be returned to custody if you do not comply with the conditions of your parole. You would then continue serving your sentence in custody until it expires on 24 October 2022.

80Do you understand?

OFFENDER: I do.

HIS HONOUR: Have I made any mistakes as to dates or anything of that nature?



MCCRUDDEN: Not that I have noticed, your Honour.


HIS HONOUR: Very well.

2763982,R v Villalon [2014] NSWSC 725,"EX TEMPORE  Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  At the heart of this trial is the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.  The accused is charged with the murder of Keith Chaney and the onus of proof of establishing that partial defence falls upon the accused on the balance of probabilities. 2The accused anticipates that the evidence of Dr Allnutt, Dr Westmore and Dr Furst will be to the effect that at the time of the killing the accused was likely to have been suffering from an undiagnosed and, therefore, untreated paranoid schizophrenia; that is, that he was in the first episode or prodromal stage of psychotic illness.  All three witnesses are psychiatrists.  
3The matter of controversy that has arisen is that the accused seeks to adduce expert evidence of a significantly increased risk of irrational violence during the first episode of, untreated psychotic illness. 
4The Crown objects to the proposed evidence.  The Crown referred to the anticipated evidence of Dr Nguy that the first episode of psychosis was eight weeks after the deceased was killed.  On the other hand, the accused says that Dr Nguy, when he made that assessment, did not have the benefit of the evidence of the members of the accused's family. 5The accused submits that when Dr Nguy's evidence is considered as a whole, it will be clear that Dr Nguy will assess the accused as suffering from a mental illness at the time he killed the deceased. 6The Crown submits that the accused is attempting to adduce evidence that is statistically based, that people like the accused with his history of symptoms are much more likely to commit violent crime and, therefore, it supports a causal connection between the presence of symptoms and the likelihood of committing violent crime.  The Crown contends that the proposed evidence puts forward an argument that there is a higher tendency with people with those symptoms to commit violent crime which is likely to mislead the jury from the focus of their task. 7The Crown submits that the anticipated evidence invites the jury to reason that if the accused has committed a violent crime then episodes of illogical thinking should be interpreted to have been psychotic symptoms rather than irrational thinking.  The Crown submits that the anticipated evidence invites the jury to reason backwards. 8Furthermore, the Crown argues that it is an invitation to the jury to engage in tendency reasoning that if the accused belongs to a category of persons with those symptoms, they have a higher tendency for, or a higher likelihood to commit violent crime. 9The proposed evidence is founded upon two papers, Nielssen, Ryan, Large and Hayes, ""Legal implications of the increased risk of homicide and serious violence in the first episode of psychotic illness"" (the first paper) and, Nielssen and Large, ""Rates of homicide during the first episode of psychosis and after treatment a systematic review and meta analysis"" 2010 Schizophrenia Bulletin 36 pp 706-712 (the second paper).  The lead authors of these research papers are well-respected psychiatrists who hold academic positions, in addition to carrying out private practice.  Dr Nielssen regularly gives expert testimony in trials where an accused is charged with murder.
10In the first paper the authors state, at p 288: 
""There is a greatly increased risk of homicide during the FEP compared to subsequent episodes.  A recently published study from New South Wales and two recent studies from the United Kingdom show that the risk of a patient committing a homicide during the FEP is in the order of one in 500 new cases.  By contrast, the annual risk of homicide by patients who have received treatment is only about one in 10,000 per year.""11The authors state at p 292 that ""Case linkage data showing an increased rate of violent offences by people who develop Schizophrenia prior to the emergence of symptoms of psychosis, or before the symptoms are detected, suggest that the prodrome of mental illness is also associated with an increased predisposition to irrational violence.""  12The authors conclude at p 294: 
""The emerging scientific evidence and increased risk of violence and serious harm during the first episode of psychotic illness has significant implications in civil, criminal and mental health law, as well as effecting conditions and treating agencies."" 13In the second paper, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of ten studies that reported details of all the homicide offenders with a psychotic illness within a known population during a specified period, and reported the number of people who had received treatment prior to the offence.  The authors found that the ratio rate of homicide in the first episode of psychosis in the studies was 15.5 times the annual rate of homicide after treatment for psychosis.  The authors conclude at p 711: 
""The findings of this study suggest that the rate of lethal violence by patients with previously treated schizophrenia is lower than previous estimates.  In contrast, the rate of homicide prior to treatment of psychotic illness is higher than has previously been recognised."" 14The general thrust of the papers was that there was a twenty-fold decline in the risk of homicide after treatment.  The converse of that finding is that the untreated prodromal phase or first episode of a psychotic illness is associated with ""an increased predisposition to irrational violence"". 
15In a report dated 13 May 2014, Dr Furst considers both papers and notes the findings of Dr Nielssen et al, that include a twenty-fold decline in the risk of homicide after treatment.  He provides a summary of the meta-analysis by a scatter plot on p 3. Dr Furst concludes at p 4:
""Given that patients with first episode psychosis often do not recognise their thoughts and symptoms as part of emerging illness.  Dr Nielssen expressed an opinion that such individuals should be regarded as having a lower level of criminal responsibility.  I would concur with that opinion, both generally in offenders facing the Courts in New South Wales and elsewhere for homicide and serious violence offending specifically in the case of [the accused]."" 16In a report dated 9 May 2014, Dr Westmore refers to the first paper and concludes at p 2: 
""The article you have provided me with indicates that there is increasing research evidence to suggest that the prodromal phase of a psychotic illness is also associated with 'an increased pre-disposition to irrational violence'.  It is possible that [the accused] fits into the category of patients described in the article."" 17Both Dr Furst and Dr Westmore have many years experience as treating psychiatrists and forensic experts.  They have given expert evidence in murder cases for many years.  Their specialised knowledge, based on their training, study and experience, enables them to give expert evidence in the trial concerning the findings of Dr Nielssen et al, s 97 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). 18I am told that Dr Allnutt, Dr Westmore and Dr First in the accused's first trial gave evidence to substantially the same effect; namely, that the accused was suffering from untreated prodromal schizophrenia at the time he killed his stepfather. The anticipated evidence of Dr Westmore and Dr Furst as to the increased risk of irrational violence during the untreated prodromal stage of a psychiatric illness could rationally effect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of two facts in issue in the trial; namely:
(1)  whether the accused's capacity to understand events or judge whether his actions were right or wrong, and/or his capacity to control himself were substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind from his undiagnosed mental illness; and 
(2)  whether his impairment was so substantial to warrant his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 19It appears to me that there is ample evidence from the family members for the psychiatrists to find that the accused, at the time that the deceased was killed, was in the prodromal stage of schizophrenia.  20The accused bears the onus of establishing these matters on the balance of probabilities. 21I do not agree with the Crown submission that the proposed evidence invites the jury to reason backwards.  The anticipated evidence, as Ms Manuell SC for the accused submits, could have the effect of explaining to the jury, ""in expert psychiatric terms the lack of understanding, insight and control that is significantly more likely to be experienced by a person in the untreated prodromal stage of a psychotic illness, compared to a person who suffers from the illness, but who is treated; or, to a person who does not suffer from the illness"" (AWS at par 14). The evidence is relevant: s 55 Evidence Act. 22I do not consider that evidence of research findings that a person who is in the untreated prodromal stage of a psychotic illness is at a significantly increased risk of irrational violence is tendency evidence.  The anticipated evidence is not ""evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of [the accused], or a tendency that the accused has or had"": s 97 Evidence Act.  The evidence is not specific to the accused but it is generic evidence based on research applicable to a particular class of person.  23As Ms Manuell points out, the anticipated evidence is similar to evidence that is regularly given in criminal trials by pharmacologists as to the likely effect of alcohol consumption on a person's behaviour. The ""evidence derives not from the expert's assessment of the particular accused at the time of the alleged offence, but from the results of studies, where the behaviour of a number of intoxicated people has been observed and documented"" (AWS at p 22).   24Section 135 of the Evidence Act is as follows:  
""The Court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:
(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or
(b) be misleading or confusing, or(c) cause or result in undue waste of time."" 25The evidence sought to be adduced is relevant to a core issue in this trial, the partial defence of substantial impairment.
26The evidence has significant probative value.  The Crown has been served with the reports of the psychiatrists and the research papers.  The Crown has had a reasonable opportunity to obtain the views of Dr Allnutt who is to be called in the Crown case. In my view there is no unfair prejudice to the Crown, nor is the evidence misleading nor confusing, nor will it result in undue waste of time.  
27I do not propose to refuse to admit the evidence.

2763987,R v Alexandridis [2014] NSWSC 662,"ex tempore Judgment (REVISED)
Application for Bail

VIDEO LINK COMMENCED

1HIS HONOUR: Mr Mario Alexandridis applies for bail and seeks a release order in relation to the charge of threatening a person with intent to influence as a witness. That is an offence under s 322(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). I am told and I accept that it is a strictly indictable offence. 

2Mr Alexandridis is represented by Mr James, of Queens Counsel and the Crown by Mr Shaw. The Crown opposes bail. 

3The case falls to be determined under the provisions of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) (""the Act"") which came into operation this week. The Act made significant changes to the law in relation to bail but it leaves the fundamental principles of our criminal justice system in place. The major change effected by the Act is that it abolishes the previous system of presumptions, which applied under the Bail Act 1978 (NSW) and the scores of amendments that have been made to that Act over the years. 

4A bail authority, including a court, is no longer required to consider the application by reference to whether there is a presumption in favour of bail, a presumption against bail, or no presumption either way. Rather, the Act says that before making a bail decision a bail authority ""must"" consider whether there are ""unacceptable risks"": see s 17(1).

5The relevant risks are set out in s 17(2) and they are whether the accused person, if released on bail, will fail to appear, commit a serious offence, endanger the safety of victims and individuals of the community or interfere with witnesses or evidence. 

6Subsection (3) sets out an exhaustive list of the ""only"" matters to be taken into account in determining whether there is an unacceptable risk. Those matters are:
Requirement to consider unacceptable risk - s 17(3)
""(a) the accused person's background, including criminal history, circumstances and community ties, 
(b) the nature and seriousness of the offence, 
(c) the strength of the prosecution case, 
(d) whether the accused person has a history of violence, 
(e) whether the accused person has previously committed a serious offence while on bail, 
(f) whether the accused person has a pattern of non-compliance with bail acknowledgments, bail conditions, apprehended violence orders, parole orders or good behaviour bonds, 
(g) the length of time the accused person is likely to spend in custody if bail is refused, 
(h) the likelihood of a custodial sentence being imposed if the accused person is convicted of the offence, 
(i) if the accused person has been convicted of the offence and proceedings on an appeal against conviction or sentence are pending before a court, whether the appeal has a reasonably arguable prospect of success, 
(j) any special vulnerability or needs the accused person has including because of youth, being an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, or having a cognitive or mental health impairment, 
(k) the need for the accused person to be free to prepare for their appearance in court or to obtain legal advice, 
(l) the need for the accused person to be free for any other lawful reason.""

7Subsection (4) set outs a non-exhaustive list of the matters to be taken into account or in considering whether an offence is a serious offence. It includes matters such as whether or not the offence is one of a sexual or violent nature, whether there were weapons involved, the likely impact of the offence on the victim and the community and the number of offences that are likely to be committed. 

8If there is no unacceptable risk, the accused person should be released without bail, on unconditional bail or bail should be dispensed with: s 18. If there is an unacceptable risk, the Court will either grant conditional bail or refuse bail: s 19. 

9Section 20(1) is a critical provision in the Act, and it is in the following terms: 
""A bail authority may refuse bail for an offence only if the bail authority is satisfied that there is an unacceptable risk that cannot be sufficiently mitigated by the imposition of bail conditions"".

10It can be seen that s 20 casts an onus on the party opposing bail. The standard of proof for all matters to be determined under the Act is provided by s 32 and the standard is the balance of probabilities. As I have said the Act does not change certain fundamental concepts that lie in the heart of our criminal justice system. An accused person is presumed to be innocent. The ultimate standard of proof before punishment that can be imposed by the State is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And third, an accused person is generally entitled to be at liberty until the resolution of the allegations made against them. 

11In that last respect, the words of Sperling J in R v David Peter Cain (No. 1) (2001) 121 A Crim R 365 continue to apply. His Honour spoke of the interests of the applicant, his legitimate claim to be at liberty and to be with his family living a lawful life pending trial. In that case, the applicant had been in custody for a year and was likely to stay in custody for a further year before trial. His Honour concluded by saying this:
""The prospect that a private citizen who has not been convicted of any offence likely imprisoned for as long as two years pending trial is, absent exceptional circumstances, not consistent with modern concepts of civil rights."" 

12That was the position under the Bail Act 1978 and it continues to be the position today. The length of the adjournment or remand period is a matter specifically referred to in s 17(3)(g). So that in assessing whether there is an acceptable risk, one of the factors to be taken into account is the length of time the accused person is likely to spend in custody if bail is refused. 

13Under the new regime, bail applications will continue to be heard with a degree of informality and the Act provides that the rules of evidence do not apply: see s 31. 

14In the context of what happened in this Court yesterday, that provision is also important because it says that a bail authority, and that includes a court, can take into account any evidence or information that the bail authority considers ""credible or trustworthy"". 

15That brings me to the present application. To understand the decision that I have come to, it is necessary to set out a brief chronology of the events and the allegations. 

16On 13 January 2014, an incident occurred at premises in Manning Road, Double Bay. That is the residence, as I understand it, of the alleged victim and her mother. The alleged victim was, for a number of years, involved in an intimate relationship with the applicant. They have been married for five years and had children together. Up until those events, it seems that the applicant had regular access to his children. The alleged victim's mother had a dental surgery downstairs. 

17The incident, as it is alleged, involved the applicant entering the premises and using a firearm, which is described in the fact sheet as a ""small black firearm"". The gun was allegedly discharged, not in the direction of any person but by firing it into the floor. It said that the police found a bullet hole in the floor and it is also said, and I think accepted, that a gun was subsequently surrendered to the Crime Commission by the applicant's previous solicitor. I am told that the ballistics evidence may support the proposition that the surrendered gun was the gun used on 13 January, but I gather from Mr James' submission that there may be some issues surrounding the use and admissibility of that evidence, due to the circumstances in which the gun was surrendered. 

18In addition to firing the gun, it is alleged that the applicant also made various demands of the occupants. I have only briefly referred to the facts of that case because for present purposes it simply sets the backdrop to the questions I have to decide. 

19Importantly, from the point of view of considering one of the unacceptable risks referred to in s 17 (the risk that the applicant might fail to appear), the undisputed fact is that later on the night of 13 January 2014, the accused voluntarily attended the Burwood Police Station and surrendered himself to police. 

20The facts as I have recounted them, are not only incomplete but they are, I gather, subject to dispute and the dispute will be ultimately litigated in another court. 

21On 27 March 2014, Davies J, sitting in the Bail Court granted the applicant conditional bail. In the course of submissions yesterday, I asked Mr James whether I have the power to revoke that bail. Mr James said first that I do have such a power but secondly, he said, and forcefully so, that I would not do so given that (1) there was no application by the prosecution for me to do so and (2) that bail has been granted after a considered decision by a judge of this Court. I accept the second part of that submission and I need not come to any conclusion as to the first part.

22I accept that the applicant complied with the conditions of bail that were provided by Davies J, at least for a period of time. 

23On 29 April 2014, two relevant things happened. First, the applicant attended the Central Local Court in accordance with his bail undertaking. Secondly, four people attended the premises at Manning Road, Double Bay where the incident on 13 January had occurred. By April, the alleged victim's mother had arranged for new security systems to be put in place. She did this in response to the events of 13 January. In the event, it seems that those new systems foiled the attempts of those four people from entering the premises. The four people used a ruse in their attempt to enter the premises. One of them, a woman, pretended that she was a patient of the dental practice downstairs. It seems that she dressed in a way that assisted her to blend into the environment that is Double Bay.

24When they got past the first door the woman decamped and the men attempted to go further into premises but they could not get past a second door which a receptionist within the dental practice was able to lock. As I understand it, all of this was captured on closed circuit television footage and the perpetrators who attempted to enter the premises are nominated in the statement of facts associated with that charge. Importantly, it is said that hammers were produced and there were attempts to put on balaclavas. The applicant was not present. He was at the Central Local Court. 

25When the matter came before me yesterday in the bail list two things happened. The first is that I asked Mr Shaw for the Crown what evidence there was to connect the applicant to the events at Double Bay on 29 April 2014. I suggested to him that I had read the facts sheet and the evidence therein connecting him appeared to be ""gossamer thin"". Mr Shaw accepted that description. In a nutshell, the evidence was, first, the temporal coincidence between the applicant's attendance at court and the incident at Double Bay. The police and prosecution say that this was no coincidence but was a calculated attempt to provide the applicant with an alibi. Secondly, the location of the incident was the home of the applicant's estranged wife and children and mother. Thirdly, an association was said to exist between the applicant and one of the four people involved in the incident. That person is Dimitrios Simitci.

26The second thing that happened at the outset of the bail application was that Mr James raised an objection to part of the material tendered by the prosecution and in particular part of a letter that had been prepared by Detective Sergent Paul Mangan for consideration of the court. The part of the letter that was objected to was the suggestion on page 5 that there was evidence that the applicant and Simitci had agreed that the four people would attend the Double Bay premises for the purpose of threatening the victim and other witnesses into withdrawing their statements in relation to the original incident. Mr James said that there was no evidence to support that assertion. I raised with Mr James the fact that there was similar material in the fact sheet and asked Mr Shaw whether there was in fact any evidentiary support for those suggestions or whether it was purely speculation. Mr Shaw told me that there was material to support the allegation but that it had not been served on the defence.

27At that stage I adjourned the case until later in the day and allowed time for the detectives who investigated this allegation to attend court. Some hours later they did so and produced a compact disc containing a record of interview with the man Simitci. There then developed a dispute between the parties as to what was said in the interview and through the industriousness of the applicant's solicitor I was provided with a truncated synopsis which became ultimately exhibit 2. I was told yesterday that the police disputed parts of the synopsis but I have determined for the purposes of the application that it is ""credible or trustworthy"" material for the purpose of s 31(1) of the Act.

28In any event because of the confusion surrounding the evidence I indicated that it would be preferable if it was entirely clear exactly what Mr Simitci had said. The reason for that is that Exhibit C before me is a statement from Mr Simitci and that statement indicates that he is prepared to give evidence in accordance with that recorded interview. In the absence of the recorded interview the statement is bordering on meaningless. Plainly, if there is evidence supporting a connection between the applicant and the events which took place in Double Bay on 29 April 2014 from Mr Simitci then what I have described as ""gossamer thin"" may become compelling evidence supporting the motive for that behaviour that is asserted by the Crown.

29The synopsis which was Exhibit 2 included the fact that Simitci had been asked by the applicant to approach ""Sandra and ask her to drop the charges"". It was also said that Simitci was to ""talk to Sandra and see if we can get custody of the children back for her to drop the statements"". Later in the extract prepared by the applicant's solicitor Simitci said that he was to ""ask if the statements can be dropped nicely and that the applicant was neither angry nor desperate"". Mr James relies on other aspects of the extract to submit that the use of hammers, balaclavas and other methods of intimidation were not the idea of his client but either the result of Mr Simitci going beyond the scope of his instructions or his co-offenders doing so.

30This morning the prosecution was in a position to tender Exhibit B which purports to be a transcript of the interview. One thing it does show is that the efforts of the applicant's solicitor yesterday are to be commended. Nearly everything, if not everything, that she had put in her synopsis can be found in the 357 questions and answers of the record of interview. It is unnecessary for me to go into chapter and verse as to what was said but it is the case that in question 36 Simitci says that his cousin (Mr James accepts that that is the applicant) was asked to go and speak to Sandra with a view ""to get his kids back to drop the charges"". The answer to question 36 indicates that Simitci was asked by the applicant to go and speak to Sandra ""and get his kids back, to drop the charges"". Again at question 49 the potential witness says that he is asked if he could ""just talk to Sandra and see if we can get custody back, to drop the statements and that for her to drop the statements"". 

31At questions 90 to 91 the witness was asked why did they do it on Tuesday and he answered ""[because] of court."" In question 91 he was asked to explain what that meant and he said, ""Well, my cousin would have been in court so"" and the police officer drew the conclusion for him that it would mean there was no way that he, the applicant, could have been there. His answer was ""Yep."" Again at question 103 there is reference to the objective being for Sandra to drop the statements but in that same question and answer there is much that Mr James relies on which is that he was not there to hurt them. In that answer the witness introduced the word ""intimidate"" when he said ""Well in a way like intimidate but not to hurt her."" Mr James has pointed me to a number of questions and answers which show that it was not the witness who introduced the concept of intimidation into the conversation and there is some confusion at the very least surrounding that. He also notes that the witness himself says that he was asked to talk to Sandra ""nicely"" and that it seems on one reading of what happened, Mr Simitci went well beyond the scope of the request that had been made of him by the applicant.

32I will just note in passing that there was material in the fact sheet which contained evidence that the applicant himself and members of his family were the victims of shooting incidents at their home and directed toward one of their cars. The facts go on to say that the applicant failed to report those incidents to the police. Mr James made a forceful submission that I should give no weight to those matters and I accept that submission. Indeed, this morning the prosecutor very fairly accepted that that material was irrelevant for present purposes.

33I then come to an assessment of whether there are unacceptable risks for the purposes of s 17. Making such an assessment is incapable of precision as it involves an exercise in prediction. Bail authorities do not have a crystal ball. They are not soothsayers. However, making predictive evaluations of risk is not a task that is foreign to the courts. Such predictions are made under other bail regimes throughout Australia, see for example Williams v DPP [2001] 1 QR 99, Dale v DPP [2009] VSCA 212 and Woods v DPP [2014] VSC 1. Such predictions of future potential risk are also made in the context of various statutory regimes in which the executive applies to have an offender detained beyond the expiration of their sentence or where family law orders are designed for the protection of children, see for example Fardon v Attorney-General (Qld) (2004) 223 CLR 575 and M v M (1988) 166 CLR 69 and such evaluations are also part of the sentencing process when suggestions of future dangerousness arise, see for example Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [53].

34As the cases on bail show and as common sense dictates, no grant of bail is risk free. The question under s 17 is whether the risk is an acceptable one. In determining that question the court can only - and I underline only - take into account the various matters in s 17(3). 

35I have considered those matters insofar as they are relevant to the applicant's bail application. Having taken those matters into account and taking the most benign view of all of the circumstances, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there is an unacceptable risk that if granted bail the applicant would make an attempt to interfere with witnesses, pursuant to s 17(2)(d). In doing so I am also satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there is a risk that he would commit serious offences and endanger the safety of the alleged victims: s 17(2)(b) and (c). I am not satisfied that there is an unacceptable risk that he will fail to appear: s 17(2)(a).

36Mr James has submitted amongst many other things that continuing to have the applicant in custody may not rule out the possibility that others may act on his behalf. Indeed, if accepted, anything that happened in the second incident and the one with which I am concerned happened in the absence of the applicant. I accept the logic of that submission to a point but I am firmly of the view that the applicant would find it far easier to interfere with the witnesses if he is at large.

37I should say that in making the assessment of risk that I have taken into account the plain fact that the applicant enjoys excellent support of members from his family and friends and the fact that his record is not one that causes significant concern. Although he does have a prior record, it is not a record of any significance. Apart from the incident in question there appears not to be any evidence that he has previously failed to comply with bail conditions or apprehended violence orders or previously committed serious offences on bail. A matter of great concern when considering s 17 and s 20 is the length of time that this case will take to come on for hearing. I have also taken into account the need that he has to be free for other lawful purposes - in particular, his preparation for the court case. However, the nature and seriousness of the offence and what I now see to be the perceived strength of the case have led me to that conclusion. 

38Of course that is not the end of the matter. The question turns on whether there are conditions of bail that are capable of mitigating the unacceptable risks that I have found exist: s 20(1) of the Act. In determining that question the onus is placed on the prosecutor and I must determine the question on the information available and on the balance of probabilities. As I have said, I do not take into account the material in the police letter to which objection has been taken but I do take into account the evidence which has now been placed before me in the electronically recorded interview. 

39I note that when the matter was before Davies J on 27 March a number of conditions of bail were imposed. That included non-association orders, non-communication orders, residence orders and curfew orders. In particular the applicant was ordered not to communicate directly or indirectly except through his legal advisers with any person of whom he has received notice is to be called or is likely to be called by the Crown at his committal hearing or trial. He was ordered not to associate or communicate in any way with people whom I will not name here but some of them are people who live at the relevant address in Double Bay. 

40There is no explanation for the events of 29 April 2014 and what appeared initially to be a ""gossamer thin"" case now becomes a strong case, at least in the sense that the purpose of the visit there by those people was to influence witnesses regarding the statements they gave in offences of great seriousness. It is difficult to escape that conclusion based on both the temporal coincidence and the comment in the record of interview that the reason they went there when they did was so that the applicant would be at court and thus unable to be identified as part of the approach to the witnesses. 

41While Mr Simitci does eschew any violent suggestions on the part of the applicant, the reality is that sophisticated enough attempts were made to breach the security. The use of balaclavas and hammers (which I am told 'just happened' to be there because there were workers in Double Bay using such tools) cause me great concern. 

42In view of that history and in spite of the strength of the applicant's family support, the thorough submissions of Mr James and the extremely stringent conditions which amount to house arrest which he proposes, I regard that I am satisfied on balance that the unacceptable risks that I have identified cannot be sufficiently mitigated by the imposition of bail conditions.

43 Accordingly, bail is refused.

		27 May 2014",2014-05-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763988,Application by Robert Roberti pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2014] NSWSC 683,"DECISION
1R A HULME J:  The applicant was convicted by a jury of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a commercial quantity of cocaine into Australia contrary to s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). 
2The applicant was tried with six co-accused, all of whom were found guilty. His co-offenders were Garry Bartle, Maximiliano Diez, Peter Fox, Sir Thomas Fry, Thomas McCaffrey and Hamish Thompson. Russell Douglas Bateman was also involved in the enterprise but pleaded guilty and was sentenced by James J:  R v Bateman [2000] NSWSC 915.
3The applicant's trial lasted for almost eight months, commencing on 5 February 2001 and concluding on 13 September 2001. 
4The applicant was sentenced by the trial judge, Dodd DCJ, to imprisonment for 24 years with a non-parole period of 16 years.
5An appeal against both conviction and sentence was dismissed on 3 December 2003: R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329; 181 FLR 1.
6The applicant now seeks an order under s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) for the whole case to referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
Facts
7The Crown case at trial was summarised in R v Bartle at [4]-[47].  The following is a brief overview drawn from that summary.
8On 1 February 2000, Mr Roberti and his co-offender Thompson were arrested on a boat in Patonga, north of Sydney, which had 383 kilograms of pure cocaine (502 kilograms gross) on board. 
9There was no dispute at trial that Thompson, Fry and the applicant had sailed the boat into Australian waters with the cocaine on board. The boat (""Ngaire Wha"") was purchased in New Zealand and set out from the Bay of Islands. It met with another ship that had travelled from Panama and the cocaine was transhipped to the Ngaire Wha. The Ngaire Wha then continued on to Australia and landed at Patonga Beach.
10The applicant had travelled to New Zealand on 29 November 1999 in order to help repair a boat (""Lone Bird"") that was originally meant to make the voyage from New Zealand. The applicant worked on the instruction of Fry, who purchased the Lone Bird with money that Bateman had transferred to him from Melbourne. 
11Soon after the applicant arrived in New Zealand a decision was made to use another vessel and the Ngaire Wha was purchased. Thompson was the purchaser but Bateman transferred the purchase price (NZ$157,000) to Thompson soon after the purchase was made. This included AUD$100,000 lent to Bateman by McCaffrey. 
12Between 8 and 13 December 1999 Bartle, Thompson, Fry and the applicant saw to the trial, purchase and repair of the Ngaire Wha in Auckland. On 9 and 10 December, Thompson, Fry and the applicant travelled to Gisborne, where the Lone Bird was being kept, and collected equipment and supplies from it to be used on the Ngaire Wha. 
13On 12 December 1999, Fox flew to New Zealand and collected radio equipment and photographs taken by the applicant and Bartle and delivered them to Bateman in Melbourne. The applicant assisted Fox while he was in New Zealand. 
14Between 15 and 22 December Fry, assisted by the applicant and Bartle, sailed the Ngaire Wha to the Bay of Islands, from where it was to depart for the rendezvous with the suppliers' vessel. Bartle distributed funds he acquired from Bateman to the applicant and Thompson as required. Thompson took over this role after Bartle flew to Melbourne to meet Bateman. 
15Bateman repaid McCaffrey the AUD$100,000 on 16 December 1999. McCaffrey provided money to Bartle and the applicant, assisted with flights and communicated with Bateman. 
16The applicant was to crew the Ngaire Wha but Bateman was concerned about his reliability and so he sent Fox to keep an eye on him. Fox, Thompson, Fry and the applicant remained in the Bay of Islands preparing the Ngaire Wha for its voyage. Fox, Thompson and the applicant sailed out of the Bay of Islands on 14 January 2000 and rendezvoused with the suppliers' yacht - the Bora Bora II - on about 17 January. The cocaine was transhipped from the Bora Bora II to the Ngaire Wha and the Bora Bora II continued to New Zealand, arriving on 19 January. 
17A tender vessel was purchased to use in transferring the cocaine off the Ngaire Wha and landing it, but it was not used in the end. The Crown reasoned that it must have been decided to land the Ngaire Wha and unload the cocaine directly onto land. 
18Bateman, McCaffrey, Fox and Bartle booked a motel on 31 January 2000 at Parsley Bay, opposite Patonga. They arranged vehicles to be used to offload the cocaine. At 12.11am on 1 February Fox's phone was used in an attempt to contact the satellite phone on the Ngaire Wha. At 2.46am the Ngaire Wha was stationary off Patonga beach. Fry disembarked and was later arrested under the wharf. 
19The applicant and Thompson were arrested on the yacht. Bateman, Bartle and Fox were arrested at Brooklyn boat ramp. McCaffrey avoided arrest but was later arrested on 15 September 2001.  
The applicant's evidence at trial
20A summary of the applicant's evidence at trial is provided in R v Bartle at [284]-[286]:
""[284] Roberti gave evidence. He said that he had known Bateman since the early 1980s. Bateman asked him to go to New Zealand in November 1999 to work on a yacht he was bringing to Australia to charter for the Olympic Games. He obliged. He used a passport in the name of Brian Russell because Bateman had stolen papers he had gathered to apply for a passport. He later learned that Bateman had thereby obtained a passport in Roberti's name. For the same reason Roberti also had a passport in the name of James Simmons. Bateman had organised that for him. 
[285] Roberti agreed about the role he had played in Gisborne, Auckland and the Bay of Islands. He said that when they sailed out of the Bay of Islands he thought that they were going on a sea trial of the Ngaire Wha. However, once they were at sea Fry told him that they were continuing on to Australia. He realised that there were parcels on board. Fry told them that the contents were clay. He did not believe Fry but thought that it might have been marijuana. Fry continued to insist that it was clay. Telephone calls he had made from the Ngaire Wha to Bartle were to ask Bartle to ask Bateman to get in touch with him so that he could inform Bateman about his predicament. 
[286] Roberti told the police that he thought that the contents of the parcels were clay. He explained at trial that he had said that because that was what Fry had told him. He said that he had used the name James Simmons when questioned by the police because he was shaken up and frightened. He denied knowing that the Ngaire Wha was carrying cocaine.""
The appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal
21The applicant and six of his co-offenders appealed against their convictions and sentences. Fox, McCaffrey and Thompson had their convictions quashed and new trials were ordered. The rest of the offenders, including the applicant, had their appeals against conviction and sentence dismissed. Crown appeals against sentence were also dismissed. 
22The applicant raised nine grounds of appeal in his amended grounds of appeal against his conviction.  Two are said to be relevant to the present application.  Ground 5 was as follows:
""The trial judge erred in that he failed to discharge the jury as a result of persistent, improper questioning by the Crown Prosecutor causing an outburst from Mr Roberti in which he made admissions as to his criminal antecedents and the antecedents of fellow co-accused.""
23Ground 7 asserted that:
""The trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion in that he failed to discharge the jury following the Crown closing, in which the Crown referred to evidence previously struck from the record.""
24None of the grounds raised any complaint about the trial judge sleeping during the trial. It appears from the letters attached to this application that this was because the applicant had been advised that it could not be raised as a ground of appeal. 
The current application
25The applicant asserts in his application that grounds 5 and 7 in his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, extracted above, should be re-considered ""in the light of the contention that Judge Dodd slept through portions of the trial"". 
26In particular, in respect of ground 5 it was submitted that:
""the sleeping judge was likely to have distracted the jury at a crucial time and that he failed to properly supervise the cross-examiner in circumstances where defence counsel had unsuccessfully objected on numerous occasions during the course of the cross-examination"". 
27In relation to ground 7 it was submitted that:
""the sleeping judge could be said to have contributed indirectly to a flaw in the proceedings that gives rise to a doubt or question to a part of the evidence in the case"". 
28The basis of the current application arises out of various affidavits provided by the applicant. The affidavits collectively assert that the trial judge was asleep at various times during the trial and the applicant contends that this gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
29The applicant also relies on various letters. They confirm that he had attempted to raise the sleeping judge point as a ground of appeal, both in the Court of Criminal Appeal and subsequently in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade lawyers that there should be an appeal to the High Court of Australia. 
Affidavit evidence
30The applicant's affidavit was sworn on 31 December 2012. It indicates that early on in the trial, he began to hear snoring. The judge's associate would cough or bang the bench wall with her elbow and the snoring would stop and the judge would wake up. This happened very often throughout the trial. Most times he looked over at the judge and he would be slouched with his eyes closed. By the middle stages of the trial the jury were themselves nodding off whenever the judge was asleep. 
31The applicant then isolates 12 specific points in the trial transcript during which he remembers the trial judge was sleeping and/or woken up. He also indicates that he raised the issue with his solicitor and counsel but no action was taken until four months into the trial when counsel for the applicant passed a note to the judge's associate.  It is said that ""the Judge replied to that note saying he was up late with other commitments as well as going through our case - this was happening day after day without any explanation"". 
32Mr John Spencer of counsel appeared for Mr Roberti at trial. His affidavit, sworn on 25 February 2012 indicates the trial judge fell asleep several times throughout the trial. By the middle and later stages of the trial the judge would fall asleep at least five to six times per week. ""On most occasions you could hear the Judge snoring. His Associate would on each occasion cough very loudly or do other things to wake the Judge up."" The jury would ""often be distracted by the fact that the Judge was asleep and would often need to be woken up by his Associate. They would look in his direction when he was asleep"".
33Ms Dianne Fiedler is the applicant's sister. Her affidavit was sworn on 26 May 2011. She attended the trial on 23 July 2001. During the day she was nudged by Sue Goodie [sic], a friend of the applicant's, who whispered: ""The Judge is sleeping"". She then looked at the judge and saw him with his head down, his chin resting on his collarbone and his eyes closed. She could not see the jury from where she was sitting. During an interval she approached one of the lawyers in the trial and said: ""Excuse me but the Judge is sleeping"". The lawyer replied: ""He knows what is going on"". 
34Ms Sue Godde's affidavit was sworn on 23 January 2013. She attended approximately 20 weeks of the trial, between 5 February and 13 September 2001. On numerous occasions she noticed that the judge's eyes were closed and that his head was tilted forward for extended periods.
The law applicable to the current application
35The applicant seeks to have his case referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act. Section 79 provides:
""(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion: (a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or (b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 . 
(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case. 
(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if: (a) it appears that the matter: (i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or (ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or (iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or (iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and (b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action. 
(3A) ... 
(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application. 
36Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 summarised the principles applicable to an application under s 79:
""[6] The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). With respect to repealed s.475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s.475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s.79(2): Application of Pedrana (2000) 117 A Crim R 45 at 463 [28]; Application of Suey [2001] NSWSC 543 at [18].
[7] Where it is contended that a doubt or question exists concerning part of the evidence in the case, it is appropriate to consider whether any doubt or question about that part of the evidence produces a doubt or question as to guilt: Application of Moore [2000] NSWSC 364; (2000) 112 A Crim R 331 at 332 [6]. The section is to apply to a part of the evidence which has some real material substance as effecting the conclusion of guilt: Application of Suey at [19]
[8] There has to be available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet: Application of Esposito (Hunt J, 14 July 1988, unreported at page 2); Application of Visser (Newman J, 27 June 1994, BC9402667 at page 3); Application of Dunn [2005] NSWSC 857 at [9].
Some Other Features of the Jurisdiction9 The procedure under s.78 is not intended to provide a convicted person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted: Application of Dunn at [9]; Application of Milat [2005] NSWSC 920; (2005) 157 A Crim R 565 at 574 [26]. Nor is it an opportunity, in a sense, to run the trial again on paper, with the ultimate submission that acquittal should result.""
37The applicant relies on the High Court decision of Cesan v The Queen; Mas Rivadavia v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358 (""Cesan"") in support of this application. The High Court decided Cesan on the basis of whether there had been a miscarriage of justice according to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The test under s 79(2) is less demanding than that under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act:  The Application of Raymond Grant Pedrana [2000] NSWSC 970; 17 A Crim R 459, but the matters taken into account by the High Court in Cesan have a bearing on this application: see, for example, The Application of Robert Minniti [2011] NSWSC 835 at [54].
38Cesan overturned the majority decision in Cesan v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth); Max Rivadavia v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 273; 174 A Crim R 385.  The evidence before the Court of Criminal Appeal was that the judge was asleep on a number of occasions on the 11 days when evidence was being given; he slept at least once on most of those days and on some days on two or three occasions; some of the sleep episodes, possibly between two and five, lasted from 10 to 15 minutes - most lasted between two and 10 minutes; the judge's sleeping was accompanied by heavy breathing on a number of occasions and he snored when the accused was giving evidence - this was disruptive and caused him to look around at the trial judge; the jury was distracted by the judge's sleep episodes; and some of the jury members found his behaviour amusing and even emulated it: Cesan at [94].
39French CJ in found that:
""[93] If, by reason of sleep episodes or serious inattention, the reality or the appearance exists that a trial judge has substantially failed to discharge his or her duty of supervision and control of the trial process in a trial by jury, then enough has been made out to establish a miscarriage of justice. The question whether there has been the reality or appearance of a substantial failure by the judge to perform his or her duty will require assessment of a number of factors including: 1. Whether the conduct of the judge can be said to have affected the outcome of the trial. 2. Whether the conduct of the judge has created a risk that the outcome of the trial may have been affected. 3. Whether counsel raised the question of the trial judge's conduct at the trial. 4. Whether the jury appeared to have noticed or to have been distracted or otherwise affected by the judge's conduct. None of these factors, taken by itself, is determinative. There is an overall assessment to be made in deciding whether a failure or apparent failure by the judge for whatever reason to attend to the duty of supervising and controlling the trial process amounts to a miscarriage of justice. In so saying it should be emphasised that the duty of counsel in a case of non-trivial inattention or sleep episodes is to draw these issues to the attention of the judge in the absence of the jury. The failure of counsel to do so may support an inference that the judge's conduct did not amount to a substantial failure in the judicial process at trial. However, it will not always be determinative.""
40French CJ concluded that there was a miscarriage of justice by failure of the judicial process. The judge failed to maintain the necessary supervision and control of the trial, and his conduct created a distraction during the trial process. In particular it distracted the jury and led at least some of the members of the jury to regard the judge with amusement: at [96].
41Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ held:
""[119] What is important in these cases, is that the jury was distracted from paying attention to all of the evidence.  And it was upon the assessment of all of the evidence led at trial that the jury's verdict had to be founded.  The repeated distraction of the jury from attending to the evidence at various stages of the trial, including when one of the accused was giving his evidence, constituted a miscarriage of justice.""
42Gummow J expressed the same conclusion, based upon the distraction of the jury from paying attention to all of the evidence (at [105]).  Heydon J agreed with Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ (at [133]).  
Consideration
43The contention that grounds 5 and 7 in the applicant's appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal should be re-considered in light of the evidence that Dodd DCJ was sleeping for portions of the trial may be put aside immediately. The amended fifth ground, that the trial judge erred in failing to discharge the jury as a result of ""persistent, improper questioning by the Crown Prosecutor causing an outburst from Mr Roberti in which he made admissions as to his criminal antecedents and the antecedents of fellow co-accused"" was dealt with on appeal at [76]-[89].
""[76] Roberti was being cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor on his and Bateman's use of names other than their own. The suggestion was that by doing so they were trying to reduce the chances of being identified as actors in a criminal enterprise. There had been evidence that Bateman had travelled on a passport in Roberti's name, and that Roberti had used passports provided by Bateman in the names of Russell and Simmons. Then there were these questions and answers (T 4277-8) - Q. Did you hear him at any time on that trip being addressed as Mr Hendrie rather than Mr Roberti?A. No. You've got me on trial for my past here, we've all got criminal records--Q. Mr Roberti--A. --and been in gaol and Mr Bateman has made a fool out of all of us including you and mainly myself and your policemen.Q. Mr Roberti--A. And he's got your policemen to lie to a judge for you. Q. Mr Roberti stay calm?A. Stay - how can I stay calm. He's judging me - he's trialing me on my bloody - on my past and he's leading the jury wrong--Q. Mr Roberti--A. --he's leading them that I'm on--Q. Please Mr Roberti--A. How can I, I'm not being - he's misleading the jury.
[77] The trial judge immediately sent the jury out and a debate ensued. His Honour recalled the jury and warned them in these terms- Members of the jury you heard some time ago a fairly emotional outburst from Mr Roberti in the witness box. I am striking out all what he said in that emotional outburst. You are not to hold anything that he said in that outburst against him. You are to remove completely from your mind anything that you heard him say or thought you heard him say we all from time to time give vent to our emotions and sometimes in doing so say things that are wrong and that we know later when we think about it we shouldn't have said and that we regret saying. And in this case this has been an emotional outburst from Mr Roberti. It's a difficult task being in the witness box for several days, subject to questioning. Difficult for anyone. I am going to adjourn the trial so far as today is concerned in fairness to Mr Roberti, to allow himself to calm down and recompose himself, so he can return to give evidence in the witness box again.In one particular respect I'll refer to the particular words that he used because they were totally wrong in fact and at one stage he said ""we've all got criminal records and been in gaol"" and that is totally wrong in fact. You are to completely ignore that as well as the rest of what Mr Roberti said. You are to completely remove it from your minds and pay no attention to it, so far as the trial is concerned. 
[78] His Honour sent the jury home until the following day. Counsel for Bartle and other accused applied for an order discharging the jury. His Honour refused to do so. ...[80] This ground of appeal asserts an error on the part of the trial judge in refusing to discharge the jury and a resulting miscarriage of justice. Roberti's answers were unresponsive and the evidence inadmissible. There was a risk that the jury would misuse the evidence. It was the duty of the trial judge to remove the risk or, if that could not be done, to discharge the jury. The criterion for the exercise of the discretion was the maintenance of the fairness of the trial. The test for the discharge of the jury was one of necessity: Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 440. 
[81] In exercising his discretion the trial judge could take into account all that had happened and all that was likely thereafter to happen. In giving judgment refusing to discharge the jury his Honour said this ... - However, I am still faced with the situation where the outburst occurred and I must decide whether in the circumstances any prejudice caused to his own case by Mr Roberti should entail the result that I discharge the jury as far as his case is concerned.I have dealt so far with the prejudicial material by striking out the passage and by telling the jury that they are to completely ignore it and by telling them that what he said was in fact wrong. I have attempted to soften the impact of that so far as Mr Roberti's case is concerned by attempting to place those comments in the context of it being an emotional outburst. I put it to the jury that people when they are upset and emotional frequently giving vent to feelings and express matters which they later regret, which they know to be wrong, and which they wish they had never said.Whether that ultimately has the effect intended or not, so far as the jury is concerned, must be obviously a matter of some conjecture, but I would think that in general terms the members of the jury are prepared to accept that kind of an explanation and in particular, in my view, a jury is likely to follow the instruction to ignore what was said in terms of paying no heed to it in their consideration of the case....Mr Whitehead (trial counsel for Thompson), he has basically adopted the submissions of Mr Paish (trial counsel for Fry). Obviously he does not have the same factual basis for his application. For the same general reasons as I have given in respect of the other applications and in particular for those reasons relating to the application of Mr Spencer for Mr Roberti I refuse the application for discharge so far as Mr Thompson is concerned. For those same general reasons I also refuse the application for discharge made by Mr Simpson on behalf of Mr Bartle. 
[82] His Honour was correct in observing that a jury is generally likely to follow an instruction to ignore evidence which has been struck out. The experience of the Courts is that reliance on the integrity and sense of duty of jurors is not misplaced: The Queen v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 per Dawson J at 614-5. 
[83] Speaking in a different context about the expectation of the Courts that juries will obey the directions they are given, McHugh J said this in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15 at 31- 
The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one - accused, trial judge or member of the public - could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves a jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.
[84] The submission on appeal that his Honour erred in his discretion or, alternatively, that the resulting trial miscarried rests upon a single proposition, namely that the evidence was of such a nature that the jury would have found themselves unable to comply with the direction to put it out of their minds. Putting aside for the moment the question whether the jury would have understood the words ""totally wrong"" to mean anything other than ""wrong"", the jury knew as soon as he said the words that Roberti's evidence was not completely correct. ...
[85] ... [T]he jury knew that one accused had committed some serious criminal offences and had been to prison on at least one occasion and that another had committed no offences and had not been to prison. 
[86] The jury knew about some less serious criminal activity on the part of other accused, for example McCaffrey's association with LSD, marijuana and ecstasy, but there was no other evidence that any accused other than Diez had been involved in criminal activity anything like as serious as that charged. 
[87] We do not think that these circumstances lead to the conclusion that the jury would have been unable to put out of their minds the things Roberti had said. ...
[88] Moreover, the outburst, though no doubt intense, was short. It was followed quite soon by a firm direction that the jury put it out of their minds. The trial judge told the jury that what Roberti had said was wrong (for that is what we think the jury would have understood by the direction), and they knew that it was wrong. The trial lasted some seven months. The incident complained of happened on 4 July and more than two months elapsed between then and the delivery of the verdicts on 13 September. We do not think in the circumstances that the trial turned out unfairly for Bartle so that he lost a reasonable chance of acquittal. 
[89] We do not think that the discretion of the trial judge in refusing to discharge the jury miscarried. We do not think that the resulting trial miscarried. We do not think that this ground of appeal has been made good.
44Whether or not the applicant's ""outburst"" was caused by the judge failing to ""supervise the cross-examiner in circumstances where defence counsel has unsuccessfully objected on numerous occasions during the course of the cross-examination"" is irrelevant and, furthermore, not supported by the evidence. The Court was concerned with the effect of the outburst, not its cause. Furthermore, the transcript clearly shows that the trial judge immediately intervened when the outburst began (T4277.52) and had intervened three pages earlier where his Honour corrected the applicant's description of the place he had travelled to from the United States (T4274.36). That the outburst was occasioned by observing the trial judge was sleeping is also inconsistent with Mr Roberti's counsel's statement made in the absence of the jury just after the outburst that: ""He is in a state where a similar outburst could occur at any moment. I'm told he's not getting his medication, he's getting some psychiatric intervention at the gaol"" (T4279.30). 
45It is similarly not apparent how the purported failure of supervision bears on ground 7. The Court of Criminal Appeal dealt with this ground at [311]-[314]. There is nothing in the evidence now before me that affects their Honours' reasoning.
46The broader question is whether considering the matter leads to sense of unease or disquiet in allowing the conviction to stand. It does not.
47The transcript shows relevant and regular interventions by the trial judge on almost every day of the eight-month trial. The applicant specifies 12 portions of the transcript during which he contends that the judge was sleeping, but this was done over 10 years after the conclusion of the trial. The applicant has shown that he previously sought to rely on this point as a ground of appeal and so to some extent is not responsible for the delay. But it is difficult to conceive that such a purported recollection of precise points in the trial when the judge was asleep, extending to reference to specific transcript pages, and sometimes to line numbers on pages, could be at all reliable without corroborating evidence. 
48There is nothing in the transcript itself that supports the claim that the judge was sleeping at the specific times asserted. At every reference point in the applicant's affidavit the transcript reveals that the trial judge responds coherently and as would be expected. The trial judge responds in each instance in various ways: with a caution to the jury; an adjournment for the day or for a break; an instruction for the jury to leave in order to discuss matters with counsel in their absence; upholding or disallowing an objection; and with questions to the applicant regarding the evidence being given. A specific example of this is referred to above, namely in the lead up to the outburst where the judge corrected the applicant's description of the place he had travelled to from the United States. 
49The applicant's affidavit includes that ""by the middle stages of the trial the jury were themselves nodding off whenever the Judge was asleep"".  That is the extent of his assertion as to the jury being distracted.  It may be accepted that were occasions when the judge did fall asleep; after all, it was accepted to be the case in Cesan where it was noted (at [112]) that he had been diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnoea.  But I cannot accept that one or more jurors were asleep in a courtroom full of lawyers and no-one said anything about it.
50The affidavit of Mr Spencer generally supports the applicant's claim that the trial judge was asleep at various points in the trial, but the assertions contained therein are understandably imprecise, given the length of time that had elapsed between the trial and the swearing of the affidavit. In particular, it makes no reference to when the judge was allegedly sleeping, such as during the cross-examination of the applicant or otherwise. Furthermore, Mr Spencer was unable to provide specific details about how the jury reacted or responded to the judge being asleep ""as the trial took place such a long time ago"".  The most he could provide is that members of the jury would look in the judge's direction when he was asleep.  But whether they were distracted more than momentarily (and therefore insignificantly) is beyond Mr Spencer's recollection.
51There is nothing in the affidavit evidence that suggests that the trial judge failed to adequately supervise and control the trial, or that his conduct created any significant distraction during the trial process. This conclusion is fortified by the fact that neither the Crown Prosecutor nor the many defence counsel raised a question about the issue during the very lengthy trial.
52The case against the applicant was a strong one and works against producing a sense of unease or disquiet in allowing the conviction to stand. The defence case was that Mr Roberti had no idea that there was a plan to import cocaine into Australia until the cocaine in question was loaded on to the Bora Bora II. He claimed that he did not intend to join or assist the criminal enterprise and wished to get off the boat as soon as possible after coming to suspect that the packages contained illegal drugs. 
53The applicant's activities leading up to arrest were strongly supportive of the Crown case. He was using a false passport (Bartle at [284]) and gave the police a false name when arrested (at [286]). He knew of Bateman's criminal history (T4234) and knew that Bateman purchased the yacht in the name of Thompson (T4391). He referred to the Ngaire Wha in coded terms (as a ""car"" - T4491) and spoke to Bateman by phone from the Ngaire Wha after he had apparently learnt that the packages contained cocaine in a relaxed and jovial manner (T4525-6). 
Conclusion
54Evidence that a judge may have slept for portions of a trial on its own does not lead to a conclusion that there was a miscarriage of justice.  The focus should be upon a question whether there was some departure from the proper conduct of the trial, rather than the cause of any departure:  Cesan at [112], [119] (Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ).  
55In Cesan there was clear evidence of the jury being distracted from paying attention to the evidence.  In the present case there are bald assertions of distraction but nothing remotely definitive.  The conclusion I have reached is consistent with the determination of a similar application by Latham J in The Application of Robert Minniti [2011] NSWSC 835.  Her Honour concluded: 
""[75] Accepting for the purposes of the application that there may have been occasions when the judge appeared to sleep, or did 'nod off' for short periods of time, there is no sound basis for concluding that the jury was distracted or otherwise affected by the judge's conduct, in the sense explained by the High Court in Cesan. None of the material suggests that the jury failed to perform their task of paying attention to the evidence in the trial because they were distracted by the judge's behaviour. It is said that some members of the jury appeared to 'nod off' or 'nap' or sleep from time to time, but episodes of fatigue and momentary inattention in the course of a trial among members of a jury are within 'the margin of appreciation for human limitations'. There has not been shown to be any compelling connection between the judge's conduct and the behaviour of certain members of the jury, such as was demonstrated in Cesan.""
56The evidence has not produced a doubt or question as to the applicant's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case. The application must be refused.

2763998,R v Shahrouk [2014] NSWCCA 87,"Judgment

1HALL J: I agree with the reasons of Davies J. 

2R A HULME J: I also agree with the reasons of Davies J.

3DAVIES J: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) following the failure of the Respondent to provide promised assistance to the authorities.

4At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal on 1 May 2014 the Court made the following orders with reasons to follow at a later time:

1. The Crown appeal is allowed.

2. The sentence imposed in the District Court on 16 December 2011 and corrected on 19 October 2012 is quashed.

3. The Respondent is sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of four years seven months with a non-parole period of two years eight months commencing 16 December 2011. 

4. The Respondent will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 15 August 2014. The total term of the sentence expires on 15 July 2016.

5. Pursuant to s 53A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) the individual sentences that would otherwise have been imposed are:

(a) in respect of the offence of destroy property by fire whilst in company and taking into account the offence on the Form 1, imprisonment for a term of three years six months, and 

(b) in respect of the offence detaining a person with the intention of obtaining an advantage whilst in company, imprisonment for two years. 

5These are my reasons for joining in those orders. 

The background

6The Respondent was charged with two offences as follows:

Count 1: Destroying property in company by fire. The maximum penalty is 11 years imprisonment and there is no standard non-parole period;

Count 2: Aggravated detain for advantage. The maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment with no standard non-parole period.

7The Respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 25 August 2011. He was sentenced by Judge Cogswell SC in the District Court on 16 December 2011. He asked for a further offence of conveying false information to cause fear for safety to be taken into account on a form 1. 

8The Agreed Statement of Facts before the Sentencing Judge included the following information.

9The property destroyed by fire was a building containing an Indian restaurant called the Copper Tiffin Restaurant in Cleveland Street, Redfern. The owner of the business was a company under the control of a person known as Yash Desai. The restaurant appears not to have been successful and by the time of the fire there were amounts owing to a number of creditors including the landlord and utility companies. 

10By May 2010 Mr Desai was involved in discussions to sell the restaurant. 

11On 25 June 2010 at about 7:30pm a waitress in the restaurant answered the telephone and was told that there was a bomb at the restaurant which would explode in ten minutes. Investigations established that it was the Respondent who made the bomb threat. That formed the basis of the offence on the form 1. 

12Mr Desai wanted the business burnt down for his own reasons, presumably because of the debts owed, and because he had taken out an insurance policy that covered fire and peril. The facts before Judge Cogswell disclose that Desai made contact with the Respondent and agreed that he would, with the assistance of another person, burn the restaurant down. The Respondent was to be paid $10,000 for doing so. 

13The Respondent was given a key to the restaurant by Mr Desai and informed that it was closed on Mondays. 

14At about 11:40pm on Monday, 5 July 2010 the Respondent and his co-offender let themselves into the restaurant and commenced to pour flammable material around and to stack furniture. A man who lived above the restaurant noticed something strange, went down into the restaurant and asked who was there. When he was seen by the Respondent and the co-offender he was told aggressively to sit on a chair. He complied. He was required to hand over his mobile phone where the SIM card was extracted. He was threatened not to move. The Respondent and co-offender continued pouring flammable liquid around the premises. At one point, when they were distracted, the man escaped and asked someone to call the police.

15The Respondent and the co-offender lit the flammable liquid. That initially resulted in an explosion, and thereafter the fire spread and intensified. There were three people living upstairs who had to escape by getting onto an awning. By chance, two men were driving by with a ladder and they helped those people down. The police and fire brigade arrived and the fire was brought under control.

16The restaurant itself along with two buildings beside it were severely damaged. The total cost was estimated to amount to $400,000. The contents of the restaurant were totally destroyed and their estimated value was about $100,000. 

The assistance given

17On 9 October 2010 the Respondent was arrested and charged. He pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and was accorded a discount of 25% for the utility of that plea. 

18The Respondent first offered assistance to authorities almost a year later on 28 September 2011. He provided a statement dated 28 September 2011 which implicated Mr Desai (therein referred to as Yash Desel) in the arrangement to burn down the restaurant. 

19This statement was in evidence before Judge Cogswell for the sentence proceedings. At those sentence proceedings the Respondent gave evidence to his own counsel as follows:

Q. Mr Shahrouk, I'm just going to ask you about a document that you signed this morning. I'm not going to talk any great length about that, I think my friend might just have a question or two to ask you about that. 
A. Yes.

Q. But you understand that you have given an undertaking to the Court that if required at a certain stage you would give evidence in a certain way. You understand that? 
A. I do understand.

Q. You understand the implications to you or the effect upon you if you don't give that evidence if asked to down the track? 
A. I understand that, sir.

20In cross-examination by the Crown he gave the following evidence:

Q. Mr Drewett asked you about an undertaking. I've got some further questions about that document you signed this morning. Now do you understand his Honour today may give you an additional discount for the undertaking that you've signed? 
A. I understand.

Q. Do you understand that part of that is because you're promising to give evidence against a particular person in this matter - in another matter I should say? 
A. I understand.

Q. Do you understand if you don't give evidence in accordance with your undertaking and the statement attached to your undertaking, do you appreciate that you may be re-sentenced and your sentence may be increased as a result?
A. I understand that too.

21In his Remarks on Sentence Judge Cogswell said:

[32] The assistance has been promised and has not yet been delivered because there has been no opportunity for that. I regard the assistance as significant but limited by its timeliness and I propose to allow a combined discount of 35 per cent, for both the plea of guilty and for the assistance. Of the additional 10 per cent which I have allowed for assistance, I would attribute 7 per cent to assistance which will be provided in the future. In other words, of the total discount of 35 per cent, 7 per cent of that is attributable to the assistance which will be provided by Mr Shahrouk if required. 

22Judge Cogswell then sentenced the Respondent as follows:

In respect of the crime of aggravated arson a sentence of three years imprisonment commencing 16 December 2011 and expiring 15 December 2014;

For the kidnapping offence a sentence of one year and ten months imprisonment commencing 15 February 2014 and expiring 15 December 2015. 

The overall sentence was four years with a single non-parole period of two years and four months commencing 16 December 2011 and expiring 15 April 2014.

23The sentence was amended in form, although not in substance, on 19 October 2012 to make clear that an aggregate sentence had been imposed. Per s 53A(2)(B) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) his Honour specified the sentences that would have been imposed, as indicated above.

The assistance is withdrawn

24On 13 March 2014 Mr Desai and the Respondent's co-offender were due to stand trial before Judge Hoy SC and a jury. The principal evidence against Mr Desai was the statement made by the Respondent on 28 September 2011. Before the trial commenced information was received that the Respondent did not intend to give evidence in accordance with the statement. A voir dire was conducted prior to the jury being empanelled. The Crown prosecutor asked:

Mr Shahrouk, are you still willing to give evidence against Mr Desai in this matter in accordance with what you wrote in that statement?

25The Respondent answered ""No"". He was asked why and he said that ""this false statement isn't true"". 
26He was then taken through the statement where he indicated the truth or falsity of each paragraph in the statement. In substance, all paragraphs in the statement that related to Mr Desai were said to be untrue. 

27The result was that the trial of Mr Desai was adjourned. Subsequently, the DPP directed no further proceedings against Mr Desai.

28In these circumstances the ordinary rule is that, if an appeal is brought by the Crown, the sentence will be increased. In R v KS [2005] NSWCCA 87 Wood CJ at CL said at [19]:

The ability of the Crown to invoke this section is a very important part of the criminal justice system. Persons who give undertakings and who receive the benefit of those undertakings by way of a discounted sentence can, subject to exceptional circumstances, expect to have their sentences increased if they renege on their undertaking to give evidence. The departure from an undertaking of that kind is not to be regarded lightly and it will normally justify appellate intervention.

See also the summary of various authorities undertaken by James J (with whom Rothman and Harrison JJ agreed) in R v Douar [2007] NSWCCA 123 at [29]. 

29In the present case, two matters arise for consideration. First, should the residual discretion associated with Crown appeals be exercised to dismiss the appeal? Secondly, if the appeal is allowed, should the adjustment to the sentence be confined to the discount allowed for future assistance?

The residual discretion

30The residual discretion might arise because of threats made against the person. However, threats are likely to be a consideration taken into account when leniency is extended in the first instance: R v Hammond [2001] NSWCCA 34; (2001) 121 A Crim R 1 at [17] and [20].

31Ms Burgess of counsel for the Respondent drew attention to an affidavit of her instructing solicitor which tended to show that for a period of about six days the Respondent had been placed in the same correctional facility as Mr Desai and had been transported to Court in the same prison van on 10 March 2014. This evidence was said to give rise to the inference that the true reason for the Respondent's refusal to testify in accordance with his statement was a fear of threat and/or intimidation by or on behalf of Mr Desai. 

32Reference was made to what was said by Studdert J (with whom Wood J and Newman J agreed) in R v Bagnall; R v Russell (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 10 June 1994, unrep) at page 6:

It is a matter for the gravest concern for instance that the Respondent Russell should have been placed in the same cell and transported in the same van as W immediately before being called upon to give evidence. This simply should not have been allowed to happen. 

...

Under no circumstances should such a witness be permitted to travel in the same van to the place of trial as that other offender nor should he be kept in the same cell as that other offender. The need for the witness in such circumstances to be protected from the influence of other prisoners must be recognised so far as is practicable. 

33In that case there was evidence that considerable pressure was brought to bear upon the offenders and that threats had been made against them not to give the evidence they had undertaken to give. The evidence was regarded as sufficient to justify refusing the Crown appeal.

34In R v KS [2005] NSWCCA 87 the Respondent refused to give evidence despite having undertaken to do so, because he had been transported in the same prison van and held in the same holding cell as the person against whom he was to give evidence. Although he was not actually threatened, he had received messages whilst in prison trying to persuade him not to give the evidence he had undertaken to give. Wood CJ at CL (with whom Tobias JA and Buddin J agreed) said:

[27] However, it seems to me that the case must be viewed against the reality of the position in which a potential witness, who is in custody finds himself if he is placed in the immediate vicinity of the accused. In circumstances such as that it seems to me that very little needs to be said by way of express threat.

[28] The implicit presence of a threat is obvious and the potential witness is in a situation where he has no control over his immediate safety, it being a matter which, so far as he can see, has not been properly addressed by those who are his immediate custodians. In those circumstances it appears to me that it would be entirely understandable if the Respondent felt under a considerable degree of pressure such that he might well wish to renege from the undertaking.

35The attempt in that case to persuade the offender not to give the evidence when taken with other matters, including the fact that any adjustment with the sentence would amount only to tinkering, was enough for the Court to refuse the Crown appeal.

36The evidence in the present case discloses that the Respondent and Mr Desai were transported to the Court in the same prison van on 10 March 2014. The following day a non-association order was placed on Mr Desai in respect of the Respondent. On that day and on 13 March they were transported to the Court in separate vehicles. Despite the fact that they were both housed within the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre from 26 February 2014 to 4 March 2014 and were both housed in G Block, they were nonetheless in separate pods. Evidence also disclosed that this was Mr Desai's first time in custody. 

37There was no evidence that threats or intimidation had been made by Mr Desai towards the Respondent. The Respondent denied that his change of mind had anything to do with his present custody arrangements. Nor did he suggest that he had been threatened in any way. His sole basis for withdrawing his assistance was said to be because the statement was false. 

38The only evidence before this Court was the sworn evidence given by the Respondent before Judge Hoy. The Respondent did not swear or rely upon any evidence before this Court. There is, therefore, no basis for the Court to infer that the reason the Respondent withdrew his assistance was other than for the reason he stated before Judge Hoy. 

39In R v DV [2005] NSWCCA 319 this Court considered it appropriate to apply the residual discretion to disallow the appeal. This was because the Respondent's head sentence was due to expire within approximately two months, his non-parole period had expired some three months earlier and because there had been an unusually long delay in the matter coming to trial in which he was to give the evidence, a matter for which he was not responsible. 

40In the present case, although the Respondent's non-parole period has very recently expired, his overall sentence is not due to expire until 15 December 2015. There is no suggestion of any undue delay in Mr Desai's matter coming to trial although the first trial date was vacated. 

41I do not consider that there is any basis for applying the residual discretion. 

Adjustment of the sentence

42There is some tension in the authorities about whether the sentence should be adjusted only to reflect the discount given for future assistance or whether the whole of the discount can be reconsidered.

43Section 5DA(2) provides:

On an appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal may, if it is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as it thinks fit.

44Despite the apparent width of the discretion in the subsection the authorities speak with one voice in holding that the discretion is not at large. It is concerned only with the discount that was given. 

45In R v Chaaban [2006] NSWCCA 352 the Crown pointed to the width of the subsection to argue that reconsideration should be given to the matter of the offender's contrition and his genuineness regarding rehabilitation. 

46Basten JA, in rejecting the Crown's submission, said at [5]:

More broadly, it may be thought inappropriate to allow the Director, on an appeal under s 5DA, to reopen other aspects of the sentence calculation where the sentencing judge has sought to isolate and specify the amount of the reduction given on account of the undertaking. However, because there are a range of circumstances in which s 5DA may be engaged and a range of ways in which a sentencing judge may indicate how a promise to provide further assistance has been taken into account, I do not think it is appropriate to set down any general rule in the circumstances of the present case, where the issue may be dealt with on a narrow factual basis.


47Hidden J said at [22] that the Crown's approach was inconsistent with what had been said in R v O'Brien (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 10 June 1993, unrep) and R v El-Sayed [2003] NSWCCA 232; (2003) 57 NSWLR 659.

48In O'Brien Gleeson CJ (with whom Sheller JA and Newman J agreed) said (at p 2):

The purpose of s 5DA is not punitive. The purpose is to enable this court in an appropriate case, and to an appropriate extent, to intervene to adjust or correct a sentence where the sentencing process can be seen, with the benefit of hindsight, to have miscarried by reason of the circumstances set out in the section. 

49In El-Sayed Simpson J (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Adams J agreed) said at [29] that the purpose of s 5DA is:

merely to restore the offender to the position that would have pertained had the dishonoured undertaking not been given.

50Bell J in Chaaban said at [52]:

In the event that the contemplated assistance is not given, s 5DA provides a mechanism that allows the discount to be excised. It does not admit of reviewing the sentence generally.

51Although the Court in Chaaban made it clear that s 5DA did not permit a review of the whole sentence, neither did they confine the review to the specific discount for the future assistance. That was consistent with some earlier cases which had taken a similar view.

52In R v Burton (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 6 August 1997, unrep) the offender, a heroin dealer, had been given a discount of one third from the sentence that she would otherwise have received. This discount was given by reason of a statement that she had made to police and an undertaking to give evidence against other suppliers. When she was called to give evidence at a committal hearing she declined to give the evidence promised, said that she had lied in her statement, and did not remember signing it. The Court increased the sentence by the amount it had been discounted without any distinction being made between past and future assistance.

53In R v Hocking [2000] NSWCCA 339 the offender made a statement to police about a co-offender's involvement in a robbery. He undertook to give evidence in accordance with that statement. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years with an additional term of 1 year. The sentencing judge said that he would have imposed a considerably heavier sentence had it not been for the assistance given and promised, although he said he would not quantify the assistance.
54The offender later refused to give the evidence at the co-offender's trial. This Court increased the sentence by 25%. Ireland J (with whom Beazley JA and Smart AJ agreed) said:

[36] The enactment of s 442B of the Crimes Act, 1900, and its successor, s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999, has provided an important tool in the administration of justice. This Court should be vigilant to ensure the imposition of a sentence which, so far as possible, excises the discount which the respondent received.

[37] In the present case, there is an element of discount related to past assistance given by the respondent which I assume to be the identification of the assailants. However, even this assistance is valueless when the respondent fails to give his evidence as promised.

55Hocking was followed with approval in R v KS [2005] NSWCCA 87 at [20].

56In R v Hammond the offender gave evidence at his sentencing hearing nominating his uncle as having been party to a number of the offences involving the offender. He undertook to give that evidence on behalf of the Crown. The sentencing judge reduced the sentence he would otherwise have imposed by 18 months. When the offender later declined to give the evidence an appeal was brought to his Court. Bell J (with whom Giles JA and Hulme J agreed) said at [28] that it was appropriate to increase the sentence by the amount of the reduction given by the sentencing judge. No distinction was made between past and future assistance.

57On the other hand in R v Waqa [2004] NSWCCA 405; (2004) 149 A Crim R 143 Dunford J (with whom Simpson & Hidden JJ) agreed said at [26]:

...[W]here a discount has been allowed for the provision of past assistance, and an undertaking to provide future assistance and there is subsequently a breach of the undertaking to provide future assistance, this Court can adjust the sentence on account of the breach of that undertaking, but cannot interfere with that part of the reduction that has been allowed on account of the past assistance.

No authority for the proviso was given. Nor is the statement consistent with the earlier authorities to which I have referred. That extract from Waqa was quoted with apparent approval in Douar at [29].

58Ms Burgess submitted that the approach taken in Burton, Hocking and Hammond are distinguishable because they were all decided before the 2010 amendments to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The amendments now require the court to specify the discount given for each of past and future assistance.

59Nonetheless, an examination of those and other cases decided before the 2010 amendments demonstrates that consideration was actually given to the distinction between past and future assistance despite there being no statutory requirement as appears in s 23 (4): Burton at p 3 ; Hocking at [37]; R v DV [2005] NSWCCA 319 at [1]. Further, in R v GD [2013] NSWCCA 212, one of the first decisions of this Court to consider a s 5DA appeal after the 2010 amendments commenced operation, Button J (with whom Leeming JA and RA Julme J agreed) said at [41]:

Turning to past assistance, it is true that, with the benefit of hindsight, it appears that that assistance was very likely worthless, in light of subsequent events that destroyed the credibility of the respondent. And it is clear from the terms of s 5DA(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act, that, if an appeal pursuant to the section is upheld, this Court is not limited merely to reapplying the discount that was given for an unfulfilled promise with regard to future assistance. This Court many resentence ""as it thinks fit"". That state of affairs argues for this Court applying no discount for past assistance, since it could be said that the subsequent behaviour of the respondent has shown the true value of the assistance given before the imposition of sentence.

60The facts in Waqa were somewhat different from the position in the present case. In Waqa it was only during the sentencing proceedings that the offender offered the assistance and signed an undertaking to give evidence against a co-offender who had already been charged. Subsequently, the police obtained a statement from him setting out the co-offender's role in the robberies in respect of which they were both charged: see at [7] - [8].

61By contrast, in the present case it was only because of what the Respondent told the police that Mr Desai was charged and brought to trial. When the respondent declined to give the evidence against Mr Desai, claiming it was lies, the whole case against Mr Desai collapsed and the DPP decided not to proceed.

62It is not the role of this Court on an appeal under s 5DA to determine whether the respondent was telling the truth when he provided the information to the police that led to the charging of Mr Desai or when he recanted and said the information was lies (R v Walters (1994) 33 NSWLR 612 at 616 per Gleeson CJ). However, it is clear, in the events which have happened, that the whole of the assistance provided by the Respondent was of no value.

63In Walters Gleeson CJ said (at p 616):

The purpose of the section is to enable the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentencing process with the benefit of hindsight, and if it is minded so to do in the exercise of its discretion, to alter the sentence to take account of certain events that have occurred since sentencing and that falsify the basis on which the sentences were imposed.

64The basis on which the sentence was imposed here was that the Respondent had identified Mr Desai as the person who engaged him to destroy the premises. The Respondent made a statement to that effect, and undertook to give evidence in accordance with that statement. The events of 13 March 2014 falsified the entire basis on which the sentence was imposed. It may well also be the case that some of the material in the Agreed Statement of Facts before the Sentencing Judge (e.g. what appears in [9], [12] and [13] above) derived from information provided by the Respondent. The Respondent should be re-sentenced on the basis of no discount at all for assistance.
Re-sentence

65The approach to re-sentencing should follow the method employed by Button J in R v GD at [50] to [52]. First, remove the 35% discount from the head sentence of 4 years, arriving at a starting point of 6 years 1 month. Secondly, apply a 25% discount for the early plea. Rounding down, the discounted head sentence will then be a head sentence of 4 years 7 months. Thirdly, maintaining the ratio of 58.33% fixed by the Sentencing Judge, the non-parole period is 2 years 8 months. The respondent will be due for release on parole on 15 August 2014 and the total term of the sentence expires on 15 July 2016.

2764021,R v Anning [2014] NSWDC 359,"SENTENCE

VIDEO LINK COMMENCED AT 2.14PM


	
	HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Henry Alfred Anning, appears today for sentence in relation to 11 crimes for which he was found guilty by judgment of myself, sitting as a judge alone, on 18 December 2013.
	
	
	Nine of the counts were counts as pleaded in the indictment and two of the counts for sentence today are counts available as what might be called statutory alternatives. Originally there were 14 counts in the indictment.
	
	
	The background to the matter I will outline later when I turn to certain sentences imposed by Acting Judge McGuire by way of limiting terms after a special hearing that was concluded in July 2009.
	
	
	The prisoner is for sentence in relation to two counts of what might shortly be called “buggery” contrary to s 79 Crimes Act 1900. Each of those counts carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period for that offence or any of the offences for which the prisoner has been found guilty, having regard to the time at which the offences were committed.
	
	
	The third count in the indictment for sentence is an offence contrary to s 81A Crimes Act 1900. This relates to a victim FG; the buggery counts relate to the victim NG. That offence carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment.
	
	
	The fourth count for sentence is another allegation of buggery involving the victim KW and it is provided for by the same provisions relating to counts 1 and 2
	
	
	Count 5 for sentence is an offence of attempted bestiality. I am informed by the Crown, in the material provided by it, that this offence contrary to s 80 Crimes Act 1900 at the relevant time carried a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	Count 6 is an act of gross indecency with a person under the age of 18 years. The victim in that matter is DC. This is an offence contrary to s 78Q(1) Crimes Act 1900; it carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment.
	
	
	Counts 7, 9 and 10 in the indictment, but the seventh, eighth and ninth counts for sentence, are counts of homosexual intercourse with a person between the age of 10 and 18. The victim in this matter is again DC. This is an offence contrary to then s 78K Crimes Act 1900; it carries a maximum penalty in each instance of 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Count 11 in the indictment, the tenth count for sentence, is an offence of attempting homosexual intercourse with a person between the age of 10 and 18. The victim in that matter RR is deceased. The relevant statutory provision I am informed by the Crown is s 78L Crimes Act 1900. I was informed by the Crown that that carries with it a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	Count 13 in the indictment, the eleventh count for sentence, is an offence contrary to s 78Q(1) Crimes Act 1900 of act of gross indecency with a person under the age of 18. The victim in that matter is GG. That offence carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment.
	
	
	There are no other offences to be taken into account.
	
	
	The range of dates concerning the particulars in the indictment is between 30 September 1975 to 31 December 1990.
	
	
	The prisoner has been in custody as I understand it since 29 April 2009, and of course, time previously spent in custody will be taken into account as the law provides. The prisoner, it follows from what I have earlier said, was convicted of these matters, having pleaded not guilty to the charges in the indictment.
	
	
	In the judgment I gave on 18 December 2013 between paras 6 and 15 I set out factual contextual matters to the various counts in the indictment and I do not propose to repeat those matters. The basic facts or particulars in relation to count 1 are set out in para 16 of that judgment. In respect of count 2 the relevant particulars and basic facts are set out in para 17 of the judgment. In respect of count 3 in the indictment the particulars are set out in para 18. In respect of count 4 the particulars are set out in para 19 of the judgment and in relation to counts 4 and 5 there are particulars in relation to that matter in para 22. In relation to count 6 the particulars and basic facts of the allegations are set out in para 24. In relation to counts 7 and 8, although the prisoner was found not guilty of count 8, the relevant details are set out in para 25.
	
	
	The particulars and basic facts in relation to count 9 in the indictment are set out in para 26 of the findings on returning verdicts of guilty, and in relation to count 10 on the indictment, in para 27.
	
	
	The particulars and facts in relation to count 11, in respect of which, as I have earlier pointed out, the prisoner was found guilty of the alternative count, are set out in para 28 of the judgment; and so far as they may be relevant to these proceedings, the particulars in relation to count 13 in the context of the allegations in counts 12 and 14 providing some contextual material are set out in paras 32-37.
	
	
	The judgment set out a number of matters that were taken into account in determining the verdicts appropriate for each count. So far as specific consideration of the particular counts with which I am concerned now, the consideration of counts 1 and 2 are set out in paras 164 167. The consideration of count 3 is set out in paras 168 to 174. In relation to counts 4 and 5, specific consideration of those counts is set out at paras 176-179; and in relation to count 6, consideration of that count is set out in paras 180-192. With regard to consideration of count 11, the matters focusing on that particular count are set out at paras 193-195; and the general consideration of counts 12 to 14, conceding, of course, the fact that there are acquittals in relation to two of those counts, are set out in paras 196-199.
	
	
	I point out for the purposes of the record there is an error in the word processing relating to the treatment of counts 7, 9 and 10, which I will need to attend to when I revise the judgment. But in the judgment in revised form I will give references to the consideration of the matters pertinent to those particular counts.
	
	
	In respect of the victims of the crimes committed by the prisoner, I have several victim impact statements. I have a victim impact statement from DC, a victim impact statement from GG, and a victim impact statement from KW. I have read each of those victim impact statements. As was pointed out in passing, without really dwelling on it, in the course of the sentencing proceedings, there is some material within the victim impact statements that goes beyond their purpose.
	
	
	The statutory requirement for consideration of victim impact statements is set out in s 28 and s 29 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The Court is required to consider a victim impact statement made by a primary victim; the giving of a victim impact statement is discretionary, and certainly no inference can be drawn that the absence of a victim impact statement signifies that an offence has had little or no impact on a victim. I note from reading the remarks on sentence by Acting Judge McGuire that in fact one of the victims gave a victim impact statement for those proceedings but not for these proceedings. I draw no inference, obviously, adverse to that victim from that fact.
	
	
	There has been a great deal of debate about the evidentiary purpose and value of victim impact statements discussed in a range of cases, including R v Burg [2004] NSWCCA 300, particularly at [48]-[49]; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219, particularly at [25]; and Basten J of the Court of Appeal in R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269, particularly at [36]-[37].
	
	
	I am mindful, in the context of a consideration of circumstances of aggravation and the like, of the requirement of those matters to be established beyond reasonable doubt. I am mindful of the comments that have been made about the character of victim impact statements in circumstances where the details within them are not tested. On the other hand, the courts have also considered the fact that opportunity to examine that material further is available to counsel for the accused.
	
	
	The effects of sexual abuse upon victims is well recognised by the judiciary and has been for a considerable period of time; in fact, in my experience, far longer than necessarily may be conceded by recent judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal. I note the observations of Spigelman CJ in DBW v R [2007] relating to the widespread understanding from the evidence available in courts of these matters, and particularly the most recent judgment that I can find discussing this matter, R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [110]. To summarise what is in that judgment; child sexual offences, as these offences essentially are, to varying degrees have profound and deleterious effects upon victims for many years, if not the whole of their lives. Sexual abuse of children will inevitably give rise to psychological damage. The absolute prohibition on sexual activity with particular categories of people at the time of the commission of particular offences is intended to protect children from the physical and psychological harm taken to be caused by premature sexual activity.
	
	
	In the context of the statutory provisions and the authorities to which I have referred, I have taken into account what has been said in these victim impact statements, and I accept that in each of the victims’ cases, including those victims who have not provided victim impact statements to the Court, there has been a profound effect upon them by the conduct of the prisoner, which I will characterise shortly.
	
	
	There are statements of anger towards the victim and effects upon wider relationships and the like which could not be doubted. The analysis by KW is a very clear exposition, and a very reasoned exposition if I may say so, of relevant matters that have affected him particularly.
	
	
	The evidence in the trial, the victim impact statements and the details of the criminal history are the primary material relied upon by the Crown by way of evidentiary material.
	
	
	So far as the prisoner’s criminal history is concerned, I firstly note that the prisoner is now 81 years of age. He was born in 1932. Of course, the offending with which I am concerned covers the period of, in reality, some time in either 1976 or early 1977, and of course the late 1980’s.
	
	
	The prisoner first appeared at court in 1964, when I would calculate him to be, on the information available to me, 32 years of age. He was convicted of stealing at what was then the Court of Petty Sessions, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment which was suspended.
	
	
	He had some driving matters of no moment in 1967. However, on 3 November 1971 he appeared at the Newcastle Quarter Sessions, as the District Court’s criminal jurisdiction was then known, and was sentenced to several terms of imprisonment, one term of five years imprisonment for an offence of breaking entering and stealing, one term of three years imprisonment for an offence of larceny, and another term of three years imprisonment which, as I understand the record, although it is not abundantly clear, was partially or wholly accumulative, with a non-parole period of two years, and 10 matters were taken into account on what was then described as a Schedule 9, what we would now call a Form 1.
	
	
	The prisoner appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. That appeal was heard in December 1971. Application for leave to appeal was confirmed. The criminal history says the sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. Whether that meant ultimately he served a term of imprisonment that comprised five years imprisonment and a non-parole period of two years, I do not know.
	
	
	As I have said, the prisoner has been in custody since April 2009. In regard to the circumstances of his custody I had a great deal of evidence before me last year, as other judges have had before them in the past - some of those judges have delivered judgments which I have read, of course - setting out the circumstances of the prisoner’s medical issues, which have impacted upon the course of these proceedings since the prisoner was charged in 2002, according to the chronology provided by the Crown to me many months ago.
	
	
	He is, as I would understand it, currently admitted to the ‘Aged Care and Rehabilitation Unit’ at the Long Bay Hospital, where he has been since 20 December 2009. The defence produced a report in this proceeding dated 7 March 2014, but of course I have to consider the other evidence available to me in relation to the matters covered in that report, particularly in respect of the at least two fitness to be tried hearings that I dealt with between April 2013 and October 2013.
	
	
	To summarise the situation, the prisoner has type II diabetes, according to the most current report, and he is on medication in the form of insulin. He suffers from atrial fibrillation, referred to as AF, a heart rhythm problem caused by an irregular heartbeat, and has had this difficulty for a long time, but has no cardiac or neurological complications from that. He takes medication to decrease the risk of stroke. He has sporadic chest pain, on one occasion this occurred when he was appearing in this Court, or was supposed to appear in this Court. There is no evidence of any myocardial infarction.
	
	
	He has extensive osteoarthritis. He has evidence of lung disease in the form of emphysema. He has substantial hearing impairment. He has gastro-oesophageal reflux disease which is controlled with medication. In custody he suffers from some form of depression that is treated by antidepressant medication. He has had prostate surgery with good result. He has some sinus problems, skin lesions. He was diagnosed with having vascular dementia almost 10 years ago, and this particular aspect of the matter was very significant in the various fitness to be tried proceedings that were litigated in front of a number of judges, including His Honour Judge McGuire. This has not undergone any significant deterioration according to the latest report in recent years. He is able to attend to his activities of daily living.
	
	
	His general short term and long term memory, orientation, attention span and concentration remain “intact”. Ability to plan, organise or make decisions can be impaired in vascular dementia, and he has demonstrated some deficits in these areas. I believe the earlier evidence is a little more extensive than what I have here, but I need not reiterate it. I will deal with its relevance to these proceedings shortly. He is described as being irritable on occasions and sometimes becomes irrational when dealing with correctional officers. At times he appears to be paranoid but he has no episodes of psychosis.
	
	
	He is described in summary as a man with multiple medical problems; these are mostly chronic; none is severe enough for him to remain in a hospital setting, but they contribute to his decreased quality of life. His biggest issue, according to Dr Simm, clinical director of the Aged Care and Rehabilitation Unit at Long Bay Hospital is his degenerative spinal disease and generalised osteoarthritis which causes pain, poor mobility, increases the risk of falls. He would need particular assistance when released to the community.
	
	
	In relation to the submissions that were made on the basis of the findings that I made and the other evidence on sentence, the Crown prepared written submissions. The Crown pointed to general sentencing principles, some of which I will deal with as I cite them from the written submissions, although I have had regard to all the submissions that have been put by the parties in writing and orally.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that the Court is to make clear what factors, if any, are to be taken into account with regard to a particular offence, and that will be self-evident from the way in which I deal with the issue of aggravating factors and the like and the varying intensity or relevance of those aggravating factors to particular charges in the indictment. I am required to have regard to the maximum penalties obviously that relate to the particular offending, and also approach the matter in the context of what has been long held authority in this State, reflected in judgments such as R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129 and the judgment (Magnuson v R ([2013] NSWCCA 50)) that was provided to me by the Crown.
	
	
	In relation to the matter, the position is best summarised in the remarks of Button J, particularly at [84]-[88] of the judgment, by reference to the general principle that, as best can be determined by a court, the sentencing of an offender must take place by regard to the sentencing practices and patterns of the time of the offending and the sentencing of those offences roughly contemporaneous to that offending.
	
	
	Of course there is said to be a difficulty with historical sexual offending by reason of the fact that sometimes a pattern may not emerge. In Magnuson, in the particular facts of that case, which are very different from the facts of this case in a range of ways which I need not go into although to some extent I thought the Crown relied upon it for some comparative sentencing purposes, the sentencing pattern was clearly identifiable and his Honour went through what he regarded as five considerations.
	
	
	I have not been favoured particularly with statistics, but I have been favoured with a range of authorities in schedules prepared, for example, by the ‘Public Defenders’ Office’ dealing with judgments primarily of the Court of Criminal Appeal reflecting upon appropriate sentences for offences of the type with which I am concerned over the period of time that the offender Mr Anning was committing the offences
	
	
	In this regard I have particularly noted the decision of MJR; I have had regard to the decision of Moon [2000] NSWCCA 434 and a number of the decisions set out in the various schedules. The Crown’s summary, which is identified as the “Public Defenders’” survey of sentences for homosexual intercourse with a male aged between 10 to 18 years and, secondly, indecent assault/buggery over a particular period of time, 1970-1980, contain quite a number of cases, which I have had the opportunity to consider. I do not propose to put those matters on the record as it is unnecessary.
	
	
	With regard to the matters further raised by the learned Crown, clearly the Crown’s submissions properly point to the need for general and personal deterrence for offences of the type with which I am concerned, and this is undoubtedly true in respect of the sentencing of offenders for sexual offences committed against young people.
	
	
	I am required to take into account, of course, the damage done and the emotional harm caused to the victims, and of course the primacy given to general deterrence in this sentencing exercise. To this extent I note in passing, obviously since many of the relevant decisions covering the period with which I am concerned here pre-date 2001, the operation in clear terms of s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the varying purposes of sentencing therein contained, particularly attention to the purpose of general deterrence, personal deterrence, denunciation, adequate punishment and making the prisoner accountable for his conduct.
	
	
	Of course I am required to promote the rehabilitation of the prisoner but it might be fairly said at his age and in the circumstances of the facts of this case, that matter as a purpose of sentencing is not of particular primacy.
	
	
	It was said by the High Court in Veen (No 2) v R in 1988, of course, that the four purposes of sentencing identified by the majority in that case - there are now seven or eight including the four identified by the High Court many years ago - were sometimes guideposts pointing in different directions.
	
	
	With regard to the question of sufficient material to have some understanding of the range of sentences imposed, this is a case where clearly, from the material presented from the Crown, from my own judicial and personal experience at the bar, and even by regard to the approach taken by his Honour the Acting Judge who dealt with the prisoner by way of special hearing, it is possible to detect an appropriate range of sentence for the offending with which I am concerned. The observations in Moon reflect what is apparent in every sentencing exercise, the need to have regard to the maximum penalty where the offence may fit by way of objective gravity and the considerations of mitigation that may arise.
	
	
	With regard to the submissions of the Crown, the Crown pointed to the need for the prisoner to receive what it described as “condign punishment”, including the need for the total sentence to reflect the totality of the criminality. It cited s 3A in the context of dealing with the various matters that are to be taken into account, including, of course, the matter I have already referred to, recognising the harm done to the victims of the crimes.
	
	
	The Crown conceded by reason of the prisoner’s age alone and perhaps his infirmity that the prisoner, whilst he preyed on the victims for sexual gratification, was in reality at this point unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of the age of the victims at the time of the offending, in respect of the offences that comprise counts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, there is no particular pleading in relation to the age, and each of the victims were, at the relevant time, fairly described as young and vulnerable in the range of victims that might be the subject of such offending. The age of the victims, however, in relation to subsequent charges involves a particular pleading within the count in the indictment. I just make that observation in the context of some submissions made by the Crown, and made also in reply by Mr Norrie for the accused, that when considering aggravating factors, the Court is not to have additional regard to any particular aggravating factor if it is an element of the offence.
	
	
	The Crown puts particular submissions about the objective seriousness of the matter. It made the submission that the objective seriousness of the offences in a global sense was “extreme”; made submissions about what was said to be the breaches of trust involved in the offending. It made submissions about the need to consider the fact that there were multiple offences involving repeated acts committed over a number of years, and submitted that the prisoner was acting in ‘loco parentis’ to the complainants whilst they were on his property. In relation to that last matter, I do not conclude that the prisoner was in loco parentis to any of the victims, but he certainly exercised authority over the victims, to which I will make reference in a moment.
	
	
	The Crown in its submissions said by reference to s 21A(2), in the context of the terms of the general provisions of the section, particularly s 21A(1), that there was emotional harm caused to the victims which was substantial, and this I have already dealt with as correct. It was submitted by the Crown that there was an abuse of trust, particularly in relation to NG, KW and FG, who at the time of the offending were particularly young and vulnerable, with their parents entrusting the prisoner to look after their children whilst visiting his property. I accept that submission.
	
	
	In relation to s 21A(2)(m), the Crown made a submission that that particular aggravation was established in this matter. That particular subparagraph of the subsection refers to “the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts”. As was pointed out by learned counsel for the accused, with no disrespect to the Crown Prosecutor, that submission by the Crown was misconceived. One need only turn to the decision of Fisher v R [2008] NSWCCA 129, where the Court dealt with the issue of multiple acts in the context of a consideration of circumstances of aggravation such as those pleaded by the Crown in its written submissions. That decision approved what the learned Chief Justice Spigelman had said in JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209, that in the proof of a course of conduct as occurs in this matter in relation to all of the victims, it was appropriate to take that into account only for purposes of rejecting any claim to mitigation and attendant reduction of an otherwise appropriate sentence, not as a circumstance of aggravation.
	
	
	It should also be pointed out, of course, that the very terms of s 21A(2)(m) are concerned with the particular offence the subject of a charge requiring sentence, and in respect of the matters in respect of which the prisoner has been found guilty, the particular matters relied upon by the Crown are identified as specific offences, not a series of crimes committed in order to establish the particular count in the indictment.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor also submitted that there were no mitigating factors in this matter.
	
	
	The Crown, in its conclusion, said this:
	


“The sentence imposed must strongly reflect denunciation, punishment, protection of the community, albeit to a lesser degree than usual, as well as specific and general deterrence.”


	
	In general terms one agrees with that, except insofar as the protection of the community, as the Crown concedes is, in reality, not a significant or substantial issue now at the age that the prisoner presents.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the offences occurred in circumstances that “each sentence must be accumulative and non-concurrent”; however, taking into account some principles said to arise in Magnuson. I have noted what the learned Button J said in Magnuson, particularly at paras 143 and 145, to which the Crown referred. The appropriate approach to sentencing when dealing with multiple offences is set out essentially in the majority judgment of Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly at [45].
	
	
	That principle is to be seen in light of decisions of the High Court and decisions following the High Court in this jurisdiction, particularly decisions such as Mill v The Queen ((1988) 166 CLR 59), relating to the totality of sentencing.
	
	
	The Court is required, in the context of Pearce principles, to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then, having fixed an appropriate sentence for each offence, turn to the issue of totality of criminality by appropriate concurrency and accumulation to give ultimate effect by the sentence imposed by that method. The method of accumulating each sentence upon one another would have the effect of sentences reportedly imposed in Texas one might have thought.
	
	
	The defence did not provide any written submissions. The oral submissions of the Crown were short, merely adopting the written submissions provided.
	
	
	Mr Norrie did take issue with the submission of the Crown relevant to s 21A(2)(m), and particularly referred to Fisher and the decision of Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145 particularly at [28] and [29] to which I have had regard.
	
	
	He noted the requirement of the Court to have regard to the sentencing practices of the time if able to be identified as cited in Magnuson and other decisions to which Magnuson refers.
	
	
	It was conceded that the offences were serious offences but not the most extreme of offences of their type. It noted the age of the victims where that was reflected in the pleadings or the particulars, and where ages were specifically pleaded, as was properly pointed out, the relevant age of the victim was not an independent aggravating factor under s 21A(2).
	
	
	It was conceded that the prisoner’s relationship with the victims involved a breach of trust and that the prisoner exercised authority over the victims, but it was submitted that, having regard to each of the individual counts that were to be considered by relevance to the particular complainant therein particularised, the breach of trust was not the grossest abuse of that trust.
	
	
	It was pointed out by Mr Norrie that his client had a criminal history that showed no prior convictions for sexual assault. That is correct, but it must be pointed out, as I pointed out to him in the course of oral submission, that from the time that he committed the first offence against NG onwards, the evidence revealed that he was an unconvicted abuser of young boys, and he remained undetected in this regard until arrested earlier this century. The fact that he was undetected, or unreported, in fact gave him the opportunity to commit further crimes against victims over a period of time. Ultimately, this was accepted by counsel for the accused to be the reality of the situation.
	
	
	The facts of the matter were that if his criminal history in 1976 at the time of the first offending was relevant, it was relevant to establish that he was not entitled to any particular leniency. As each crime was committed against each victim, the prisoner’s reliance upon what weight, if any, could be given to the fact he had no prior convictions for sexual assault diminished, and diminished very rapidly, for the reason I just outlined.
	
	
	It was pointed out, correctly, that because of his health and age his circumstances of custody would be harsher than otherwise would be the case for the ordinary prisoner in the general gaol population.’
	
	
	As to the issue of whether his convictions would create particular hardship, some hearsay material was before the Court. But, in reality, there is no evidence that the circumstances of his offending lead to an increased hardship in conditions of custody. It is, as I say, primarily his age and his health difficulties that exacerbate his circumstances and create some hardships that would otherwise be not experienced by younger, fitter members of the general gaol population. I have taken that into account.
	
	
	I have already referred to the fact that I have taken into account all the medical evidence that has been made available to me in assessing the appropriate sentence in this matter. Ultimately the health of the prisoner is more relevant to the fixing of a non-parole period than the fixing of appropriate sentences. There is absolutely nothing in the evidence available to the Court to suggest that his medical condition, or any aspect of his medical condition, has any causal relationship to the offending for which he has been found guilty.
	
	
	Reliance was made in the submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner to the delay in the finalisation of this matter. I have already referred to the fact that I have had regard to the extensive chronology prepared by the Crown. There was reference to the delay between the charging of the prisoner, which I am informed from the chronology was 21 August 2002, to the matter finally being dealt with at least by way of special hearing by Acting Judge McGuire in 2009.
	
	
	The picture, at least from this summary in the chronology, is a very complex one. I am not in a position to ascribe “fault” only to the prisoner in relation to the delay which is quite unacceptable. I have already made comments about delay in this matter. Not just delay in the matter coming before me last April, but delays in the matter since I was given responsibility for it. As I have earlier said, I feel in fact I have no responsibility for any delay: I have done my very best to keep the matter moving forward.
	
	
	Having said that, without going into the detail of the chronology, I note the various applications that led to adjournments, including the need for examination to be had of the prisoner’s fitness to be tried; in one sense the delays caused by that, leading up to the fact that the prisoner was found unfit to be tried, are partially explicable by the fact that he was so found by the Court and the special hearing was conducted in 2009.
	
	
	I note some other complications that arose in the conduct of the matter, although they certainly do not excuse the delay. One of the complications was the fact that the victim NG, for example, and I do not criticise the victim of course, apparently came forward some years after the initial charging of the prisoner. There were attendant delays in determining which matters should be tried together and the like in that context. There was also the fact that the Director determined that there be no further proceedings against the prisoner in 2006, although that decision was quickly reversed.
	
	
	I am very mindful of the frustration the victims have felt. I have already made some comment about some remarks that were made to a journalist about this matter. It could not be said that I have been unsympathetic to that. The truth of the matter is, as I have made clear on a number of occasions, that I have tried very hard to ensure the matter did proceed to finality as expeditiously as can reasonably be expected, at least on my part.
	
	
	In any event, there has been considerable delay up until the time the prisoner came into custody and now there has been the delay between the time he came into custody and the final resolution of the matter at least in this jurisdiction by the Court in December last year. As to whether the prisoner alone was trying to delay the inevitable throughout the entirety of the time is not entirely clear from the material available to me, and of course various judges have acceded to particular applications over the period of time reflected in the chronology by the various parties.
	
	
	It must be remembered, of course, that courts are not prosecuting authorities, nor defending authorities for that matter, and they are very much captive to the conduct of the parties in a range of ways, particularly so far as being fully informed about matters relevant to applications for adjournment and the like.
	
	
	The truth of the matter is, as I would understand it, however, that the prisoner finally came to court and appears in court today in not as robust health as would have been the case had the matters been able to be dealt with expeditiously back at the beginning of the century. There has been some delay over which the prisoner has had no control.
	
	
	For three years the prisoner was in fact serving a limited term, found unfit to be tried, before another judge in 2012 determined that the prisoner was in fact fit to be tried.
	
	
	Learned counsel for the prisoner referred the Court to the decision of Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 particularly paras [16], [17]. That decision discussed consideration of the principles set out in Todd ((1982) 2 NSWLR 517 – (at 519)), a New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal decision, and the decision of Mill to which I earlier made reference, where there had been delay by reason of an offender being required to serve sentences interstate for offending which was contemporaneous with the offending required to be considered at bar.
	
	
	Particularly at para [19] the Court in Fahda considered, in the judgment of Simpson J, the relevance of Todd principles in circumstances other than those particularly pertinent to the Todd and Mill cases. Her Honour referred to authorities such as that from Grove J expressing the view that a prisoner who came to be sentenced a long time after the commission of the offence could not claim the benefit of delay as a matter of special mitigation where the delay was attributable to his own choice to contest the Crown case. His Honour in that matter had considered that the prisoner was liable to be sentenced from the date of the offence and delays brought about by his denial of guilt ought not sound in mitigation. It was noted that the delay in that matter was caused in part by the fact that a conviction following an earlier trial was quashed in that Court and a new trial ordered.
	
	
	Sheller J, in the judgment of Bragias (1997) 92 A Crim R 330, expressed the opinion that the delay was a consideration appropriate to be taken into account on sentencing and adherence to a plea of not guilty subsequently shown to have been unjustified ought not deprive the applicant of any benefit he might otherwise be entitled to arising from a lengthy lapse of time between the offence and sentencing.
	
	
	Her Honour Simpson J noted:
	


“As the third member of the Court in that case I expressed no view on the difference of opinion that emerged. I remain unprepared to endorse a universal proposition as to the effect on the Todd principles of delay resulting from adherence to the right to enter a plea of not guilty and to put the Crown to proof. I would, however, express a preference for the view that, generally speaking, the exercise of such a right should not operate to exclude the Todd principles. It must be recognised that delays attendant upon a plea of not guilty lie essentially at the door of the overburdened criminal justice system which is inadequately resourced to afford speedy resolution of contested charges. It is, of course, true, as Grove J said, that an offender is liable to sentence from the date of the offence, but this is no answer to the recognition given by Street CJ (in Todd) to the additional pressure that results from delays in the resolution of these matters. In the circumstances applicable to this case (of Fahda) the observations of Grove J in Bragias do not persuade me that the Todd principles should not be applied. In my opinion the delay was a relevant consideration, and one which, subject to the matter I next mention, was available to be taken into account in the applicant’s favour.”


	
	The delay here is something I take into account to some extent to the prisoner’s favour, but it does not sound, in my view, in ‘special mitigation’ or substantial mitigation, particularly in the circumstance where, of course, the earlier period of custody before today primarily arose out of the findings of the special hearing. I accept that the prisoner has been left in a state of uncertainty, but so have the victims, although they are not for sentence by me.
	
	
	One matter that needs to be pointed out, that was discussed in Todd, and was of particular pertinence in Todd, was that in this matter, and I do not criticise the prisoner, there is just no evidence of the progress of the rehabilitation as sometimes can occur in delay in sentencing. It is to be remembered in Todd’s case that when he came back to New South Wales for sentence he had been in interstate custody and had made considerable progress in his rehabilitation before he came back to this State. He thus came for sentence as a different person than the offender had been at the time of the offending.
	
	
	This prisoner is a different person physically, of course. He was, a person, notwithstanding some complaints of physical indisposition at the time of the alleged offending, who was robust and obviously commanded considerable physical presence in the presence of the victims, but he comes to this Court now, unlike Mr Todd, entirely unrepentant. Of course he was entitled to deny his guilt, and of course our system of justice does not penalise offenders for denying their guilt, even in the face of overwhelming evidence. Ultimately the principles laid down by the superior courts are quite clear, that whilst an offender cannot be penalised for defending a matter, he obviously does get no benefit for any contrition. 
	
	
	After the submissions were completed, I raised with counsel the relevance in this matter, in light of the orders made by Acting Judge McGuire, of what is described as “the ceiling principle”. The ceiling principle as it is described in some authorities, and also discussed in the sentencing bench book, is an aspect of what might be called double jeopardy principles, the general recognition within the criminal law, subject to particular exceptions including statutory exceptions, that because the individual is prosecuted by the State, he or she should not be subject to “double jeopardy” in his or her treatment by the conduct of the prosecuting authority.
	
	
	There is a general principle relating to the sentencing of an offender after retrial that he or she should not ordinarily receive a longer sentence or a longer non-parole period than that imposed after the first trial, unless there are particular significant circumstances to be taken into account. This was held in the New South Wales decision of Gilmour (1979) 1 A Crim R 419 at 419, and was essentially reaffirmed in the decision referred to by the learned Crown Prosecutor of RHMcL v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 472 at [72].
	
	
	It is clear, however, as the Crown pointed out in its helpful written submissions, that this principle is not intended to fetter the independent discretion of a sentencing judge, and there are a number of authorities, including the decision of Merritt [2000] NSWCCA 365 at [29] to that effect.
	
	
	Some of the matters that may be considered in the context where the ceiling principle has no direct relevance, is where the original sentence was “manifestly inadequate”, or to use words more appropriate at first instance, “remarkably lenient”. But the circumstances in which the sentence may be increased are rare.
	
	
	The Crown in its written submissions, by reference to the High Court decision to which I referred, and other judgments, including the decision of Tarrant v R [2007] NSWCCA 124, submitted that so far as the general principles are concerned, the restraint of the “ceiling principle” was subject to a number of exceptions.
	
	
	It also, however, referred me to a decision with which I was not familiar, R v Wilson (2005) 153 A Crim R 257. It was submitted that that decision specifically addressed the concerns I raised for consideration by the parties of the relevance of the penalties imposed by his Honour Acting Judge McGuire at the special hearing. I particularly note what the Court said about the matter at [14]-[17].
	
	
	I found the decision of Wilson actually quite interesting, because in one sense it is not actually on all fours with the situation with which I am now faced in a practical sense. In Wilson, the prisoner had been found guilty after a special hearing, after which the learned then Chief Judge at Common Law, Wood J, as I would understand it - he may have been not the Chief Judge but certainly a Judge of the Supreme Court - fixed a limiting term of 18 years. The sentencing judge at a trial after the prisoner had been found fit to be tried determined that she would not be bound by that limiting term and fixed a sentence of 12 years imprisonment with a relevant non-parole period. The appeal in Wilson was an appeal by the Crown against Simpson J’s judgment. The Court in re-sentencing the prisoner sentenced him to 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years.
	
	
	Noting what their Honours said about the role of the limiting term by reference to the imposition of a term of imprisonment imposed after trial and sentence, it is to be noted that the consequence in Wilson was ultimately for the offender to receive a lesser sentence than that imposed after a special hearing, rather than a greater sentence.
	
	
	I am mindful of the terms of s 23A Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, that a limiting term is “the best estimate of the sentence the Court considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence and the person found guilty of that offence”. It is to be borne in mind, of course, that a limiting term is a “sentence” for the purposes of the Criminal Appeal Act (see s 2 of that Act).
	
	
	Whilst a person serving a limiting term is a forensic patient under the Act, when the limiting term expires and where the term is less than life imprisonment, that person ceases to be a forensic patient and must be discharged unless that person is to be classified as an involuntary patient under other provisions of the same Act (see s 3, 42, 52, 53 and 54). Prior to the expiry of a limiting term, a person may be released from detention by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, subject to six monthly review.
	
	
	In the decision of Mailes v R (2004) 62 NSWLR 181 at [32] it was observed that the purpose of a limiting term is not to punish the person who has been convicted of any crime but to ensure that he or she is not detained longer than the ‘maximum time the person could have been detained if convicted following a proper trial’. Furthermore in Mailes, it was held that the head sentence is not affected by the absence of a power to fix a non parole period, which is the case with a limiting term, and which happened here. There was no logical reason for reducing the head sentence because there was no provision for a non-parole period it was held in Mailes (at [43]). Of course, in that decision at [44] the Court noted the differing features and objectives between regular sentences and limiting terms.
	
	
	In any event, I note the submission of the Crown and I accept the principles that are set out in Wilson. But I also point to what ultimately, by reference to this case, will be the reverse decision, because ultimately the penalties to be imposed upon the prisoner will be greater than those imposed by his Honour Acting Judge McGuire.
	
	
	So far as the mental condition of the prisoner is concerned, I have already pointed out the evidence shows no causal connection between his mental condition and the offending. Thus the principles that are summarised in decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal such as Hemsley, from 2004, and De La Rosa, a Commonwealth sentencing matter from 2010, do not directly apply.
	
	
	No issue arises relating to the diminution that might be given to general deterrence, or even increasing the weight to be given to specific deterrence because of some causal relationship between the mental condition of the offender and the offending.
	
	
	However, the condition of the offender reflected in the medical evidence such as led to him being found unfit to be tried, as was discussed in the fitness to be tried matters before me most pertinently, are to be considered in the context of considering his risk of reoffending and the protection of the community, which are not substantial issues now in this case. Those matters are also relevant to the circumstances of his custody, one matter identified in the De La Rosa and Hemsley summaries of relevant principle. I have taken that into account.
	
	
	Turning now back to the objective facts of the matter, the evidence reveals the prisoner sexually exploited the victims over an extended period of time of over 13 years. His exploitation of each of the victims was systematic and determined. The prisoner in each case gained the trust of the victims by grooming them with either promises of paid work, access to motor vehicles or motor cycles which they otherwise would not have access to, allowing them to drive motor vehicles and ride motor vehicles, either legally or illegally, it does not matter, exciting them with the offer of activities to which they were attracted, providing them with rewards in the character of outings and other incentives in various ways as I detailed in the evidence in the judgment to maintain the relationship.
	
	
	It is correct to point out the prisoner used his superior position to the victims to exploit them sexually, although there has to be some discerning of some differences between the circumstances of each of the victims.
	
	
	The relationships of the prisoner with the victims KW, DC, and to a lesser extent GG, were particularly complex ones, as the facts reveal, and the relationship particularly between KW and DC developed in circumstances where in fact a sexual relationship existed between them beyond the period covered by the pleadings in the charge, in circumstances where they had opportunity to walk away. But they had been exploited to the extent where they found it difficult to make that decision.
	
	
	In every case the exploitation of the victims commenced at a young age, particularly the exploitation of NG, FG, KW and GG.
	
	
	The evidence of the complainants, making proper allowance for the impact on their lives individually, shows that the conduct of the prisoner involved in each case multiple events, demonstrating that the offences for which the prisoner is to be sentenced are not uncharacteristic or isolated matters.
	
	
	There are features of each of the offences that distinguish the offending in each instance, in my view of the evidence, from the global characterisation made by the Crown. Obviously, there was exploitation of the victims and their vulnerability to varying degrees and a taking advantage of them. The vulnerability of the victims NG, FG and KW, particularly KW in the early period, as with DC and GG, is self-evident. However, the evidence revealed, because of what could be basically described as the “cleverness” or the insidiousness of the prisoner, that the offences were not accompanied by direct threats of intimidation, violence or real physical injury, other, of course, than the pain suffered by the perpetration of the offending, particularly by penetration. There were no real threats of retribution by the prisoner if exposed.
	
	
	In the context of the reality of the relationship of the prisoner with his victims there was no special relationship between the prisoner and the victims by reason of kinship or because the victims were placed by authorities under his care or placed under his supervision. There is no suggestion of the prisoner keeping any of the victims captive or in any way holding them against their will. They were free, and had the opportunity, to “walk away”.
	
	
	Of course, many of the offences were committed against victims that were dependent upon him at the relevant time for transportation, food and/or shelter, particularly, as I say, NG, FG, to some extent DC and GG on occasions. He was, in most instances, at the time of the commission of the offences, in a position of authority vis-à-vis the victims.
	
	
	The victims came under the sphere of influence of the prisoner in a range of differing circumstances. It is quite clear that the parents of NG and HG entrusted their children to be looked after by the prisoner when he took them on outings to the speedway and brought them back to his place at Morisset for them to be ultimately sexually assaulted. KW lived nearby, and his family lived relatively nearby at all relevant times, which made him less “dependent” on the care of the prisoner when he stayed there. DC also lived not too far away. I do not mean any disrespect to DC, but it is clear from the evidence that his opportunity to come under the sphere of influence of the prisoner occurred in circumstances where he seemed to have little parental direction. As I have said earlier, however, it could not be said in any real way that the prisoner was in ‘loco parentis’ to any of the victims.
	
	
	In relation to FG and NG, their families lived a considerable distance away from Morisset when they were placed in the care of the prisoner.
	
	
	There was also in the commission of the offences to varying degrees breaches of trust reposited in the prisoner, particularly by the parents of NG and FG, as well as KW to some extent particularly in the early period of time.
	
	
	I bear in mind, of course, the evidence, which I accept, from KW that the prisoner had specifically ingratiated himself with KW’s parents in a way that did not appear as apparent in relation to the other victims, having travelled to New Zealand with the family.
	
	
	The special relationship it seems that the prisoner developed with KW’s parents made it very difficult, in my view, for him to sever the relationship. I accept that all of the victims, whether it be by emotional blackmail or financial or other material dependence on the prisoner, particularly KW, DC and GG, had considerable difficulty severing their relationship with the prisoner, notwithstanding the fact that they understood the corrupting influence he was upon them.
	
	
	Of course, it goes without saying that, however one categorises it, having regard to the objective features of the case that I have summarised, each of the offences were serious matters. This is self-evident, not only by the maximum penalties, bearing in mind similar offending now would require, if conducted in the current period, consideration of much greater maximum penalties, but also the character of the offending.
	
	
	No issue of consent is relevant. But, of course, it should be borne in mind in relation particularly to counts 1 to 5 that consent is not a relevant issue. But even in circumstances where the victims had started to advance in age, there was clearly a taking of advantage of them. The respective offences involved significant exploitation of the victims, and particularly in the early stages of the relationship relating to KW, GG and DC.
	
	
	So far as RR is concerned, he has been deceased for a number of years. He came within the prisoner’s sphere of influence through his friendship with other victims. But the extent of his dependence upon the prisoner is not immediately clear from the evidence.
	
	
	Ultimately, in relation to s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, noting what I have said earlier about the Crown’s submissions, it might be said that, in relation to RR, that particular offence as pleaded was committed in the presence of a child under the age of 18 years, having regard to the facts I identified.
	
	
	I have already noted the uniform relevance of the emotional harm to each of the victims as a relevant aggravating factor, and I have already noted the abuse of trust or authority in relation to each of the victims, the intensity of that varying as with the vulnerability of the victims as an aggravating factor, particularly NG, HG, KW in the early years of the prisoner’s offending, as well as the early years of the prisoner’s offending towards DC.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors that arise under s 21A(3), the issue of planning is a matter I have considered, and which nobody has particularly addressed. It is obviously clear that the prisoner schemed to get access to the victims. I have not found that as an aggravating factor, nor was it urged upon me, but I cannot find it as a mitigating factor that the offence was not part of planned activity. The matter is in balance rather than capable of being established on balance in the prisoner’s favour. I obviously could not find that the prisoner was of good character. I am prepared to conclude, in light of his age, that he is unlikely to reoffend. I cannot, however, conclude that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. Obviously there is no remorse or contrition displayed by the prisoner at any stage in relation to the matter. Ultimately, the subjective case conducted on behalf of the prisoner is largely concerned with the medical evidence and the issue of delay, which I have taken into account but which is a relatively minor matter in the scheme of things.
	
	
	It is, of course, not the job of judges to be personally abusive. However, the truth is the prisoner was a hypocrite. He gave the persona of responsibility towards people which led to him having the opportunity to exploit people for his own sexual purposes. This was reflected in one of the newspaper articles that I was shown during the course of the trial. That public persona, however, was a complete charade, as the evidence of the victims made clear in the sentencing process.
	
	
	The sentencing of the prisoner is complicated, I accept that, and it is detailed. I apologise to everyone with an interest in this matter who is here now for taking so long to go through all the relevant matters.
	
	
	I want to point out some other matters though that are relevant. I have had regard to the sentences imposed by his Honour Acting Judge McGuire, if only to understand at the very least the circumstances in which the prisoner is currently in custody. It should be said of his Honour Acting Judge McGuire that at the time that he sentenced this prisoner, he was a very, very experienced judge. He had been a judge of this Court from 1980, thus in 2009 had 29 years of judicial experience.
	
	
	I am very mindful, in light of what Button J said about the relevance of judicial experience in sentencing. This is not a matter just confined to the wisdom of judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal. His Honour the Acting Judge brought to the sentencing of the prisoner, in the context of course, of the relevant legislative provisions relating to limiting terms, a great deal of knowledge from the period of time over which he was sitting in this Court sentencing many offenders for offences of this type, although in his judgment he did not specifically refer to that aspect.
	
	
	I also point out, of course, not that this is a matter of any importance, but his Honour, as a rule, was regarded as not a lenient sentencer. I think that is self evident, and he would have admitted it himself privately and publicly.
	
	
	Ultimately, as I understand the structure of the sentences that he imposed, he imposed a limiting term that would expire in October 2017, bearing in mind he imposed sentences that were partially accumulative, partially concurrent, and some entirely concurrent one with the other.
	
	
	In that regard the ultimate effect of the sentences he imposed was a limiting term of slightly less than eight years imprisonment.
	
	
	I have borne in mind, so far as any sentences imposed by Acting Judge McGuire have any relevance in this sentencing exercise, that I acquitted the accused, unbeknownst to me, because I was not particularly paying any attention to Acting Judge McGuire’s sentencing regime (it was totally irrelevant really up until now) in relation to one count which actually extended the period the prisoner was to be in custody to a date in October 2017.
	
	
	I sat down in good conscience, having regard to the comparative cases, my own experience, the objective facts and the subjective facts, to construct the appropriate sentences and form my own independent view as to what the sentences would be. This had the consequence that in some instances I have increased the sentences imposed by way of limiting term by his Honour; I have also, to some extent, adjusted, or by result, changed the character of the concurrency and accumulation that was fixed by his Honour.
	
	
	The ultimate decision I have reached in the context of all relevant matters taken into account is that I should impose a total sentence of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight and a half years.
	
	
	It transpired, I can say with all honesty, that when I finally determined what I regarded as the appropriate sentences, that the effective non-parole period expires at the expiration, by coincidence as it turned out, of the limiting term fixed by the learned Acting Judge who dealt with the prisoner when he was a special patient.
	
	
	Thus the sentences I impose are as follows.
	
	
	Firstly, in relation to count 1 in the indictment, the prisoner is convicted. He is sentenced to a term of three years imprisonment to date from 29 April 2009. On my calculation that sentence will expire on 28 April 2012.
	
	
	In relation to count 2, the prisoner is convicted. He is sentenced to five years imprisonment to date from 29 April 2009. That sentence will expire on 28 April 2014.
	
	
	In each case I decline to fix a non-parole period, having regard to the totality of sentences imposed.
	
	
	In relation to count 3, concerning FG, with a maximum penalty of two years, I sentence him to 18 months imprisonment. That sentence will date from 29 April 2009, and on my calculation, expire on 28 October 2010.
	
	
	In relation to count 4, relating to KW, I convict the prisoner, as I do for all counts, and impose a sentence of five years imprisonment. That will date from 29 April 2012 and expire on 28 April 2017.
	
	
	In relation to count 5, the attempt bestiality charge, the prisoner is convicted. He is sentenced to three years imprisonment. That likewise will date from 29 April 2012 and will expire on 28 April 2015.
	
	
	In relation to count 6, I sentence the prisoner to 18 months imprisonment on conviction. That sentence will date from 29 April 2012 and expire on 28 October 2013.
	
	
	In relation to count 7, concerning DC, the maximum penalty being 10 years - his Honour, I point out, as with some of the other sentences, imposed a lower limiting term - I impose a sentence of three years imprisonment. That sentence will date from 29 April 2015. In respect of that sentence I fix a non parole period of two years and six months which will expire on 28 October 2017.
	
	
	In fixing a non-parole period for that matter, I fix it by regard to the need by reason primarily of special circumstances, but also by reason of the circumstances of the custody of the prisoner and the need for a slightly extended period for him to adjust to community living with the assistance of the Probation and Parole Service under a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	In relation to count 9, I impose a sentence of five years imprisonment. That is to date from 29 April 2016, but in that matter I fix a non-parole period of 18 months, one year six months, to date from 29 April 2016 to expire on 28 October 2017.
	
	
	In relation to count 10, again involving DC, I sentence the prisoner to a term of imprisonment of five years to date from 29 April 2016, and in respect of that matter I fix a non-parole period of one year six months to date from that date, expiring on 28 October 2017.  I note in relation to count 9 and 10, his Honour fixed limiting terms of two years six months.
	
	
	In relation to count 11, the offence involving RR, the offender is convicted. He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years to date from 29 April 2015. In relation to that matter I fix a non-parole period of two years six months, to expire on 28 October 2017.
	
	
	In relation to the offence involving GG, count 13, carrying a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, I impose a term of imprisonment of 18 months. That will date from 29 April 2016 and expire on 28 October 2017. In respect of that offence I do not fix a non-parole period because it is concurrent with the non-parole periods I have fixed in relation to the offences committed against DC.
	
	
	I have not on all occasions pointed to what penalties were imposed by the learned Acting Judge after sentencing in respect of the special hearing matters. But as I said earlier, by reference to what he did, as a fact, not as a relevant consideration, a number of the sentences I have imposed are greater than that imposed by his Honour, forming my own view of the matter, having regard to all the matters I am required to take into account.
	
	
	Thus, the effective sentence imposed upon the prisoner is one of 12 years with a non-parole period of eight years six months. The effective non parole period will expire on 28 October 2017. The parole authority will have the responsibility of determining whether the prisoner should be released to the community on that date. 
	



	
	Mr Anning, the total sentence I have imposed upon you is 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight years six months. That will expire, as I have fixed it, on 28 October, that is the effective non-parole period, 2017.
	
	
	You will not get a chance to speak to your counsel today; I cannot make arrangements for you to speak to him privately, I am afraid, but I am sure that counsel will have an opportunity to speak to you about the matter in the short term.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Your Honour, can I just say that before you went away before Christmas, November, I was promised you would be back earlier, and I’ve not seen nobody till now. And the other thing was, I was to get the transcript of the last hearing, and I broke in, and I apologise, about you not getting the evidence. You’ve been fed - I mean, they’re creating what you have to lie about. In all honesty, I know what you’re doing was, you’re being inveigled by someone else. Now, the thing is, I don’t know what my team is going to do. I’ve listened carefully, not that I can hear things really okay. I’m not guilty. That will have its consequences later. But the words weren’t kept, there was ..(not transcribable).. this has been the trouble all along, I can’t get people to keep their word, and inform me. I’ve been assaulted, I’ve been everything, and I had no-one I could go to--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well, Mr Anning, most of the matters you have raised with me are irrelevant to me at this point.
	
	
	In relation to the matter, in terms of the delay, as I pointed out, in December, not as a matter of compassion but as a matter of courtesy, I have already indicated when the matter was before me in March that I could not sentence you before now for these two reasons. When the matter came before me in March, and I will get the date in a moment, because I believe it was 14 March, I was due to go to Orange about a week or two later to sit for three weeks, and then I was out of the jurisdiction for five weeks and I only resumed back at work last Monday week, and I requested in the time that I was at Orange that the parties provide me if needs be with some written submissions to address an issue that had not been addressed, at least an issue that I needed assistance with, and as it transpired, the submissions were received, there was some delay, but I make no criticism of that, it did not affect the determination of the matter. The truth of the matter was that I have tried to deal with the matter by way of sentence at the first reasonable opportunity available to me, in the context of having to do other work and not sitting in Sydney for over two months. So that is the reason for that delay.
	
	
	OFFENDER: There wasn’t the recognition of the medical stuff that you - you got none. You mentioned it plenty of times, insufficient evidence. Right through the whole eight years, there’s been a cry, I’ve not got enough evidence. Now the thing is, that girdled the whole thing about my - I listened to the medical and what I’ve read from what statements I have, and it’s totally at odds, it’s totally at odds to what you’re saying ..(not transcribable).. what you said, you’re not getting information.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right, thank you. Thank you, Mr Anning. I understand what you are saying, but there is nothing more that I can say to you. I will invite your counsel to confer with you, that is your right, and those matters can be taken care of. If there are matters I have not taken into account that I am required to take into account, that is a matter for the parties to address appropriately. That is, at this late stage, beyond my control. Thank you.

2764033,R v Warren Ross [2014] NSWSC 707,"Judgment

Remarks on Sentence

1HIS HONOUR: Warren Ross pleaded not guilty to the murder of Tanilla Opal Warrick-Deaves (the deceased), the daughter of his de-facto wife. On 5 December 2013, after a seven-week trial, a jury convicted the offender as charged. The deceased was aged two years and eight months at the time of her death. 

2Because of difficulties associated with the capacity of doctors to gain access to Warren Ross (the offender), the sentence hearing occurred over two days, 28 February 2014 and 9 May 2014. It now falls to the Court to sentence the offender. 

The Process of Sentencing

3To those unfamiliar with the process of sentencing, some aspects of the task may seem difficult to understand. The Court is required to assess the objective seriousness of an offence within the range of conduct with which offences of that kind are concerned. Thus, even, as here, where one is speaking of murder as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar, it is necessary to assess the conduct of the offender to determine where, in that range of seriousness, this offence fits. 

4It is only for the worst category of offences that one imposes the maximum sentence fixed by the Parliament. A sentence of life imprisonment is the maximum sentence for murder. Whether a particular offence is in that category is not ascertained by imagining conduct that could be worse. Unfortunately, one can always imagine a worse scenario. Nevertheless, the Court must assess objectively the features of the offence and the circumstances of its commission in order to determine whether it is in the category of a worst case or lower down the scale of seriousness within a notional range between the lowest level of culpability and the worst category of case. 

5The purpose in sentencing any offender is to resolve what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting sentencing objectives. In serious crimes such as murder, the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large. These include the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform. 

6Each of these objectives, but particularly the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, punishment and the need for rehabilitation must be assessed having regard to the gravity of the circumstances, viewed objectively, within the range of offending comprehended by the offence charged. These point, most obviously, to the protection of society, deterrence of the offender and deterrence of others who might be tempted to offend, and to retribution. 

7Considerations of reform or rehabilitation of the offender may also be significantly affected by the objective circumstances of the offence but they are more directly affected by the subjective circumstances of the offender and the capacity for the offender to be rehabilitated. The capacity for, and the likelihood, if any, of rehabilitation, in turn, impacts upon the degree to which a sentence is fixed, which ensures the protection of society and the personal deterrence of the offender. 

8This process is one that involves what has been described as ""intuitive synthesis"". It takes each of the objective circumstances of the offence and each of the subjective circumstances of the offender and synthesises them to achieve the purposes of sentencing already described. 

9Every murder is serious. Every murder involves the taking of human life by a person who has a state of mind that elevates the seriousness of the offence to that which is the most serious of crimes in the criminal calendar. As already stated, the maximum sentence for murder is life imprisonment, which penalty is imposed in the worst category of murder. In this case, because the age of the deceased is less than eighteen, the legislature has set a standard non-parole period of 25 years' imprisonment. The standard non-parole period acts as a guidepost in the determination of an appropriate sentence. 

10In order to determine the objective seriousness of this offence, amongst those perceived as the most serious in view of society's respect for the sanctity of human life, it is necessary to deal with the circumstances of the offence and some facts leading up to the infliction of the fatal injuries, together with the treatment of the deceased for the period beyond the time when the offender inflicted the injuries from which Tanilla died. 

Facts

11The offender formed a relationship with Tanilla's mother and moved into her house some two months prior to the period during which the injuries were inflicted. The mother, Ms Deaves, had three children, the youngest of whom was the deceased. The evidence before the Court, including material adduced from the offender, referred to the relationship between the offender and the three children and the fact that the deceased, and her sisters, referred to the offender as ""Daddy""; a term of which the offender was particularly proud. 

12In the short time that the offender lived with Ms Deaves and her three children, he assumed the care of the deceased and acted in the role of parent. 

13In the course of the trial, the Crown adduced tendency evidence relating to the offender's treatment of the deceased in order to prove that he had a tendency to conduct himself in a particular way and had a state of mind relevant to proving that the fatal injuries were inflicted with murderous intent. 

14The tendency evidence included the abuse of Tanilla in the street shortly after the offender commenced cohabiting with the family. It also included an incident a month before the infliction of the fatal injuries in which the neighbours heard the offender whipping Tanilla with a belt or rod. The tendency evidence was compelling. 

15That evidence, whilst available to the Crown to prove the tendency of the offender to act in a particular way or have a state of mind, is not evidence of the conduct directly associated with the infliction of the fatal injuries and cannot be (and is not) taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. 

16There are other incidents that establish the context in which the offence was committed, although not all are relevant in assessing the objective circumstances of the offence for sentencing purposes. Evidence was adduced, from an independent witness, of the offender punishing Tanilla. This punishment included forcing her to run laps from one end of a lounge/living area to the other end and back over a significant period of time. At the time the child had a bandaged hand and the offender informed this witness that the child had dropped a toolbox on her hand. 

17The toolbox was tendered in evidence. It is heavy. It remains heavy whether or not it contained a metal head mallet, the inclusion of which created a minor controversy. I do not accept that the child would have picked up that toolbox. She did not drop it on her own hand. That issue is largely irrelevant to anything the Court must now decide. 

18The aspect of this witness' evidence that is relevant is the exchange between them in which the offender said:

""I can make her scream, watch this."" (Transcript Page 217)

And at a later stage:

""Watch me make her scream. I'll tell her I'm getting the belt."" (Transcript Page 219)


At that point the offender told the child he was getting the belt and she screamed. 

19The foregoing is probative of the state of mind of the offender when punishing Tanilla. When the witness rebuked the offender that the punishment was ""a bit harsh for the little three year old"" his response was that ""she deserves it, for not behaving herself."" (Transcript 219)

20Tanilla was not yet three at the time that these incidents were occurring. 

21By the end of August 2011, the offender was engaged in a process that was intended to toilet train Tanilla. That process included punishment of the kind already described, namely, the running of laps of the lounge room, hitting the child with objects, including an electric cord, forcing the child to stand in one place for extended periods and whipping the child (to the extent that may be different from the foregoing) with a cord or belt. These punishments were inflicted by the offender. 

22The offender submitted that I should not accept fully the evidence of Ms Deaves, the mother of the deceased who gave evidence of these episodes. During the course of the trial, repeated in directions, I warned the jury in relation to their acceptance of Ms Deaves' evidence because of the risk that she had minimised her involvement in the offences in question and her involvement in the offence itself together with other factors such as reasons to lie about the offender and the inconsistent statements she gave to police. Nevertheless, the jury, in my view correctly, accepted her evidence, at least in relevant respects. As do I. 

23In the period leading up to when the fatal injuries were inflicted, Ms Deaves attested to the fact that Warren Ross was fine about Tanilla soiling herself at first but later became annoyed and very angry about it (Transcript 482). 

24In the days leading to her death, the offender was punishing Tanilla in the pattern of the previous punishments, namely the running of laps and hitting her with a belt or cord (Transcript 496). Ms Deaves tried to stop him and the offender ceased for a short time. 

25After smoking some marijuana, he again required Tanilla to run laps. Ms Deaves went to the kitchen to cook dinner and while there Tanilla had an accident, soiling herself. The offender took Tanilla to the bathroom and the shower was run. Ms Deaves heard a thud from the bathroom, while she was in the kitchen. 

26In her evidence, Ms Deaves described the noise as ""a shuddering thud, like something hitting glass"". She went to the bathroom and saw that the offender had hold of Tanilla by her hair; the shower was running; the door was open. The shower was cold. 

27The offender said to Tanilla: 

""You don't like cold water, do you? You don't shit in my house. You're an animal"".

28Tanilla was shivering. Ms Deaves said ""that's enough; she doesn't look good."" For that comment, the offender slapped Ms Deaves in the face. 

29The offender then banged Tanilla's head, which he was still holding, into the glass of the shower twice. The shower was still running. Water was everywhere. Tanilla looked drowsy, as if she was going to faint. 

30The offender then shoved Ms Deaves back into the hallway where she slid in water. There was an argument. 

31The offender then took Tanilla to the toilet. He held her over the toilet by one leg; she started to cry and scream. 

32The offender was shouting at Tanilla and said: ""you're a black dog; you're a black cunt!"" He held her over the toilet for some period and then took Tanilla back into the shower. The water was ""freezing cold"". The offender turned to Ms Deaves and said ""get her fucking dressed"". 

33There was water everywhere from the constant running of the shower. The shower was then turned off. Tanilla came out of the shower but could hardly stand. She dropped to the floor where the offender kicked her, or pushed her with his leg, so that Tanilla slid across the floor on her stomach into the linen cupboard, a distance of approximately a metre. Her head hit the linen cupboard. 

34It seems that Tanilla bounced back from the linen closet, and the offender kicked her or slid her using his foot. Once more, Tanilla's head hit the linen cupboard. 

35There are stains on the linen cupboard that are consistent with the foregoing story. It is not clear whether the fatal injuries were caused by the banging of the head in the shower or by the banging of the head on the linen cupboard. In either case, it was the conduct of the offender that occasioned it. On one view, it may have been both. 

36Despite the caution with which I approach the evidence of Ms Deaves, I accept the foregoing from her evidence and I accept those facts beyond reasonable doubt save for the fact that Ms Deaves has exaggerated her attempt to intervene to assist her daughter, a matter which has no bearing on the offender's culpability. 

37The deceased was dressed. The offender told Ms Deaves to wake Tanilla up. The offender grabbed Tanilla by the arm and leg and threw her onto the mattress. 

38Ms Deaves placed Tanilla in a double stroller beside the mattress, in accordance with the subsequent instructions of the offender. She sought to warm her by placing a blanket over her. Tanilla was still breathing. 

39The next morning, Ms Deaves took oldest child to school. They walked. She picked her up in the afternoon and told her that Tanilla was sick. 

40It matters little for the purposes of this exercise, but it seems the events in the shower and the occasioning of the fatal injuries occurred on a Thursday night. Tanilla was left in the pram throughout Thursday night and Friday. 

41It would have been plain to all, and, on the evidence, was plain to both the offender and Ms Deaves, that Tanilla was extremely distressed and ill from the beating. Nevertheless, the child was left in the pram and was not taken for medical attention. 

42Tanilla died early Saturday morning. The medical evidence, adduced during the trial, establishes that the injuries inflicted by the offender as he repeatedly assaulted her were the cause of death. She died of a cerebral haematoma caused by severe haemorrhaging. If medical attention had been sought immediately there was a good chance that the child would have lived, and may not have been permanently affected by the injuries. That chance diminished over the time during which Ms Deaves and the offender left the child unattended. 

43The autopsy revealed significant injuries on the deceased. Most of those injuries do not relate to the infliction of the fatal injuries and I do not take them into account in determining the objective seriousness of the murder for sentencing purposes. 

44The fact, if it be the fact, that Tanilla was kept from day care because of bruising is, it seems to me, totally irrelevant to the sentencing exercise in which I am engaged. That sentencing exercise must concentrate on the infliction of the fatal injuries, the context in which those fatal injuries occurred and the treatment of the deceased after the injuries were inflicted. 

45Nevertheless, I cannot avoid the comment that this family and these children were brought to the attention of authorities. The authorities visited the home. Yet obvious injuries seem not to have caused sufficient alarm to warrant the children being taken from the home. 

46From the foregoing factual conclusions, I find the following matters as relevant to sentence. First and foremost, the victim was a child of two years and eight months in the care of her mother and the offender. Secondly, it was no part of the Crown case that the offender had an intention to kill when he inflicted the injuries. I do find, beyond reasonable doubt, he intended to cause her grievous bodily harm. 

47The circumstances of this case render the distinction between an intention to cause grievous bodily harm and reckless indifference to human life of limited value in terms of the objective seriousness of the offence and the ultimate sentence that would be imposed as a consequence. 

48Nevertheless, I make it clear that I consider the actions of the offender were such that he had an intention to cause grievous bodily harm at the time he committed this offence. 

49I accept that the infliction of the injuries from which the child died were neither planned nor premeditated. Further, notwithstanding the statements recited above as to the colour of the deceased, I do not consider that the injuries were inflicted because of hatred or prejudice against a group of people. 

50In the course of oral submissions, the Court was urged to conclude that the offence was committed in a manner that was ""spontaneous"". I do not consider the infliction of the injuries to be spontaneous. There is a difference between spontaneity, on the one hand, and a lack of planning or premeditation, on the other hand. In this instance, the injuries were unplanned and not premeditated, but the conduct was the culmination of two to three days of the deliberate infliction of severe corporal punishment. 

The Age of the Victim

51The most obvious factor in assessing the objective seriousness of this offence is the age of the victim. As earlier stated, she was two years and eight months of age. The offender was in a position of trust. I accept that the degree of trust reposed in the offender was not as great as the degree of trust reposed in the deceased's natural parent. Nevertheless, the offender was placed in a position of trust, and willingly and knowingly undertook exercised and ultimately abused that trust. 

52The significance of the young age of the victim is a matter of some difficulty in dealing with the principles to be applied. On the one hand, one could not assess the objective culpability of a murder (without any special reference to any particular factor) without having regard to the young age of this victim. Yet, the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 require that I take into account, if the victim were vulnerable, because amongst other things, she was very young. Thirdly, the legislature has fixed a standard non-parole period of twenty-five years' imprisonment in the case of a murder, where the victim is under eighteen years of age. 

53As to the last mentioned matter, I accept that the murder of a child of such tender years, as is the deceased in this case, is a very different offence to the murder of a person who is, say, just under the age of eighteen. Not all minors should be treated the same. Nevertheless, the three separate considerations must be applied in a way that does not double or triple count the factor. 

54There is no doubt this crime is one that is particularly heinous. No person, with any modicum of humanity, could not be moved by the circumstances of this murder. Yet it is necessary for the Court to determine how best to reflect the circumstance of the youth of the victim and the position of trust of the offender by the application of principles. 

55In my view, there is but one offence of murder. The tender age of the victim is a factor which renders, in this case, the objective seriousness of the offence of murder particularly grave. Having considered the age of the victim in that way, I do not further aggravate the offence by the application of the provisions of s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

56Further, I assess the objective seriousness of this offence within the general offence of murder. The circumstance that I have as a guidepost a standard non-parole period of twenty-five years, a standard non-parole period significantly higher than would apply to the murder of an adult, reinforces the legislative intention that the murder of a child is to be treated more seriously than the murder of an adult. In this case, the age of the victim is a significant factor in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and the standard non-parole period guideline, while a guideline in the overall assessment of the sentence to be imposed, has not affected the sentence I would otherwise have imposed. 

57The Crown, in its submissions, pointed out that not all offences that involve an intention to kill are more serious than offences involving an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Such a submission is a truism.

58Nevertheless, in this case, if there were an intention to kill, and all other things remained the same, the offence would be a significantly more serious offence, as a matter of principle. Likewise, if the infliction of the injuries were premeditated and planned (even if the intention was only to cause really serious injury) the offence would be a far more serious one. The lack of all of those factors move the objective seriousness of this offence out of the worst category. 

59It is not that the Court is imagining circumstances that would be a worse case than the one before it. It is that this case, while extremely serious, well above a mid-range of offences of murder and approaching the worst case of murder, is not in that worst category. 

60At this point reference should be made to the provisions of s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provide that a court ""is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence"". 

61I do not consider that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence. In my view, it is appropriate that there be a determinate sentence, holding out the possibility of parole, assuming the offender meets the criteria for its grant. 

Subjective Circumstances

62The offender was born on 2 November 1982. At the time of the offence he was 29 years of age and about to turn 30. He was living with Ms Deaves and her three children. He was receiving a Newstart Allowance and collecting and selling scrap metal. 

63The relationship with Ms Deaves was rendered more difficult by the relationship between her and her family, about which the Court has heard. 

64The offender had a history of minor injuries, which are of little or no moment. He gives a history of having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and high-level personality disorder. He was medicated on Seroquel and was medicated at or around the time of the offence. 

65The offender smokes tobacco. At the time he was examined by two psychiatrists he was medicated on 100mg of Seroquel (slow-release). 

66He had a history of drug use. He started smoking cannabis around the age of eleven or twelve and by the age of fifteen or sixteen he was using amphetamines. He stopped using amphetamines just before he was incarcerated in 2006 and has not used them since that time. Nevertheless, he remained a heavy smoker of cannabis and part of the facts, earlier stated, refer to his smoking just before or during the occasioning of the injuries that caused death. 

67His parents were separated when he was three. He gives no history of dysfunction in his early family life. His older brother is a police officer in country New South Wales and his younger brother works in construction.

68He was born and raised in Gosford and had significant difficulties associated with the absence of his mother after the divorce. His father remarried and he had great difficulty with his stepmother. His father and stepmother obtained an Apprehended Violence Order against him at the age of twelve and he was, at that point in time, kicked out the home and lived in a refuge. 

69For a short time he worked in construction and/or as a removalist, but most of the time he was either obtaining Newstart Allowance or working as a scrap metal collector or both. He had a number of relationships. He has a ten year old son who lives with the child's mother. He had a second relationship from which he has an eight year old daughter who is being cared for by the offender's mother. 

70The offender is a non-association prisoner. He has been involved in fights while in remand, partly, he says, as a result of the offence of which he has been convicted and the alleged contacts of the deceased's father. 

71He has a criminal history involving break, enter and steal motor vehicles, common assaults, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and is not entitled to the leniency that might otherwise be afforded a person with no criminal offence history. 

72As to his mental state, the opinion of Dr Westmore, who was qualified by the offender, is to the effect that there is nothing in his history to suggest that a psychiatric illness played any role in the matters of which he has been convicted. Nor is there anything to suggest that he is currently acutely mentally ill. He does describe seeing the deceased and hearing her voice, but the psychiatrists take the view that they are not of psychotic origin and are a form of bereavement. That assumes that the experiences are real, i.e. that the offender actually does see and hear the deceased. 

73He has some intellectual difficulties and underlying personality problems but essentially his offending comes down to his anti-social qualities. The general import of the opinion of Dr Westmore was confirmed by Dr Skinner, who was qualified by the Crown. 

74The offender is of Aboriginal background. There is nothing before the Court to suggest that his childhood or upbringing was in any way dysfunctional or that he suffered discrimination on account of his Aboriginality. None of the factors associated with the principles in Fernando are, on the evidence before the Court, applicable to the offender. 

75Lastly, I turn to the issues rehabilitation and remorse. It must be said that there is nothing before the Court to suggest any remorse by the offender. 

76The offender submitted a statement to the Court, although he did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. That statement does not express any regret for any conduct associated with these offences. Partly, that is explicable by the fact that the offender continues to assert his innocence and denies that he inflicted the fatal injuries. 

77However, the statement does not even express regret at the death of the deceased; nor remorse or regret at failing to take the deceased for medical attention. I consider that no remorse is evident. Further, I consider that while there is a possibility of rehabilitation, if appropriate courses were undertaken, the prospects of rehabilitation are poor. 

78There are no significant subjective factors that ameliorate the seriousness of the offence or that warrant any form of leniency. 

Conclusion 

79As already stated, I have determined that the objective seriousness of the offence is not one that brings it in the worst category of offences of murder. Nevertheless, I have concluded that it is one that approaches the worst category of case for which a significant but determinate sentence should be imposed. I have taken into account each of the eleven cases in which a person has been sentenced for murder of a young child. No two cases are identical. Nor do I consider that the eleven cases constitute a ""range"" that mandates, or is indicative of, a particular outcome. 

80Bearing in mind all of the factors to which I have made reference, I consider that a head sentence of 40 years' imprisonment is an appropriate sentence. The length of that sentence means that there will be sufficient time, assuming parole were granted, for the offender to reinforce in the community any rehabilitation that may have occurred in prison. I do not find special circumstances. 

81The offender, has been incarcerated, for this offence, since 27 September 2011 and the sentence will commence on that date. 

Sentence

82Warren James Ross, you are convicted that on or about 27 August 2011, at Watanobbi in the State of New South Wales, you did murder Tanilla Warrick-Deaves. 

83I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 30 years, commencing 27 September 2011 and concluding 26 September 2041, the balance of term being a further 10 years, expiring on 26 September 2051. 

84You are first eligible for release on 26 September 2041.

2764037,R v Armstrong [2014] NSWSC 700,"Judgment
Introduction
1On 9 April 2014 the offender, Paul Armstrong, was arraigned on an indictment dated 8 April 2014 charging him with the murder of Felipe Flores at Woolloomooloo on 2 September 1991 and the felonious slaying of Felipe Flores. On 9 April 2014 the offender entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter which was accepted in full discharge of the indictment. The basis on which the plea was accepted was manslaughter by reason of provocation.
2Prior to the entry of the plea, the trial by jury of the offender had been set down to commence on 7 April 2014. 
The Facts
3The facts on the basis of which the offender is to be sentenced are derived substantially from the statement of agreed facts, which was signed by the offender and the Crown Prosecutor on 9 April 2014 (the Agreed Facts), from which the following narrative is taken. There are some matters that are not agreed and which have been the subject of evidence. Separate findings will be made in respect of disputed facts.
4As sentencing judge, I may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the offender unless the facts have been agreed or established beyond reasonable doubt, but if there are circumstances which I propose to take into account in favour of the offender it is sufficient that they be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ.
Narrative based on Agreed Facts
5Felipe Flores, who was born in 1964, was infected by the HIV virus at the time he migrated to Australia from Ecuador in 1988. He was homosexual and was known to frequent gay nightclubs and establishments in the Darlinghurst area. At the time of his death, he lived with Betsy De Leon in a unit at Kensington.
6Mr Flores told John Goosen, a friend, that he had HIV. Mr Goosen was worried about Mr Flores because he had not been in the country for long, had difficulty with the English language and did not seem to know much about HIV. Mr Goosen was concerned that he may spread AIDS to sexual partners and told him that he should inform sexual partners that he had HIV.
7Mr Flores spent the afternoon of 1 September 1991 with a friend, Philip Ovando. Later that evening they attended the Albury Hotel, Darlinghurst, with friends. Shortly after midnight on 2 September 1991, Mr Flores went to the Exchange Hotel on Oxford Street, Darlinghurst where he consumed alcohol and was observed to be intoxicated.  About 2.40am, Mr Flores left the Exchange Hotel with a male friend, Rurick Ortiz-Finol, and went to a nearby ATM where he attempted, unsuccessfully, to withdraw money from his bank account. 
8The offender was also at the Exchange Hotel. Between 1991 and 1994 he lived, worked and received medical attention in the Darlinghurst area. Shortly after returning to the Exchange Hotel, Mr Flores left his group of friends and began talking to the offender, who was taller than 185cm, Caucasian in appearance and had a solid muscular build. They agreed to have a sexual liaison. 
9After a short conversation with the offender, Mr Flores returned to one of his friends, Rene Mock-Robertson, who described him as acting ""excited"" as if he had just ""picked up"" the male. Mr Flores returned to the offender and they continued talking. Mr Flores' friends then left the hotel. This was the last time they saw Mr Flores alive.
10After they had left the Exchange Hotel, the offender drove Mr Flores in his cream-coloured 1972 Holden Station Wagon to a secluded spot at Lincoln Crescent, Woolloomooloo. At that time Lincoln Crescent, which is about 1.5 kms from the Exchange Hotel, was known to be used as a 'lovers' lane'. There, oral sex between them took place during which the deceased's trousers and underpants were lowered. During or after oral sex the deceased told the offender that he was HIV positive. At the time the offender had a fear of contracting HIV. He lost control as a result of what was said and from concern as to the possibility of contracting HIV. He violently assaulted the deceased with such force that Mr Flores suffered fatal injuries which are described below. The offender then dragged Mr Flores a short distance to an area of dirt at the end of Lincoln Crescent and left the scene in his station wagon. 
11At the time the offender assaulted Mr Flores he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. When he left the deceased he knew he was seriously injured but thought he was still alive. The next day, and some months afterwards, the offender saw doctors to find out if he had contracted the HIV virus.  
12The Crown accepts that on the evidence the offender's loss of control was induced by Mr Flores' words which were said during or immediately after sexual contact and which affected the offender. In 1991 there was considerable fear in the community as to the effects on a person who contracted HIV. There was also concern and confusion as to the ways in which the virus may be contracted. In 1991, the effect of an ordinary person learning of possible exposure to the virus would be very different than it would be today where more is known of the virus and the ways in which it can be contracted and where treatments are significantly more effective. The Crown accepts that, taking into account the community concern in 1991 as to contracting HIV, it could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost self-control as to have formed the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm.
13Robert Small, a security guard, began patrolling the wharf area in Woolloomooloo near Lincoln Crescent shortly after 2.30am. He had first seen a white tabletop truck near an electricity substation at Wharf 11, near Lincoln Crescent. He heard a male voice nearby saying ""do you think he saw us"". He continued to patrol the Wharf to its northern end. Some time between 2.30 and 3.00a.m. he heard an alarm sounding from the direction of the Woolloomooloo Hotel. As he walked towards the hotel he saw a light cream-coloured early model Ford or Holden station wagon with one door painted in a different colour on the road close to the substation. The vehicle was the one the offender had used to drive Mr Flores to the location and in which he drove away from the scene.
14Mr. Small went to a hotel near the southern end of the wharf. When he returned to his office, which was on the wharf, he saw the truck drive off. He then saw a patrolling security car with a spotlight drive along the road and leave. From the northern end of the wharf he heard what sounded like a 'huh' sound, as if someone was out of breath. He then heard a sound from the fenced area near the middle of the wharf and saw a male, who was the offender, go to the driver's door of the cream coloured station wagon, get in and drive off. He saw the car make a u-turn and then drive south, without its headlights on. 
15Shortly before 3.38am Mr Small checked the power substation and found Mr Flores nearby in a park, lying on his back, naked from the waist down with his jeans and underpants around his ankles and pulled over his shoes. This was the location that Mr Small had seen the male walk from before getting into the station wagon and driving away. Mr Small observed some movement in the eyes of Mr Flores consistent with his still being alive.
16By the time ambulance officers arrived at about 3.50am Mr Flores had died. Police arrived at about 4.00am and immediately established a crime scene.
17Forensic examiners ascertained that the body had apparently been dragged a short distance into the position where it had been found. Detective Khoudair took photographs of the deceased and of his clothing. 14 photographs are annexed and form part of the facts. Detective Khoudair and the forensic pathologist, Ms Schwartz, both observed a patterned injury to the head consistent with a shoe.
18On 3 September 1991 a post mortem was carried out. It was noted during the examination that Mr Flores had suffered severe internal injuries. These included three fractured ribs on the right side and two on the left side and a large laceration extending between both atria of the heart. Both lungs were congested and had areas of contusions. The diaphragm had extensive bruising. There was a large laceration to the liver which almost split the liver in half. There was bruising to the spleen. There was also extensive bruising to the scrotum and a laceration to the groin area. An impression was also noted on the deceased's face which is believed to be a shoe print. The death was attributed to 'multiple injuries'.
19During the post mortem a number of exhibits were seized for further examination, including clothing, tissue and other samples taken from the body including fingernail clippings from both the left and right hand of the deceased.
20Detective Sergeant Barker from the Homicide Unit was the Officer in Charge of the Investigation from 1991 until 1995. In 1995 Coroner Abernathy conducted an inquest into Mr Flores' death and found that he died on 2 September 1991 at Woolloomooloo of multiple injuries inflicted by a person or persons unknown.
21No one was arrested or charged in relation to the death of Felipe Flores either during the initial investigation or after the inquest.
22In 2008, police from the Unsolved Homicide Team reviewed the investigation into Mr Flores' death. Further forensic examinations and analyses were undertaken as a result of which DNA material was located from Mr Flores' fingernails. DNA profiles were obtained from fingernail clippings from both hands.
23There was a major DNA profile of an unknown male in a mixture on a fingernail on the right hand, which was expected to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 billion individuals in the general population. The minor profile of the same unknown male was located on a fingernail on the left hand, which was expected to occur in 1 in 430 million individuals in the general population.
24In 2008, the DNA profile of the unknown male person recovered from the fingernails was then matched on National Criminal Identification DNA Database with the offender's profile. Enquiries revealed the offender was then residing in Tasmania. As a result, further investigations began into the involvement of the offender in Mr Flores' death.
25Further forensic examinations were conducted and it was later found that the offender's DNA profile was the same partial profile as that recovered from Mr Flores' shirt, which is expected to occur in 1 in 860 individuals in the general population. It was also discovered that the offender had the same DNA profile as a minor mixture recovered from another fingernail on the left hand, which is expected to occur in 1 in 580 thousand individuals in the general population.
26On 3 September 1991, the day after the offender killed Mr Flores, he attended 'Immediate Health Care' and was seen by an attending medical practitioner. In February 1992 the offender attended another medical practitioner and samples were taken for testing for sexually transmitted diseases.
27Inquiries with the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority revealed that the offender was the registered owner of motor vehicle GAA 316 which was a cream-coloured 1972 Holden station wagon. Further records disclosed that the same vehicle received various parking tickets when it was parked from 16 September 1991 to 30 October 1991 on Waine Street, Surry Hills, which is a short distance from the Exchange Hotel.
28On 4 December 2008, the offender attended the Launceston Police Station and agreed to an electronically recorded interview with police. The offender acknowledged in the interview that in 1991 he was bisexual, that he had had casual sexual relations with other males and that he used to frequent the Exchange Hotel. During the interview the offender was shown a photo of a man whom he was informed was Mr Flores. The offender said that he could not recall ever having seen the person before, including in any casual sexual relationship. The offender offered no explanation when he was told that his DNA profile had been recovered from under the fingernails of the deceased.  In the course of the interview, the offender denied reading any publicity about the murder and denied ever going to Lincoln Crescent Woolloomooloo.
29Following the interview, the offender was arrested, charged with murder and extradited to New South Wales.
30On 24 December 2008, Detectives Hungerford and Packham visited the offender at Parklea Detention Centre. During the visit the offender made ""off the record"" admissions to Detective Hungerford, that implicated him in Mr Flores' death. The offender said to Detective Hungerford:""If I was to tell you off the record that him and I went down there and had oral sex and he then told me that he had HIV and I just lost it and bashed him. I did not mean to kill him and I left him there he was still alive. What would happen to me then?""
31Detective Hungerford asked why he did not say this in the earlier interview and the offender said:""I was taking legal advice and if you remember when it got to the question about the murder I said no comment.""
32Detective Hungerford asked how he knew the person had died and the offender said:""I heard it on the news.""
33When Detective Hungerford said he wanted to record what the offender had just said the offender said:-""No I am not speaking on camera until I speak with my lawyer Iam not signing anything until I speak with my lawyer or talking about it anymore until I talk to my lawyer. I will talk to you after I have spoken to my lawyer.""
34Detective Hungerford informed the offender that he had arranged with Corrective Services to see him on 28 January 2009. On 20 January 2009 Detective Hungerford returned a call from the offender's legal representative who told him that the offender was not prepared to speak to him and that the appointment for the 28 January should be cancelled. 
35In September 2009, investigating police located Jacinta Webber. Ms Webber had lived with the offender from February 1991 until early October 1991 at which time she had been a male and her name had been Stephan Webber.
36On 15 September 2009, a statement was taken from Ms Webber. In that statement Ms Webber said that close to the end of the time they were living together the offender came home in the early hours of the morning. She described his appearance at the time he arrived home. Ms Webber gave evidence in March 2010 at the offender's trial (which resulted in a conviction that was later quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal) as to the occasion and her observations. The offender disputes the evidence.
37On 29 September 2009, in a further statement, Ms Webber outlined that in the two or three weeks following the morning the offender returned home, there had been an article in the ""Star Observer"" newspaper concerning the bashing murder of a gay male in the Woolloomooloo area, near Mrs Macquarie's chair. The report stated that there had been a number of murders of gay men in the then recent past. Ms Webber set out in the statement conversations she had with the offender on that occasion. Ms. Webber recalled that the conversations with the offender were in September 1991. Ms Webber gave evidence in the trial of the occasion and the conversations. The offender disputes the evidence.
38Ms. Webber gave the following evidence at court about the offender: ""Paul's biggest fear back in those days was the HIV AIDS virus. Before we started a relationship we both had HIV tests.""
39Ms. Webber was aware that the offender's brother, Jamie, was diagnosed with HIV AIDS in March 1988.
Disputed Facts
40A principal disputed fact is whether, as the Crown contended, the offender appreciated that he had killed Mr Flores either at the time or shortly after his death or, as the offender contended, he was unaware that he had killed Mr Flores until he was contacted by Detective Hungerford in Tasmania in December 2008. The other disputed facts are those derived from Ms Webber's evidence set out above.
41The Crown adduced the following evidence on the disputed facts:
(1)The transcript of evidence given by Jacinta Webber at the trial;
(2)Trial exhibit O, being two photographs of the offender;
(3)The transcript of evidence given by Detective Hungerford at the trial;
(4)Excerpts from the transcript of the recorded interview with the offender on 18 December 2008;
(5)Part of trial exhibit AC which comprised photographs and the offender's Medicare history;
(6)Trial exhibit AE, being the offender's medical records from June 1991;
(7)Trial exhibit AF being newspaper reports regarding the death of Mr Flores;
(8)Three certificates of analysis of Dr David Bruce dated 19 February 2009, 25 March 2009 and 28 March 2014.
(9)Transcript of a recorded telephone call between the offender and his father on 6 April 2009.
42Ms Webber was not required for cross-examination at the sentence hearing.
43The offender relied on the following evidence on the disputed facts:
(1)Transcript of evidence given at the inquest and at the trial by Dr Liliana Schwartz, a forensic pathologist who examined the deceased at the place of his death in Woolloomooloo and also conducted an autopsy on his body, together with a diagram prepared by her of injuries to the deceased.
(2)Transcript of evidence given at the trial by Detective Khoudair as to the mechanism by which the injuries sustained by the deceased were inflicted.
(3)An extract of a statement dated 2 September 1991 of Betsy De Leon, who lived with the deceased, in which she deposed that the deceased was not an aggressive man who was not a good fighter.
(4)An extract of evidence given at the trial by Royce Lockhart who was a good friend of the deceased who deposed that the deceased did not respond physically, was not a good fighter and was of slim to medium build and 5' 6"" or 5' 7"" tall.
(5)An extract of evidence given at the trial by Philip Ovando who deposed to the deceased's intention on the night he was killed to stay at the Exchange and have a good time as he intended not to go to work the next day.
(6)An extract of evidence given at the trial by Rurick Otriz-Finol as to the deceased being intoxicated on the night he was killed.
(7)Two statements given to police by Ms Webber dated 15 September 2009 and 29 September 2009.
(8)Ms Webber's Medicare records.
(9)Detective Hungerford's notes relating to Ms Webber dated 9 September and 21 September 2009.
(10)A publication entitled ""Yamba Floodplain Risk Management Study"" which indicated that there was no flood in Yamba in 2005.
44Ms Webber was born in 1968 and was about 23 in September 1991 and 42 at the time of the trial. She changed her name to Jacinta some time in 1994. She was in an intimate relationship with the offender in 1991. She was aware that he was not faithful to her. She was not aware that the offender had a car. Indeed she tried to talk him out of acquiring one. They separated in late 1991 and did not stay in contact after that.  
45Ms Webber gave evidence at trial that she saw the offender come home with marking on his clothing on only one occasion which she said was in about September 1991. His clothing had blood on it, his shirt was ripped and there were scratch marks on the side of his face and also on his chest. Ms Webber particularly remembered the occasion because she had given the offender the shirt that had been damaged and it had cost $120. The offender told her that he had been involved in a fight with one of the patrons at work.
46Ms Webber also gave evidence that she had seen an article about a gay murder in Woolloomooloo in the Sydney Star Observer, which came out fortnightly during that period. She drew it to the offender's attention and said, ""Look, another gay murder."" She explained her comment as follows:""Back in the late 80s, early 90s, there was a lot of gay bashings and murders going on."" 
47Ms Webber gave evidence that the offender did not respond to the comment. However, about a couple of weeks after that conversation, they were having an argument and the offender told her that he had hurt someone pretty badly in Woolloomooloo but when he had left, the man was still alive. Ms Webber said that this second conversation, which took place in September 1991, occurred only a couple of weeks after the offender had come home with blood on his shirt and scratch marks. She gave evidence that she had never mentioned the second conversation to anyone until police contacted her in 2009. When she was asked why she did not do anything about the conversation she said:""Paul made a threat against me and my family. He said that he had already killed one man and there was nothing stopping him from killing somebody else, let alone me or my family, and when Paul made a threat, he was serious.""
48Ms Webber said that the offender had made the threat in September 1991. 
49The Crown tendered three articles from the Sydney Star Observer that concerned the death of the deceased. The first, which had the headline, ""Seventh gay murder: witnesses sought"" read in part:Police are seeking witnesses for what is understood to be the seventh gay murder in Sydney in less than three years.In the early hours of Monday morning, 2 September, the body of Felipe Marcelo Flores, 27, was found by a security guard in Woolloomooloo.Flores had been bashed and kicked to death and was found with his jeans pulled down around his ankles with no money or identification.Detective Sergeant Brian Barker of Sydney South Police said that the security guard approached the location at about 3.30 am after hearing noises.  As the guard approached, he saw a light coloured station wagon drive away.The exact location was at the end of Lincoln Cres, between Wharf 11 and the Boy Charlton Pool.Flores of Kensington was last seen by friends at the Exchange Hotel at about 2.30 am.He left the venue without notifying friends.Police want to talk with anyone who may have seen Flores leave the Exchange, or at any stage during the evening....Police believe Flores went to the murder location by car or taxi, as he was found dead only 45 minutes after he was last seen by friends.We believe he went willingly to a certain point and he may have gone with a stranger to this particular secluded spot, Barker said. Police believe the motive was robbery, as Flores was found with no money or identification.It is difficult to make it known if it was a sexual attack or poofter bashing.It has all the earmarks [sic] of a gay murder.. . .

50The second article from the Sydney Star Observer was published on 4 October 1991 with the headline ""Lead on Flores murder"". The article contained a further request for information and a contact number on which to contact police.
51The third article from the Sydney Star Observer was published on page 4 of the issue dated 18 October 1991. The headline, ""Police plea on mystery murder"" preceded the following paragraph:""Police have made a plea to the gay community to come forward with any information on the murder of Felipe Flores.""
52The article repeated the basic facts from the earlier article and concluded with a contact number for a named police officer.
53The fourth article from the Sydney Star Observer was published on page 4 with the headline: ""North Coast Murder Clue"". It contained a report from two men who had observed men behaving suspiciously in the Exchange Hotel on 2 September 1991. The article said in part:""The men who come to Sydney from time to time said they have seen a group of men who looked like football players acting suspiciously at the Exchange. They told me the guys they have seen are homophobes and each one stands in a different corner of the venue and tries to attract other guys.""
54The Crown also tendered a press release dated 3 September 1991 issued by the police headed ""Detectives Seek Assistance in Flores Murder Inquiry"", as well as articles from the mainstream press, including a short article headed ""Wharf Murder"" from the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 September 1991 and a longer article from the same publication on the following day headed: ""Police suspect 7th gay murder"". The Crown also tendered two articles from the Daily Telegraph Mirror. The first, dated 3 September 1991, had the headline, ""Grisly pool find: man battered dead"", and the second, dated 4 September 1991, was headed ""Murder a Mystery"" and published a photograph of the deceased. 
55Detective Hungerford had learned of Ms Webber's existence and relationship with the offender through the interview he had conducted with the offender in 2008 and as a result of records that showed they were the joint owners of a motor vehicle. 
56In September 2009, when Detective Hungerford first spoke to Ms Webber, he told her that Paul Armstrong had been arrested for the murder of Mr Flores who had died on 2 September 1991.  Detective Hungerford did not give Ms Webber any details about how Mr Flores was killed or that he was HIV positive although he did tell her where the offence had occurred. He asked her if she knew anything. At the trial her evidence was:""I said 'Detective Hungerford, leave it with me for a couple of days,' because 20 years is a long time to remember, and I'd phone him back.""
57Ms Webber spoke to Detective Hungerford on the phone a couple of times and then met him about a week later at a police station out of New South Wales, where she gave a statement to police dated 15 September 2009. At the end of the interview, she told him that if she remembered any more she would contact him. There were further telephone conversations between them including one that occurred on the evening of 15 September 2009 in which Ms Webber told Detective Hungerford that there were no further conversations with the offender apart from the one about what had happened when he returned with the torn shirt. 
58On 21 September 2009, Ms Webber mentioned the Star Observer article for the first time to Detective Hungerford and told him about the second conversation. Ms Webber gave evidence at the trial that she did not recall the second conversation until some time after she had spoken with him on the evening of 15 September 2009.
59When she told Detective Hungerford about the second conversation, Ms Webber was worried that she would be in trouble for not having gone to police earlier and raised the issue with Detective Hungerford, who told her that he did not think she would be in trouble. Nonetheless Ms Webber asked for an immunity. Later on 21 September 2009, Ms Webber rang Detective Hungerford again. She had been drinking and was intoxicated. She told him that she was fearful and wanted to change her telephone number and that she would notify him of her new number.
60On 29 September 2009 Ms Webber gave a second statement in which she set out the conversation about the article in the Sydney Star Observer and the threats made by the offender to her. The version she gave in that statement was:I said to Paul, ""Another gay murder at Woolloomooloo.""  He said, ""I hurt a man very badly in that area that night, but when I left, the man was still alive.""   (I did not question Paul about this further (sic) about this comment he made.  I never questioned Paul about anything as I was scared of Paul and I am still scared of Paul today.  Whenever I had questioned Paul in the past it always  ended up in an argument and I felt intimidated by his standover manner so I never questioned him.)  A few hours later the same day Paul and I were having a heated argument about something.  I cannot recall what it was about.  But Paul said, ""I killed one guy and there is nothing stopping me from killing you or another member of your family if you ever talk about what I told you before.""  Shortly after this Paul went to work.
61Ms Webber explained in her evidence at the trial that she felt obliged to make the second statement because of what she had remembered, although she was afraid that she might get into trouble for revealing what she had been told by the offender, because she thought that it might make her an accessory. These two statements were tendered on behalf of the offender at the sentence hearing.
62In the second statement, Ms Webber said that she remembered that the second conversation had occurred in September because she was the victim of a sexual assault in September which occurred between the time the offender came home with blood on his shirt and the time the offender told her he had hurt a man very badly. She said that she recorded the sexual assault in her diary but it had been destroyed in a flood in Yamba in about 2005. She gave evidence at the trial that she had not told the offender about the sexual assault because he would have blamed her. In the second statement Ms Webber said that she did not record the conversation with the offender in her diary in case he read her diary. In her evidence at trial she said that this had been incorrectly recorded and that she had said that she had recorded the second conversation in her diary.
63In the trial, Ms Webber was cross-examined about the occasion on which she was sexually assaulted in 1991. She said that she went to the doctor a couple of days after the assault. She was shown her Medicare records that recorded consultations on 5 May 1991, 26 May 1991, 27 May 1991, 2 June 1991, 30 July 1991, 6 August 1991, 30 October 1991 and visits on 4, 5 and 11 November 1991. No visits were recorded between 6 August and 30 October 1991. Ms Webber was adamant that the sexual assault had occurred in September 1991 and that she had sought medical attention for it in that month.
64At the trial it was also put to Ms Webber that the offender had come home with a bloodied shirt on 2 June 1991. Ms Webber was certain that there had only been one such occasion and it had occurred in September 1991. When the offender's medical records were put to her that showed that he had suffered injuries to his face on 2 June 1991, Ms Webber repeated that it was her recollection that it occurred in September 1991. Ms Webber admitted that she was a recovering alcoholic.
The offender's evidence on the disputed facts at the sentence hearing
The record of interview in December 2008
65In his record of interview in December 2008 the offender told police that he had been in a relationship that lasted for five years with Peter Wallis, with whom he co-habited for that period, which ended in late 1995. The offender denied that he had access to a motor vehicle while he was in Sydney.  
66Police asked the offender about various places where he had lived. Among the addresses put to him was Unit 69/219 Chalmers Street, Strawberry Hills. The offender said in response:""Yes, I lived there with a friend who I can't remember now. It's a two-bedroom place.""
67The offender told police that he was not ""seeing"" the man he was living with in Strawberry Hills. He said that he was seeing someone called Steven or Stefan but he could not remember his surname. The police then put to the offender that he had a Holden Station Wagon that was registered in his name jointly with S J Webber. The offender said that he did not remember much about the car and did not recall Mr Webber, as he then was, having anything to do with the registration.
68The police then put a series of photographs to the offender who identified Stefan Webber in the photographs and also identified the unit in Chalmers Street, Strawberry Hills.
69The offender denied ever going to Lincoln Crescent, Woolloomooloo but said that he had been to the Domain and the Botanical Gardens and the Woolloomooloo Bay Hotel for dinner a couple of times when he was living in Potts Point.
70The police put the offender's Medicare records to the offender and asked him about the consultation that occurred on 3 September 1991, the day after Mr Flores was killed. He was asked whether he recalled why he went to the doctor on that day. At first he said that he had no idea. Then he said:""Oh, or do I. I think Peter and I had an altercation where I actually cut there.""
71The offender then showed police a cut mark on his hand and explained that he and Mr Wallis had been having fish and chips and had an argument as a result of which the offender had brought his hand down on the hand towel rack and cut his hand.
72It was an Agreed Fact that in the recorded interview in Tasmania in 2008 the offender was questioned in relation to his DNA profile being recovered from under the fingernails of the deceased but could offer no explanation. The topic of DNA was raised after the offender had given the explanation, which I find to be false, about cutting his hand on the towel rail in September 1991.
The intercepted telephone conversation between the offender and his father on 6 April 2009
73The Crown relied on a transcript of a telephone conversation between the offender and his father on 6 April 2009 in the course of which the offender told his father about the weight of the DNA evidence against him. The following exchange then ensued: 
Accused According to my lawyer the only thing they have is the DNA so my lawyer is going to check out what type it is, the validity of it how it was stored for the last 17 to 18 years.Peter Oh right, yeah they might had nothing on you then mater.Accused Yeah they probably want to strike up a bargain, like drop it from Murder down to Manslaughter.Peter  You are not having that are you.Accused Well we have not plead anything yet, because we do not know the strength of the DNA.Peter  You won't plead guilty to nothing at the momentAccused NoPeter  NoAccused Because when Hungerford came out I told him hypothetically if I did this rather, rather, rather he wanted to put that down on video tape and I said not until I have spoken to my lawyer, that was Christmas Eve.  He then went on and wrote it in his notebook after he left the jail and got his mate to sign the bottom of it to say I was cautioned and that did a hypothetical rather, rather, rather and that was a load of crap.
The offender's evidence about the disputed facts in the sentence hearing
74The offender gave evidence in the sentence hearing that after he and Mr Flores had performed fellatio on each other, they were both lying on the ground. Mr Flores still had his trousers and underwear down below his knees. The offender was dressed but was not wearing his shoes as it was warm. At this point Mr Flores told him that he had contracted the HIV virus which the offender considered to amount to a death sentence imposed on him. His immediate response was to consider how long he would live, whether he would be walking around like a human skeleton and how he would manage without his family. He became very angry and picked up a shoe and started hitting Mr Flores around the face and head with it. Mr Flores tried to cover his face. The offender, who then weighed more than 100 kgs, then ""jumped"" on his chest twice with his buttocks. He said that he squatted on his chest because he ""just wanted to knock the wind out of him."" He said that he did not intend to damage his internal organs.
75The offender gave evidence that he then lifted Mr Flores up by his arms and dragged him along the ground to a darker place because he was concerned that if anyone had come across Mr Flores in his state of undress Mr Flores would have been embarrassed. Mr Flores was groaning at the time. The offender said in cross-examination that he did not think of pulling Mr Flores' trousers up to cover his private parts.
76The offender then drove home. The offender gave evidence that there was no blood on his shirt. He did not discuss what had occurred with anyone and in particular he did not discuss the matter with Ms Webber, with whom he was then living in a relationship. He did not recall discussing with Ms Webber an article in the Sydney Star Observer about gay bashings and homicides, although he accepted that he may have.
77The offender said that he first became aware that Mr Flores had died when he spoke with Detective Hungerford in Tasmania on 4 December 2008. When Detective Hungerford showed him a photograph of Mr Flores he did not recognise him.
78The offender's counsel, Mr Nicholson SC, put to the offender the evidence he had given at the trial. He put that he had been asked in the trial whether in 1991 he was very frightened about coming into contact with the HIV virus, he answered, ""No, I wasn't"". The following exchange then took place in the sentence hearing:Q.  Well, what do you say now about whether you were frightened about the HIV virus? A.  I wasn't frightened, I was terrified.Q.  So what do you say about the answer you gave, or at least the answer that is recorded as you giving, that you were not frightened? A.  Correct, correct.
79When Mr Armstrong was asked by his counsel whether he had thought about Mr Flores' death at any point since his involvement in it, he gave the following responses:""I was actually shattered to find out that I was actually the cause of somebody's death.""
""I've thought of nothing else since I found out that I was the cause of Mr Flores' death.""
""My moods go up and down.  I have had a couple of states of depression.  There are some nights where I close my eyes and I actually see the picture of the deceased.""
80The following exchange also occurred with his counsel:Q.  Is your regret a self-centred regret, that is because it sees you locked up and so on, is that the focus of your regret? A.  No.  My regret is that Mr Flores didn't have the time to spend with his family and then I took him away from his family.
81The offender was cross-examined about the apparent inconsistency between his statement in the Agreed Facts that he knew that Mr Flores had died because he had heard it on the news and his evidence at the sentence hearing that he only found out that Mr Flores had died when Detective Hungerford spoke with him in Tasmania in 2008. The offender said that he meant by ""news"" that he had heard it on the grapevine because the police had first contacted his father.
82At the sentence hearing, the offender sought to explain the evidence he had given on oath at the trial in which he denied his involvement in Mr Flores' death by saying:""Yes, I denied it, because I didn't want to admit it to myself."" 

The offender's credibility
83The offender was an unsatisfactory witness. He began with the obvious difficulty that his plea to manslaughter directly contradicted what he had told police in the recorded interview on 18 December 2008 as well as his evidence on oath at the trial that he had not left the Exchange Hotel with Mr Flores and that he had not had anything to do with his killing. His defence at trial had been conducted on the positive basis that it was someone else who had killed Mr Flores.
84I do not accept anything the offender said unless it was corroborated or amounted to a statement against interest. He has shown a repeated preparedness to lie in what he perceived to be his interests at the time.  The inconsistencies between what he told Detective Hungerford in the recorded interview and what he told him in the ""off the record"" component, which was corroborated by what he told his father in the telephone conversation in April 2009, are an example of this.  The inconsistency between his plea and his evidence before me on the one hand and the sworn evidence he gave in his defence at the trial on the other are another example. 
85The offender's dishonesty is evident from the deliberately false evidence he gave at the trial including:
(1)His denial that he took Mr Flores to Woolloomooloo in his car;
(2)His denial that he had sex with Mr Flores at Woolloomooloo;
(3)His denial that he assaulted Mr Flores;
(4)His evidence that he was blasé about the possibility of contracting AIDS.
86The explanation he gave in re-examination in the sentence hearing as to his false evidence that ""I was in self-denial"" was deliberately untrue. It was also inconsistent with his admission, also in re-examination, that when he spoke to his father in April 2009 in the recorded telephone conversation, he intended to acknowledge ""publicly"" (at least to his father) that he had caused Mr Flores' death.
87The offender's aptitude for semantic pedantry was demonstrated by his statement that it was true that he was not scared of AIDS on the basis that he was terrified. However, this was insufficient to explain why he had given false evidence at the trial that he was blasé about the risk of AIDS. In my view his evidence that he was blasé about AIDS was false evidence that was given to make the jury believe that he would not have lost control of himself had Mr Flores told him that he was HIV positive after they had had sex. His attempt to explain that piece of false evidence by saying, in his evidence at the sentence hearing, that he was not brought up by his mother to show his vulnerable side and that it was ""my business, not the court's"", ""I'm a very private person.  I don't let people into the real me"" was, in my view, wholly disingenuous.  He was, in fact, scared of AIDS, although he did little to minimise his risk of infection.
88The offender's opportunism in accommodating or explaining apparently prior inconsistent statements was also demonstrated by his insistence that when he told Detective Hungerford that he knew that Mr Flores had died because he had heard it on the news he was actually referring to hearing ""the news"" from his father that Detective Hungerford wanted to speak with him.  I am satisfied that ""the news"" which informed him of Mr Flores' death was either broadcast or published in September 1991.
89I regard the offender's evidence that the reason he dragged Mr Flores to a dark place was to protect him from embarrassment as not only absurd but also redolent with sophistry. I am satisfied to the requisite standard that the offender dragged Mr Flores to a dark place so that he would not be discovered in sufficient time for the offender to be associated with the assault perpetrated on him.
90I am satisfied that when the offender was interviewed by police in December 2008 he was consciously trying to lay a false trail by referring to his relationship with Mr Wallis which he said lasted for five years and covered the relevant period. He understood the need to explain Stefan Webber's existence when confronted with the registration papers which recorded him as a joint registered owner of a motor vehicle. His reference to the unit in Strawberry Hills as having two bedrooms was misleading; his denial that he and the man he was living with were in an intimate relationship was deliberately false, as was his statement in the recorded interview that he could not remember who he was living with at that address. The Strawberry Hills unit was where he lived with Ms Webber. There was no issue about this since his counsel at the trial put to Ms Webber that they had moved to Strawberry Hills in about October 1991. I infer that the motive for the falsehoods was that the offender knew full well that Ms Webber was capable of implicating him in Mr Flores' death because of the admissions he had made to her at the time. I do not accept his evidence that he did not regard himself as having anything to fear from the police contacting Ms Webber.
91I am not satisfied that the offender had sex with Mr Flores at the Exchange Hotel before they left for Woolloomooloo in the car. The offender was unable to explain how his DNA came to be on the deceased's fingernails at the recorded interview. I am satisfied that he fabricated the suggestion that he had had sex with Mr Flores at the Exchange Hotel in order to explain the presence of his DNA on Mr Flores' fingernails which formed a basis for a hypothesis consistent with innocence: namely that he had had sex with Mr Flores at the Exchange Hotel but had not gone to Woolloomooloo with him.
Ms Webber's credibility
92When Ms Webber was contacted by police in 2009 she knew little about the investigation into Mr Flores' death. What she told police was not contaminated by what police had told her, since they told her very little. Importantly, she was not told how Mr Flores was killed. There was nothing in the press articles in evidence to the effect that Mr Flores was still alive for a time. The officer did not disclose this fact to Ms Webber. The only way she could have known that matter was if the offender had told her.
93The weight to be given to her evidence depends, in part, on its correspondence with the objective and known facts. The version Ms Webber gave of what the offender told her in September 1991 accords with the Agreed Facts: namely that he had hurt someone pretty badly in Woolloomooloo but that when he had left the man was still alive. Further when the offender threatened her, he told her that he had already killed a man, which was true since he knew that he had killed Mr Flores.

94It was, in substance, contended on behalf of the offender that Ms Webber's version accorded with her interest at the time, which was to minimise her potential exposure as an accessory after the fact. Accordingly, as I understood the argument, the offender submitted that the correspondence between her version and the actual facts was fortuitous, rather than an indication of her truthfulness. I do not accept this submission. Ms Webber's exposure to criminal prosecution was not obviously diminished by the circumstance that the victim was still alive when the offender left him.  As long as he died as a result of the wounds inflicted, the offender could be exposed to prosecution for murder and Ms Webber, if she assisted the offender in some way, had a potential exposure as an accessory after the fact for whatever crime he committed. Furthermore there was no evidence that Ms Webber was capable of drawing such distinctions, even if any were open to be drawn.
95I am not satisfied that Ms Webber had any other motive but to tell the truth when she deposed to the two conversations she had had with the offender. I accept that she was fearful of him and that it caused her substantial stress to speak to Detective Hungerford and to incriminate the offender. Had she harboured any desire for revenge against the offender, she would, in my view, have come forward in response to any one of the numerous requests from police for information that were published in the Sydney Star Observer and the mainstream press at the time and in the months following Mr Flores' death. The content of the two conversations she had with the offender about Mr Flores' death explained, in my view, the reason for the offender to lie to police about his personal life at the relevant time and to identify Mr Wallis as his then partner. He had a clear motive to prevent the police from interviewing Ms Webber, since she, of all people, had the capacity to implicate him in the murder. I am satisfied that he understood the significance of her evidence since he appreciated that the Crown case otherwise depended on DNA evidence, which could be explained by a casual sexual encounter with the deceased at the Exchange Hotel.
96I am satisfied that Ms Webber was mistaken about the chronology of the sexual assault of which she was a victim, the occasion when the offender came home with a torn shirt and blood on his body and the first and second conversations with the offender.
97The offender has established, from Ms Webber's Medicare records, that it is probable that the assault on Ms Webber took place on in May 1991 or in late October 1991. The absence of any medical record for September 1991 makes it unlikely that it occurred in that month. The offender has also established to the relevant standard that the only occasion on which he returned to the residence he shared with Ms Webber with a bloodied and torn shirt was in June 1991, since this was the occasion on which he had been assaulted after work. A contemporaneous description of the incident was recorded by one of the offender's treating medical practitioners on 2 June 1991. I am not satisfied that Mr Flores inflicted any material injury on the offender at all. Although the offender may have been cut, I am not satisfied that there were any cuts to his face or blood on his shirt. It follows that Ms Webber was also mistaken about the timing of that event relative to the publication of the article about Mr Flores in the Sydney Star Observer.
98Mr Nicholson also relied on there being no flood in Yamba in 2005 and the closest flood in time as having occurred in 2001, as indications of the unreliability of Ms Webber's evidence about time. I accept, as my findings above indicate, that Ms Webber's evidence about time is not necessarily reliable. I do not see the timing of the flood that she says destroyed her diary or indeed whether she recorded relevant conversations in her diary as adversely affecting her credibility in any material way. Mr Nicholson tendered contemporaneous advertisements of shirts to show the implausibility of Ms Webber having paid $120 for the shirt that she gave to the offender. Whether or not this was the truth or an exaggeration, I accept Ms Webber's evidence in the respects set out.  
99It does not follow from a witness' unreliability about dates or the relative timing of events that a witness is either untruthful or generally unreliable. It is common ground that the offender did suffer an assault at work which resulted in injury to him in June 1991 and in respect of which he sought medical attention. The series of consultations recorded in Ms Webber's Medicare records from late May to early June 1991 and also in late October 1991 are consistent with her having been the victim of a sexual assault for which she sought medical attention during either one of those periods. 
100Furthermore the Crown tendered four articles from the Sydney Star Observer. I am satisfied that the first of those articles was the one which Ms Webber raised with the offender since it concerned not only the killing of Mr Flores but it also listed several other so-called gay murders. The publication of this article and the fact of and timing of Mr Flores' death are the fixed points in time by reference to which the conversations of which Ms Webber gave evidence are to be measured, since they have been objectively established and have a connection with the conversations.
101It follows from my acceptance of Ms Webber's evidence about the two conversations that I am satisfied to the requisite standard that the offender told her that he had bashed a man at Woolloomooloo but that when he had left he was still alive and that he later, either in September 1991 or October 1991, appreciated that Mr Flores had died as a result of the attack and, accordingly, that he had killed him. However, irrespective of Ms.Webber's evidence, I am satisfied that the offender knew in September 1991 that he had killed Mr Flores by reason of his admission to Detective Hungerford in December 2008 that he had heard it on the news.
102I reject the offender's evidence that he did not know that Mr Flores had died until Detective Hungerford interviewed him in Tasmania. I am satisfied that the offender thought that he had got away with killing Mr Flores, whose brutal killing could readily be attributed to so-called gay bashings that were prevalent at the time. When Detective Hungerford confronted the offender with the existence of DNA evidence against him, he falsely denied his involvement, while at the same time, exploring the possibility of pleading to manslaughter, with a view to minimising his sentence. His desire to save his own skin at the expense of both truth and justice was further exemplified by his giving false evidence on oath at the trial and also before me in so far as he denied the conversations with Ms Webber.
103I am not satisfied that Mr Flores was capable of struggling with the offender or that he caused him any injury. The nature and extent of his injuries as well as the significant disparity between his size and that of the offender's makes it unlikely that Mr Flores inflicted harm on the offender. It was accepted by the Crown that the presence of the offender's DNA on Mr Flores' fingernails was consistent with a consensual sexual act. For the reasons given above, I consider that Ms Webber was mistaken in so far as she believed that the offender's bloodied and scratched appearance corresponded with his appearance when he returned to the unit in Strawberry Hills after killing Mr Flores. I do not accept that Mr Flores even managed to lacerate the offender's skin.
Sentencing - manslaughter
104I was taken to a number of cases involving the sentencing of offenders for manslaughter. It is well recognised that of all offences, manslaughter produces the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability and consequently there is a substantial range in the sentences imposed for this offence: R v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). For this reason, statistical analysis of sentences imposed for manslaughter is not helpful.
105The fundamental touchstone for sentencing such cases is that there has been an unlawful taking of human life for which the offender is criminally liable and for which he must be sentenced to imprisonment. 
Maximum penalty
106The maximum penalty is an indication of the relative seriousness of the offence (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [31], per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) and is therefore to be taken into account. The maximum term of imprisonment for manslaughter is 25 years: s 24 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). There is no standard non-parole period.
The objective seriousness of the offence
107The offender has pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis that when he assaulted Mr Flores he intended to cause him grievous bodily harm and that at that time of the assault he had lost his self control as a result of Mr Flores telling him that he was HIV positive and that Mr Flores' conduct could have induced an ordinary person in the offender's position to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him.
108The offender admitted in his evidence at the sentence hearing that the first time the topic of HIV was raised between Mr Flores and the offender was after they had had oral sex and Mr Flores volunteered that he was HIV positive. It follows from this admission that the offender made no enquiry as to whether Mr Flores was HIV positive before engaging in oral sex with him and, accordingly, Mr Flores did not mislead him about this HIV status. The fact contained in the Agreed Facts about the advice Mr Goosen had given Mr Flores about disclosing his HIV status to any sexual partners, together with the circumstance that it was Mr Flores who initiated the disclosure, indicates that Mr Flores did not hide his HIV status from the offender. The offender simply did not make any inquiry before engaging in oral sex with Mr Flores. The offender admitted in the sentence hearing that he was prepared to engage in acts of a sexual nature not knowing whether that person may or may not have HIV.
109In re-examination in his evidence at the sentence hearing the offender said that he lost his temper and therefore his capacity to control himself for no more than four or five minutes and that by the time he had finished assaulting Mr Flores he had started to calm down. It follows that the offender was no longer out of control when he dragged Mr Flores to a darker place.  I am satisfied that he did so in order to reduce the prospects of his involvement being revealed by his proximity to the scene, delay the discovery of Mr Flores and to remove any chance that his life could be saved. 
110I do not accept Mr Armstrong's evidence, which was given in the form of an affidavit adopting what he had told Ms Duffy whom he saw on 13 May 2014, some four weeks after he had given evidence in the sentence hearing before me that he made the assumption that if a partner was aware that he had the HIV virus he would disclose it as a matter of courtesy. I do not accept that he made any such assumption. I consider that evidence to be a recent invention. I do not accept Mr Nicholson's submission, which was not established by the evidence, that there was a convention in the gay community at the relevant time that if neither enquiry nor disclosure was made, the participants could assume that neither was HIV positive.  The proposition advanced by Mr Nicholson that ""the engagement is undertaken on the basis of what I might call a presumption of innocence that everything is okay"" has not been made out. 
111I regard this manslaughter as objectively very serious. It was a brutal and savage attack by a large, strong man against a relatively diminutive weaker man. I am not satisfied that Mr Flores was even able to inflict a laceration on the offender. At the time of the attack he was prone and his pants were down. The coroner did not observe any sign of injuries to Mr Flores that were of the nature of defence injuries. He was entirely at the offender's mercy. The degree of violence was very substantial. The coroner described the degree of force as ""severe"", such as might be applied in a motor vehicle accident. I do not accept the relatively benign description put forward by Mr Armstrong and his counsel that he only intended to injure his face and wind him.
112The only threat Mr Flores posed to Mr Armstrong was that he was HIV positive. Although infection by the virus could be fatal, it was a risk that Mr Armstrong was sufficiently cavalier to take, since he made no enquiry as to that matter before engaging in sex with Mr Flores. I do not regard the provocation as being particularly great in these circumstances. Mr Armstrong lost control immediately after Mr Flores' disclosure, a factor which might in other cases diminish the objective seriousness of the offence. However, he admitted to Ms Duffy that his ""quick temper and 'anger issues'"" were to blame for his assault on Mr Flores. The offender was also, at the time of the attack, disinhibited by both alcohol and amphetamines (speed).
113Mr Armstrong's conduct immediately after the assault was clear-headed, callous and selfish. But for his slip in confessing his crime to Ms Webber and the persistent investigation of Detective Hungerford he would have, quite literally, got away with what would have been murder but for the provocation on the basis of which his lesser plea to manslaughter was accepted.
Historic crime
114I am obliged to take into account sentencing practice at the date of the commission of the offence if sentencing practice has moved adversely to Mr Armstrong in the interim: R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368. The Crown submitted that there was no discernible change. It was contended on behalf of the offender that sentences for manslaughter are presently longer than they were in 1991 when Mr Flores was killed. The onus of establishing such an adverse movement rests on the offender. I have considered the document entitled ""Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales: 1990-1993"", which is published by the Judicial Commission, as well as the numerous cases to which Mr Nicholson referred me by handing up tables of such sentences and the circumstances in which they were imposed. 
115There is a substantial difficulty in identifying any trend in circumstances where the offence of manslaughter covers such disparate conduct. In some cases it might be regarded as almost as serious as murder, whereas in others, it might be regarded as an unfortunate consequence of an ill-considered act. There is little utility in comparisons where one is not comparing like conduct. 
116The Court of Criminal Appeal in Scott v R [2011] NSWCCA 221 considered whether there had been an adverse movement in sentencing practices with respect to manslaughter between May 2000, when the crime was committed and 2010 when Mr Scott was sentenced. I am indebted to James J's helpful analysis of the authorities and the statistics and respectfully adopt his Honour's conclusion (with which Bathurst CJ and Johnson J agreed) that comparative statistics do not establish that sentencing practices have moved adversely to offenders for more serious offences of manslaughter during that period. 
117The period under consideration in the present case is longer, since the crime was committed in 1991 and it is now almost 23 years later. Nonetheless the maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment has remained the same throughout the period. It would be reasonable to assume that legislative provisions regarding murder would have some impact on manslaughter sentences because of the relationship between the offences and the common element in voluntary manslaughter of an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm (see the discussion in R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184 at [25]-[44] per Spigelman CJ, RS Hulme and Adams J generally agreeing). The significant legislative change in this area occurred in 1989. While the introduction of a standard non-parole period for murders committed after 1 February 2003 may have affected the length of murder sentences, I do not discern any consequential effect on the length of sentences for manslaughter.
118I am not persuaded that there has been any such adverse movement. 
Pre-sentence custody
119It is agreed that the offender's sentence should be backdated in order to take into account the period which he has already spent in custody. Since his arrest in December 2008 he has been convicted of two unrelated offences of sexual intercourse without consent. At the time Murrell DCJ sentenced him for those offences, Buddin J had already imposed a sentence for murder of 17 years commencing on 4 December 2008 and expiring on 3 December 2025 with a non-parole period of 11 years and 6 months expiring on 3 June 2020. When the offender's conviction for murder was quashed, his sentence for the sexual assault offences was varied by the Court of Criminal Appeal to commence on 4 December 2008: Armstrong v R [2013] NSWCCA 137. The varied non-parole period for the second offence expired on 20 October 2012 and the total sentence is due to expire on 20 October 2014.
120Mr Nicholson submitted that I should allow a degree of concurrence between that sentence and the sentence to be imposed, in part because the sentence imposed by Murrell DCJ commenced two years before the non-parole period of the sentence imposed by Buddin J for murder expired. The Crown contended that the sentence I impose on Mr Armstrong for manslaughter ought commence on 21 October 2012, immediately after the expiry of the non-parole period for the sexual offences and that the factors that influenced her Honour were no longer applicable.
121In all the circumstances I do not consider it to be appropriate to backdate the sentence for manslaughter to a date earlier than the expiry of the non-parole period for the sentence imposed for the sex offences. There is entirely separate criminality between the manslaughter and the sexual offences. Although the principle of totality sometimes makes it appropriate for there be some concurrence between sentences I do not consider the present to be such a case. I propose to commence the sentence for manslaughter on 21 October 2012, immediately following the expiry of the non-parole period for the sexual offences.
Lack of remorse
122The offender has demonstrated a striking lack of remorse. The threat made to Ms Webber that he had already killed one man and could kill another demonstrates his lack of remorse. The timing of his plea, which will be addressed below in the context of its utilitarian value, is also evidence of this. He was charged with murder on 4 December 2008. On 24 December 2008 he had the conversation referred to above with Detective Hungerford. On 20 January 2009 Detective Hungerford had a telephone conversation with Ms Clark, the offender's Legal Aid solicitor, in which Detective Hungerford mentioned the admission the offender had made to him on 24 December 2008 and that Mr Flores was indeed HIV positive. He suggested to her that it may be that the crime was manslaughter, although that was a matter for the DPP.
123The conversation Mr Armstrong had with his father on 6 April 2009 provides a further indication that he well knew the effect of his denial of any involvement in the assault that led to Mr Flores' death and that a plea to manslaughter would be inconsistent with such denial, but if accepted would lead to a lower sentence.
124In submissions at the paper committal hearing Mr Armstrong's then counsel, Mr Haesler SC, contended that there was a ""plausible alternative scenario"", namely that Mr Lee had killed Mr Flores, and argued that the conversation on 24 December 2008 was inadmissible.  
125Mr Armstrong was arraigned in this Court on 4 December 2009. When the Crown sought to tender the admission made to Detective Hungerford on 24 December 2008, Mr Armstrong's counsel objected and the admission was rejected. Justice Buddin, the trial judge, rejected the tender of the evidence.  His Honour adverted in the voir dire to the forensic consequences of Mr Armstrong's instructions to object to that evidence and conduct the case on the basis that he had no involvement in Mr Flores' death.
126The way in which the trial was conducted showed, in my view, that far from being remorseful, the offender was prepared to blame others, including a named person, for acts for which he knew he was responsible. His counsel at trial said to the jury in his closing address, presumably on instructions:""I can't prove Mr Lee is the killer.  As I said, there is evidence which doesn't fit, there is also evidence which does.  So what we say is the testimony of Mr Lee raises for you the fact that there were people at the time prepared to prey on homosexual men, to carry out the sort of attacks we say were carried out on Mr Flores.""  
127In re-examination Mr Nicholson asked the offender how he felt about having conducted his case at trial on that basis. His answer was, in my view, self-centred and, in so far as it purported to express concern for Mr Flores' family, disingenuous:""Now, thinking back, it was the most stupidest thing I could have done.  I should have just owned up from the bat and had all this closure, not only for myself, but for the Flores family and friends, which is why I have turned around and changed my plea to guilty on the manslaughter, to give them closure.  Because if we just went the other way it just drags on for them as well which is putting them through something they don't need to be.""
128On 20 May 2013 the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed Mr Armstrong's conviction for murder and ordered a retrial which was listed to commence on Monday 7 April 2014. On Friday 4 April 2014 a letter was received by the DPP from Legal Aid advising that Mr Armstrong would plead guilty to manslaughter on the basis of provocation.
129I am not satisfied that the offender feels any remorse for his crime.
Subjective matters
130The offender was born in Tasmania in 1963. He was 28 when he killed Mr Flores. He has five siblings. He described his father as being relatively passive and his mother as being aggressive and dominant. 
131When the offender was a child, he went to many different schools in Tasmania because of his parents' frequent moves. His parents separated and reconciled during this period. He was disruptive in class and subjected to corporal punishment, both at home and at school.
132His younger brother, Jamie, came out as homosexual in his teens. Jamie, who lives in Melbourne with his partner, was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1988. The offender married in 1983 shortly prior to the birth of his daughter Suzanne. He and his wife separated and reconciled as a result of which a son was born in 1985. His wife, from whom he is now divorced, has bi-polar disorder. The offender's daughter is in gaol and has experienced problems with drugs and alcohol. She has five children of her own, two of whom are being looked after by a former partner and the remaining three are in foster care with their aunt, the offender's sister.
133The offender was in custody between 2002 and 2004. During this period his mother died.
134Throughout his adult life, he has been in relatively constant employment, most frequently in the hospitality industry. He drank alcohol and took amphetamines. Prior to his arrest and extradition in December 2008 he managed several Domino pizza outlets in Tasmania.
135In 1995 he was diagnosed as HIV positive. He is on anti-retroviral medication. He has been assaulted in gaol as a result of which he has reduced vision in his left eye. He has lost contact with his family since being in gaol.
136In an assessment of his personality conducted by Ms Duffy, he was found to have avoidant, schizoid, masochistic (self-defeating), dependent and anti-social traits. He suffers substantial anxiety. He has to date been reluctant to seek counselling while in custody. 
Criminal history
137The offender's criminal history contains some convictions for offences of violence, both before and after his killing of Mr Flores. He is not entitled to leniency. 
Rehabilitation prospects and likelihood of re-offending
138The offender submitted that I should take into account as a mitigating factor that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. I am not satisfied of this matter. His preparedness to resort to violence stems, as Ms Duffy said, from the violence to which he was subjected as a child. Justice demands that some allowance be made for the circumstance that the offender did not have any choice as to the environment in which he was raised. Although he will be older when he is eventually released from custody, I am not satisfied that he will either be wiser or more able to control his impulses or more able to express them in a non-violent way. 
Plea of guilty
139I am required to take into account Mr Armstrong's plea of guilty. The utilitarian value of the plea is low because of its timing. Although a four week trial has been avoided, the sequence of events set out above shows what has preceded it. Mr Armstrong has been aware since at least 24 December 2008 of the advantages of a plea to manslaughter when charged with murder. He has pleaded at what was, effectively, the last possible opportunity. Accordingly, in these circumstances, I consider that it is appropriate to allow a discount somewhat less than the guideline range. Although some discount should be allowed, I am not persuaded that it ought be more than 5%. Accordingly, there will be a discount of 5%.
Special circumstances
140The requirement to set a non-parole period and to find special circumstances before departing from the statutory ratio are relevantly the same for offences committed in 1991 as they were following the enactment of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW): see s 5 of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW), although the expressions ""minimum term"" and ""additional term"" have been replaced in the later Act 
141It was submitted on behalf of Mr Armstrong that I ought find special circumstances on the basis of Ms Duffy's opinion that the offender has become institutionalised by reason of his lengthy incarceration.  It was also submitted that the question whether and when he ought be released was one more appropriately made by the Serious Offenders Review Council. I am not persuaded that the offender's institutionalisation constitutes special circumstances in the present case. Indeed one might consider that anyone who spends a lengthy time in custody would be likely to become institutionalised.
142Secondly, Mr Nicholson submitted that I ought take into account the whole of the time the offender has spent in custody since 4 December 2008 and adjust the statutory ratio for the total term and the non-parole period for manslaughter accordingly. The reasons for not backdating the commencement of the present sentence are also applicable here. In my view the sentence for manslaughter ought stand apart from, and not be affected by, the sentence imposed for the sex offences.
143I note that it is implicit in the variation by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the sentence for the sex offences that Buddin J was satisfied that there were special circumstances.  It was not submitted that I was bound by that finding.  Indeed, as I indicated to the parties, I have not considered Buddin J's remarks on sentence lest I be influenced by the factual substratum of the trial which was necessarily different from the Agreed Facts and evidence before me. I do not regard the sentence imposed by Buddin J, which was set aside when the conviction was quashed, as having any bearing on the exercise of my sentencing discretion.
Loss of the deceased
144The deceased's sister, Ines Flores, described the effect on her of the deceased's death in a statement that was read out in Court, a copy of which was handed up. Her statements bears witness to the grief, pain and loss suffered by those who survive the deceased.
145Under the law, the loss suffered by the deceased and his loved ones cannot be reflected by any sentence I impose. However, before I impose a sentence, I wish to pause to acknowledge the loss of Felipe Flores to his family and to his friends and in particular to Ines. I take this opportunity to extend my personal sympathies to all those who loved him.
146Retribution is one of the many aspects of punishment and is particularly significant when a life has been taken. However, under laws that have been in existence for a long time now, the loss suffered by the deceased and his family cannot be replicated by any sentence I impose. I am conscious of the observations of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 87-88. It is the approach that I adopt.
Sentence
147Paul Armstrong:
(1)For the manslaughter of Felipe Flores , I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 13 years and 3 months, commencing 21 October 2012, with a non-parole period of 9 years and 11 months.
(2)The earliest date upon which you are eligible for release on parole is 20 September 2022.

2764038,R v Stables [2014] NSWSC 697,"reasons for verdict

1The accused, Luke Paul Stables, has been tried before me, sitting without a jury, for the murder of his mother, Enriquita Stables, and the wounding of his brother, Mark Stables. In respect of his brother, he was indicted for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, but in the course of the trial that charge was amended to one of reckless wounding. The charges arise from a tragic incident at the family home at Dean Park in the evening of 6 September 2012. The only issue in relation to both charges is whether he has made out the defence of mental illness.

2The accused was 28 years old at the time of the incident. He was living at the family home with his mother, his father, John Stables, and his older brother, Mark. He also has a younger brother, Steven, who is married and who was living at another address in Dean Park.

Background

3Enriquita Stables was of Filipino origin. At the time of her death she and John Stables had been married for almost 30 years. It seems that they had been a devoted couple. When he was interviewed by police on the night of the incident, John Stables said that the accused had ""virtually killed"" him, as Enriquita had been his ""whole life.""

4There is in evidence a volume of material about the accused's medical history. Although it is important, a brief summary of it is sufficient for present purposes. He suffers from neurofibromatosis, a condition which manifests itself as lumps on his body and also in his brain. This was apparent from the age of about 13, and it may have been congenital. As a result he has temporal lobe epilepsy, and has suffered seizures from the age of 19. Neurological testing revealed cognitive impairment, consistent with mild mental retardation. 

5In interviews with the police the accused's father and brothers described a longstanding pattern of irrational, aggressive and violent behaviour on his part, directed at them. John Stables referred to an incident a couple of years previously when the accused had picked him up and thrown him against a wall, breaking his hip. Generally, he said that the accused ""used to go crazy quite often."" He said that ""when he was placid he was quite O.K. but occasionally he'd go absolutely ballistic, uncontrollable ... ."" Both Mark and Steven said that there were many incidents when he was violent towards them. Mark described him as ""a nutter"" and ""just crazy."" Asked what he meant by that, he replied, ""Just you know, fighting for nothing, stabbing, stab with a screwdriver, you know, doesn't matter what it is ... you know like, metal pole, ... hit with a baseball bat, just everything.""

6Steven, when asked to describe the accused's behaviour said, ""Just unpredictable ... he could do anything. He'd be happy one minute and then psycho the next."" Steven came to the family home on the night of the killing, following a telephone call from his father. When he saw the accused he noticed that he had a ""blank stare."" He told police that the accused used to stare like that all the time when he was ""spaced out"" or ""angry."" 

7On occasions when he became aggressive police were called. It seems that the only person who could control him, at least at times, was his mother. John Stables told police that, on occasions when he went ""crazy"", she would try to calm him down and get him to take his medication. That would calm him down ""pretty quickly"" but, as John Stables put it, ""he won't even realise what he's done."" 

8Over the years he had been admitted to hospital on a number of occasions following an outburst. Medical records noted post-ictal confusion or aggression. He was sometimes observed to be delusional, speaking of hearing voices or of spirits entering his body, and post-ictal psychosis was diagnosed. He continued to have seizures despite a course of medication, and a neurological assessment in August 2011 diagnosed ""intractable epilepsy not controlled with medication.""

9In June 2012, three months before the incident, he saw Dr Rhonda Buskell, psychiatrist, with his parents. She noted the parents' concern about his longstanding tendency to be aggressive, which they did not attribute to his seizures. While she did not elicit symptoms of post-ictal psychosis, she was of the opinion that he manifested features of post-ictal confusion, associated with agitation and aggression. In August 2012, Dr Chong Wong, neurologist, noted that he was having one to two complex partial seizures per month, and changed his medication.

The incident

10On the evening in question the accused, his parents and his brother, Mark were at home. His parents were in the lounge room, watching television. Mark was asleep, as he had to start work early the next day. The accused started screaming and shouting. His mother tried to calm him down, as did Mark, who had been woken by the commotion. The accused grabbed his father by the throat and was screaming, ""Nanna's telling me, Nanna's talking to me."" ""Nanna"" was his paternal grandmother, who was deceased but to whom he had been close. He kissed his father, which he had not done for many years. He also grabbed Mark by the neck and said, ""They're all tryin' to kill me, they're all trying to kill me."" Mark had no idea to whom he was referring.

11He ran into his bedroom, where he had a collection of what might be described as ornamental swords. He came out with one of them, a Samurai style sword. His mother told Mark to run and pushed him into the laundry. Mark tried to close the door to prevent the accused following them, but he lunged through the laundry door and stabbed his mother in the back. She fell down and he stabbed her several more times.

12Mark attempted to intervene but the accused lunged at him with the sword. Mark grabbed the sword and struggled with him, eventually disarming him and restraining him until the police arrived. In the process Mark sustained a number of injuries, giving rise to the charge of reckless wounding. In the meantime his father, John Stables had dialled 000 to have the police come to the house, saying that the accused had an ornamental sword and that he was going ""berserk."" He did not see the accused stab his wife, but it was while he was speaking to the 000 operator that Mark called out to him that she was dead. A recording of the 000 call is in evidence. One can clearly hear John Stables' outrage and anguish at what had occurred, and to listen to the recording can only be described as heartbreaking.

13When police and ambulance officers arrived Mrs Stables was pronounced dead. On post-mortem examination a number of stab wounds were identified, some more serious than others. The lethal wound had penetrated the right side of the chest, passing through the right lung, the diaphragm and the liver, and causing significant internal bleeding. 

14The accused was arrested at the scene and spoke to police briefly. He said that he did not know what had happened but he knew that he had stabbed his ""mum."" Asked if something had happened before he stabbed her, he said that he ""went crazy."" He said that he was eating sausages and he started crying. Asked what he was crying about, he said that he did not know but added an inexplicable reference to ""barbeque sauce."" He said more than once that he did not know why he had stabbed his mother.

15 He was taken to Blacktown Hospital, where his behaviour was observed to be bizarre. Police noticed him to be breathing fast and heavily, that his eyes were open wide and appeared glazed, and he was staring at the ceiling. He spoke of spirits and a ouija board. At one stage he asked to be put in a mental hospital and then said ""fuckin' sausages"", and was observed to be shaking his head from side to side. While being examined by doctors, he said that he heard an old female voice in his head telling him not to go crazy. He also said that voices told him to take his medication and that he shouldn't do ""stupid shit."" On another occasion he was seen to be crying loudly and he said ""Sorry, mum."" 

16On 7 September he was refused bail at Blacktown Local Court and he has remained in custody since. He suffered seizures on 8 and 9 September, and was admitted to Westmead Hospital for several days thereafter. A psychiatrist at the hospital, Dr Manish Anand, noted that he appeared perplexed and expressed delusional thoughts. He diagnosed him to be suffering from post-ictal delirium, with or without post-ictal psychosis, and recommended ongoing treatment with anticonvulsant medication. Two days later, similar observations were made by Dr Sara Ghaly, psychiatrist, who described ongoing signs of cognitive impairment, perplexed affect, and slowing of thought processes. She thought that he was suffering from a delirium secondary to his post-ictal state with psychotic features. 

17On 7 December 2012, he took part in an electronically recorded interview with police. It was a lengthy interview but it is not necessary to recite it in any detail. He described his epileptic condition, saying that if he had a seizure he could not really remember what he'd done. He said that he had had a good relationship with his mother. Asked if he had ever had any fights or problems with her, he said, ""No, I done everything for my mum, I just can't work out why ... ."" He went on to say that on the evening in question he had had an altercation with his brother, Mark in his bedroom relating to the family pets, a cat and a dog. His mother came into the room, and he could remember that he had the sword and that Mark and his mother were screaming. He said that he was thinking to himself, ""Did Mark do it or did I do it?"" He thought that Mark must have pushed his mother onto the sword.

18He said that he had taken his medication that morning but not that night. The accounts given to police by his father and by Mark were put to him briefly, but he said that he remembered none of that. His only recollection was being in his room the whole time.

19Later in the interview he again expressed his uncertainty about who was responsible for the stabbing of his mother. He said: 

""Did I stab her or did I not stab her? ... I am always thinking to myself did I do it or didn't I do it? Because I'm here, like I'm always thinking to myself am I hearing these voices and everything, did you do it or didn't I do it? ... I'm thinking to myself I didn't do it.


...

I did have the sword in my hand and then I'm just thinking to myself, what the fuck just happened? And then I'm just thinking the whole time I was in gaol I'm just thinking did I fucking do it or didn't I do it? Because I did hear, I have, I've been hearing all these voices the whole time.""

20Asked what the voices were saying, he said, ""Don't take the fucking blame, Luke, like and I don't know who it is, like it's, it is some scary shit like ... ."" Asked whether he was coming out of a seizure at the time he found he had a sword in his hand, he said, ""Yeah, I was having a seizure like, 'cause that's what I don't like the stuff in my brain and everything like.""

21Three other matters should be noted. In evidence is an exercise book which the accused seems to have used as a diary. On one page there is an entry, apparently made some time in April 2012, which reads, ""let kill a family member ... old lumy."" There is nothing in the evidence to explain this entry. In a later entry, dated 31 April, he wrote, ""I don't not (know?) when it started but I think some spirit is with me and it's a bit scary ... ."" At about 7.30am on 6 September, the day of the incident, he told a neighbour, Ms Rose Kinder, that he was ""having a bad day.""

Forensic psychiatric evidence

22For the purpose of these proceedings, the accused was examined by two well known and respected forensic psychiatrists, Dr Bruce Westmore and Dr Richard Furst. They provided reports and Dr Westmore gave oral evidence. 

23To both psychiatrists the accused gave an account of the fatal incident more or less to the same effect as that which he had given to the police in the December interview. Neither psychiatrist considered that account reliable. Dr Furst in his report said that he would ""place little weight"" on that version of events, given the passage of time between the incident and the interview and the likelihood that his memory of his mental state at the time was ""impaired by his epilepsy, confusional state, and persistent signs of psychosis."" In oral evidence, Dr Westmore acknowledged the possibility that his suggestion that Mark might in some way have been responsible for the stabbing was an attempt at self-justification, but referred to evidence that he was ""quite confused and disorganised"" on the night in question. On balance, he considered that his recollection of the incident was ""probably disturbed.""

24I should say that, for my part, I am satisfied that Mark Stables played no part, even indirectly, in the death of his mother. Rather, he disarmed the accused, suffering injuries in the process. I have no doubt that the events unfolded in the way in which I have earlier described them.

25Dr Furst's report was the earlier of the two. He explained epilepsy as a chronic brain disorder, characterised by recurrent unprovoked seizures. A seizure typically causes ""altered awareness, abnormal sensations, focal involuntary movements or convulsions."" He continued:

""Although seizures usually only last for about 1-2 minutes, there are well described post-ictal (after-seizure) phenomena that have psychiatric relevance, including ongoing altered states of consciousness and awareness, headache, and post-ictal psychosis. About 30-50% of all people with epilepsy have psychiatric difficulties, the most common of which are changes in personality, psychosis, violence, and depression.""

26Dr Furst noted that the accused's anticonvulsant medication had changed only two weeks before the incident because his epilepsy was persisting, and that he had seizures after the event. He considered it likely that he was having a seizure either at the time of the incident or shortly before it. He referred to the observations of Dr Anand and Dr Ghaly at Westmead Hospital, describing their findings of post-ictal confusion or delirium with psychotic features as ""a form of organic psychosis, which is often associated with cognitive impairment, mood instability and aggression."" Referring to the records of previous treatment with which he had been supplied, he said:

""The medical files were consistent with Mr Stables suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy, complicated by post-ictal aggression, which is a neurological disorder often associated with mood disturbance, cognitive impairment, and psychotic symptoms. This is the most likely explanation for his apparent paranoid thoughts and hallucinations at the time of the offence in question before the Court.""

27Dr Westmore had the report of Dr Furst when he prepared his own report, and his conclusions are to the same effect. In the light of the accused's background and his behaviour on the night in question as described by his father and his brother, the fact that he had not taken his medication that night, the fact that he had poorly controlled epilepsy and that he suffered subsequent seizures, Dr Westmore concluded that he was ""at the time he stabbed his mother, on the balance of probability, suffering from a psychotic episode due to a general medical condition (neurofibromatosis and related epilepsy).""

The law

28Of course, in most cases murder is a crime of specific intent, that is, an intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. In helpful written submissions Ms Loukas SC, for the accused, drew my attention to R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226, 63 NSWLR 490, 154 A Crim R 349. In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal had occasion to consider the approach to the defence of mental illness in the trial of an offence of specific intent, in the light of the decision of the High Court in Hawkins v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 500. The offence in question in Minani was malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. Relevantly for present purposes, Hunt AJA, with whom Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreed, said at [32]:

""Proof of the specific intention which the Crown must prove in such a case is not always an easy one where there is an element of mental illness involved. In Hawkins v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 500 (at 510, 512-514, 517), the High Court held that, contrary to what had previously been thought to be the law in this State, evidence of mental illness is relevant to the question as to whether the accused's act was done with the specific intent charged. The High Court held that the order in which the issues should be determined in a case where there is evidence of mental illness is: (1) Was it the act of the accused which, in this case, caused the malicious wounding? (2) Was he criminally responsible for doing that act? (3) Was that act done with the specific intention required? The second question is resolved by a finding that mental illness had been established. The third question arises only if the second question is answered adversely to the accused and, in those circumstances, the evidence of mental illness (even though insufficient to make out the defence) is relevant to the issue of specific intent. That evidence is not, however, relevant to the issue as to whether the act of the accused was a deliberate one. The High Court said (at 515) that there was no necessary inconsistency between mental abnormality and the existence of a specific intent, but nevertheless the evidence of mental illness must be taken into account in determining whether there was that specific intent. As the judge found in the present case that the defence of mental illness had been established, it was unnecessary for him to make any finding of specific intent."" 

29Applying that analysis to the present case, I must determine firstly whether it was a deliberate or willed act of the accused which caused the death of his mother. On the evidence, clearly it was, and Ms Loukas made no submission to the contrary. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that element is made out. However, in the context of the present case I must determine whether he was criminally responsible for doing that act. It is that question which raises the defence of mental illness, to which I shall turn shortly. It is only if I were to reject that defence that I would have to consider the requisite intent. 

30Whether the reasoning based on Hawkins v The Queen is applicable to the offence of reckless wounding is not so clear. Neither the Crown prosecutor nor Ms Loukas addressed this question. While reckless wounding is not an offence of specific intent, it has a mental element. It must be established that the accused realised that by his actions he might possibly cause actual bodily harm to his brother: s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900. In the light of medical evidence from Blacktown Hospital about Mark's condition after the incident, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a wounding. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was caused by a deliberate, willed act of the accused. Again, Ms Loukas did not suggest otherwise. 

31It may be that it is at that point, before considering the requisite state of mind, that I should determine the accused's criminal responsibility for his act by considering the defence of mental illness. However, if that is not the correct approach, I should record that I am in any event satisfied that the element of recklessness is established. Yet again, Ms Loukas put no argument to the contrary. In that event, the defence of mental illness remains to be considered. 

32Ms Loukas' submissions reveal that in murder cases where the defence of mental illness arose a number of judges of this court, perhaps in ignorance of Minani, have continued to approach the issue in accordance with the law as it stood before the High Court's decision in Hawkins. I must confess to having been one of them. That approach, enshrined in R v S [1979] 2 NSWLR 1, was to determine whether, absent the mental illness, all the elements of the offence had been proved before considering the defence. If I were to adopt that approach, I would find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the intention to kill his mother or, at least, to cause her grievous bodily harm. Again, the defence of mental illness would remain to be considered. In this case either approach would lead to the same result because, as I said at the outset, the real issue is whether the defence has been made out.

33The accused bears the burden of establishing that defence on the balance of probabilities. The defence is made out if I am satisfied that, more likely than not, at the time of the offences he was suffering from a mental illness such that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. 

34The test was explained by Sir Owen Dixon in his summing-up to the jury in a murder trial in Canberra in 1933, in which the issue was mental illness: The King v Porter (1936) 55 CLR 182. Although couched in the language of a past generation, it would be difficult to find a more lucid explanation of it. Speaking of the accused in that trial, His Honour said (at 189-90): 

""... The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people."" 

Verdict

35From their forensic experience, both Dr Westmore and Dr Furst are familiar with the legal test for the defence. Both were of the opinion that it had been met. Dr Westmore, after the passage from his report which I have quoted above, continued:

""The epilepsy and the associated psychosis are diseases of the mind and Mr Stables would, in my opinion, have available to him the defence of mental illness in relation to the death of his mother. These conditions would have totally deprived him of the capacity to understand that what he was doing was wrong.""

Dr Furst concluded:

""In my opinion, his acute confusional state and psychosis may well have prevented him from awareness of his actions at the time of the offence. He was probably also unaware of the wrongfulness of what he was doing, as his psychosis prevented him from reasoning about his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure. He has the mental illness defence available to him.""

36I am not persuaded that the accused was unaware of his actions at the relevant time, but I am satisfied that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. I am satisfied that the defence has been established in respect of both charges. The psychiatrists did not address in terms the wounding of Mark Stables but, clearly, that was an inextricable part of the incident, affected by the state of mind in which the accused had killed his mother. The Crown prosecutor responsibly accepted that the defence was made out, agreeing with the submissions of Ms Loukas on this issue. As to the killing of his mother, I am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that there appears to have been no rational motive for the accused to do so. His relationship with his father and his brothers had been characterised by conflict, but that was not the case with his mother. He told Dr Westmore that he thought of her ""all the time"", adding that she ""used to do everything for us, everything for me."" It is particularly distressing that, because of his mental condition, he killed the woman who was dear to him and who had always supported and cared for him.

37Accordingly, in respect of both counts in the indictment I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness. I shall consult the parties about the form of the consequential order which I must make.

38The verdicts are, of course, inevitable. The accused's management and future are now in the hands of the appropriate authorities. It is, however, appropriate that I should recognise the harrowing experience of Mr John Stables and his son, Mark. No doubt, the injuries which Mark suffered are overshadowed by the emotional scars which both of those men must continue to wear. I express my deepest sympathy to them, as I do to Steven Stables, his wife and their son, and to all those affected by this tragic death.

Order

39I direct that the accused, Mr Luke Stables, be detained at the Parklea Correctional Centre or such other place as may be directed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

2764042,R v JP [2014] NSWSC 698,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1The offender, referred to in the proceedings as JP, was arraigned on a charge of the murder of Eden Delir arising in respect of events that occurred on the evening of Saturday, 30 October 2010.

2The offender pleaded not guilty to murder.

3The trial before a jury of twelve and myself commenced on 30 September 2013 and on 4 November 2013 the jury returned a verdict of ""not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter"".

4The offender accordingly now stands for sentence on the jury's verdict for the offence of manslaughter.

5The offender was born in 1995. He was accordingly aged 15 years as at the date of the offence and he is presently 18 years of age.

6Following the return of the guilty verdict bail was refused.

7The sentence hearing took place on 4 and 24 April 2014.

The Events of 30 October 2010

8On the evening of 30 October 2010 Eden Delir attended a teenage Halloween party at premises in Restwell Road, Bossley Park. A number of young people were invited largely through the internet website ""Facebook"". The evidence was that there were some messages posted on Facebook regarding some people from the Campbelltown area indicating that they were going to attend and bring drugs and alcohol to the party.

9In due course, a group of young males referred to as ""the Wakeley boys"" attended the party, uninvited, supposedly on the basis that males from Campbelltown referred to in evidence as ""the Campbelltown boys"" might attend and cause trouble. The offender was one of the former group to which I have referred. The members of it were described in evidence as of Middle Eastern appearance.

10The evidence indicated that Eden Delir arrived at the party at about 7:00pm with his friend JE and another female where they then commenced socialising with others. The evidence indicates that he appeared to be in good spirits whilst at the party. Prior to the attack upon him he had not been involved on the night in any form of dispute with the offender or any of his group.

Events

11On the evening of Saturday, 30 October 2010 at approximately 8:00pm or a little later, the group of males, ""the Wakeley boys"" including the offender arrived at the party in Bossley Park.

12There was evidence that they were told that the Campbelltown boys were not attending the party. Nonetheless they stayed and entered the house. One of them was said to be holding a tubular metal pole. 

13There was evidence that members of this uninvited group commenced asking individuals whether they were from Campbelltown, and one or more of their members in boisterous fashion were calling out at times asking ""whose the Campbelltown boys"". The evidence indicated that the attitude and tone of at least some of the members of this group appeared to be aggressive and confrontational and one or more of them were calling out from time to time in a loud voice thereby causing some disturbance to the party environment.

14At approximately 8:40pm a number of the partygoers, including Eden Delir, were out at the front of the house where the party was being held.

15Evidence was given by a number of witnesses. Some of that evidence went to the issue of the identity of the attacker who struck Eden Delir with a bottle and whether that person was the offender. I will deal with some of the evidence relevant to the question of the basis of the jury's verdict and to the findings that I am required to make for the purposes of sentencing. 

16Before the attack upon the deceased, there was some evidence that at least one of the Wakeley boys group, not being the offender, saw Eden Delir at the party and said something to the effect that Eden had ""snitched"" on him, an apparent reference to Eden having made a report to police about a stolen mobile phone.

(1) KC

17KC, a friend of Eden Delir's, attended the party and he saw a good deal of the events as they unfolded. He said he went out the front of the house and joined two friends. Shortly afterwards he said he saw the group of young males of Middle Eastern appearance also come out to the front of the house. He said he had earlier seen them acting in an aggressive manner inside the house.

18At the time they came out to the front of the house one of the males in the group was carrying what he described as a round tubular pole. KC said that he heard one of their number call out to Eden to come over to them. He said that Eden followed their request and went over towards them. He said that they then commenced to walk towards him.

19KC said that then a commotion broke out. He considered that there were about six young males of Middle Eastern appearance in the group. He said they surrounded Eden and then commenced to kick and hit him. He said he then heard glass break. He did not see a bottle make contact with the deceased as there was a tree or bush in his line of vision. He said, however, that he saw a pole being raised and also a bottle being raised and he saw a lot of kicking and hitting. He said that the young males in the group were then surrounding Eden.

20He said that he saw the deceased struck to the ground. This he said was shortly after he heard the glass shattering.

21He said that he was about 15-20 metres away at this time but he then moved towards the group. He was about 5 metres closer when he saw Eden trying to escape and he saw him fall before reaching the driveway. He said ""they"" continued punching him whilst on the ground. He then saw two or three of the young males run across the road as the rest continued to beat him.

22KC said that he was in shock at what was taking place and without apparent regard for his own safety he intervened with the male who had tried to line up the pole apparently, it appeared to him, to hit Eden whilst at the same time a chubby male was trying to push Eden down. KC in an endeavour to assist his friend jumped at the male with the pole which sent the male off towards the road. He said he saw him and his mates run off.

(2) JE

23JE's evidence was that he identified the offender as one of four people punching and kicking Eden Delir. He said in evidence that before the assault upon the deceased commenced, a group of young men approached the deceased. One of that group he said distracted Eden whilst another struck him with a severe punch to the right side of his face. Very soon after followed an attack upon the deceased by four males. JE said that he heard a bottle break. He said that Eden Delir attempted to get away and that three of the four constituting the group to which he had earlier referred, chased him up the road. He said that before that, all four of them had been delivering punches and kicks to him.

(3) JZ

24Another Crown witnesses, JZ, stated that he saw Eden Delir walk towards the male who had called out to him and that person was at the same time walking towards Eden and he then pulled his cap or hat off and said, ""what's this?"" and then, or very shortly after that, another male came from around the side of a truck and hit Eden on the right side of the face. JZ said he then saw Eden fall to the ground. He heard Eden call out. JZ said he saw Eden ""stomped and kicked"" with blows to the back, his head, the lower part of his body and on his legs: T 729. He said that he thought it was after that that Eden was trying to get up off the ground that he was struck with the bottle, although his evidence indicates that he did not actually see the bottle strike the deceased.

25After Eden got up and commenced to run towards Cowpasture Road, JZ said he saw a male chase after him and take hold of his jacket a few times and then he lost sight of the two of them.

(4) TM

26TM said that at the party premises after the attack upon the deceased he was standing with LD-M when a male came up and asked for a cup of water. He said that this person had a cut along his hand (T 936) and was bleeding. TM later identified that person as the offender in a police photo array: T 936:21-26.

(5) LD-M

27LD-M said that he saw a group attacking the deceased and that one of the members of the group was the offender. He said ""they were just in like a circle formation, punching and kicking"": T681:30-35.

28LD-M knew the offender. They had been to the same school together. He said that the offender was two years older than he was: T 630:21. LD-M said that after the attack the offender came and asked him to get him some water. He said that this occurred when they were outside the house 'on the grass area at the top"": T 628:10. When LD-M asked the offender if he was alright, the offender pulled out his hand and he saw fresh blood on the palm of his hand. He asked SZ to get a cup of water: T 627-8. Also at 621:37-T 622:1-12.

29LD-M gave evidence of seeing the offender the next day at the KFC premises. He said they had a conversation. He said that in that conversation the offender asked ""Did anyone see us do it.""

(6) HA-H

30HA-H gave evidence that before the attack he saw the offender enter the house. HA-H said that he was at the front door when the offender walked past him: T 839:20-25. He said that he saw him pick up an empty bottle off the floor. He said that he saw the offender then go outside with the bottle to where he said his group of friends were: T 840:45-46.

31HA-H said that after seeing the offender leave he, HA-H, then went through to the back of the house and left: T 841.

Forensic Evidence

32There was evidence that established that the offender's blood was found on Eden Delir's cap. The Crown submitted that there was an irresistible inference flowing from that evidence, that the offender was involved in the attack, in particular, the assault on Eden Delir at the time of the attack or shortly thereafter. The blood on the cap, it was submitted, showed that the offender came into such proximity to the events that the deceased's blood was deposited on the fabric of the cap.

33Additionally, the offender was said to be bleeding from a fresh cut from the glass and that the only object that was capable of inflicting injury was the bottle which there was evidence the offender had been holding: Crown's Sentencing Submissions at [13](vi).

34Exhibit CK contained a transcript of a telephone intercept lawfully made by police on 28 November 2010. The transcript recorded a conversation on that date at 17:34:09 between SY (identified in the transcript as V2) and the offender (identified in the transcript as V3).

35The relevant extract was in the following terms:

""V3: Yeah. Hey listen: um, thing, bro -talk to, you know Natalia ...?

V2: Yeah, she was with me at the hospital just not long ago. She came here with me.

V3: Yeah, she's saying, she's saying, she's blaming me for that, that guy, that, ah, her cousin died or some shit.

V2: Why's she blaming you?

V3: I don't know. 'Cause remember how I hit him and shit, bro? She's saying, oh, it was me, this-that. Tell her, say, 'What the fuck are you blaming my cousin for, this-that.' Talk to her.

V2: Can I ask you a question?

V3: What?

V2: When you hit him, like...

V3: Yep?

V2: ...when you bottled him, did someone hit him after that? Like, were people hitting him...

V3: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

V2: But you stopped. Did you stop?

V3: Yeah, yeah. (Stutters) Oh, I just, I, I, I left after that - that's why."" (emphasis added)

36This telephone exchange, as I have earlier noted, was said by Mr Young to be open to interpretation and that the response ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"" was a response to the latter part of the question posed. However, whether that be so or not the jury were entitled to consider the offender's response to the question as adopting the opening premise or proposition in the question encapsulated within the words ""... when you bottled him ..."". The offender certainly did not seek to correct or reject SY statement.

37On the evidence, after the assaults upon him Eden Delir somehow managed to get up and run up the road. He entered the front yard of neighbouring premises.

38At about 9:40pm police attended the party and made inquiries about the whereabouts of the deceased.

39At about 10:30pm Eden was found lying unconscious down the side of a house further up Restwell Road.

40He was taken to hospital and remained in a coma following surgery. He passed away on 5 November 2010 as a result of head injuries sustained on 30 October 2010.

The Sentencing Hearing

41The Crown tendered a number of documents which together were marked as Exhibit A in the proceedings on sentence. Exhibit A includes the following documents:

(i) Victim Impact Statement of Ardavaz, Dorothy and Annabelle Delir.

(ii) Criminal antecedents of the offender.

(iii) The custodial history of the offender.

(iv) A Juvenile Justice report by Lobna Yassine dated 18 March 2014.

42On behalf of the offender the following documents were tendered:

(i) Exhibit 1: Report of Hanan Dover, Clinical and Forensic Psychologist dated 28 March 2014.

(ii) Exhibit 2: Letter of Susan French, school Principal, dated 14 February 2014.

(iii) Exhibit 3: Reference by Khalil Kamar (undated).

(iv) Exhibit 4: Reference by Ashoor Lazar, Parish Priest of Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East (dated 5 February 2014).

(v) Exhibit 5: Copy of bail undertaking given by the offender (undated).

43Subsequent to the hearing Mr Young provided to my Associate a copy of the report from Juvenile Justice dated 22 May 2014 by Annika Ross and Sarah Abusharif. A copy of that report has been tendered today and is admitted into evidence.

The Basis of the Crown's Case

44The Crown case at trial in relation to the offence of murder, and the implicit alternative count of manslaughter, was as follows:

(a) The Count of Murder

45The Crown conducted the trial as to the offence of murder on the following bases:

(i) Direct responsibility murder;

(ii) Joint criminal enterprise murder; and 

(iii) Extended joint criminal enterprise murder.

(b) The Alternative Count of Manslaughter

46As to the alternative verdict of manslaughter, the Crown relied upon the following bases:

(i) Direct responsibility manslaughter; and

(ii) Joint criminal enterprise manslaughter.

47In relation to the alternative verdict the jury was instructed that the two elements for the offence of direct responsibility manslaughter were:

(i) That there was a deliberate act by the accused (the offender) which caused, or substantially contributed to death; and

(ii) That this act was unlawful and dangerous.

48In sentencing the offender it is necessary to identify the basis upon which the jury determined its verdict. This issue was the subject of close attention in the submissions on sentence. By reason of its importance it is necessary that I refer in these remarks to the basis upon which I have determined that issue.

The Basis for the Jury's Verdict of Manslaughter

(i) Submissions for the Offender

49Mr Young SC who appeared on behalf of the offender submitted that the jury's verdict of manslaughter was based on a finding that the offender committed an unlawful and dangerous act, in that he participated in an assault involving punching and/or kicking the deceased, not done in self-defence and in circumstances where objectively there was a real risk of serious injury.

50Mr Young relied upon his written submissions dated 2 April 2014 and his Outline of Additional Submissions on Sentence dated 23 April 2014 supplemented by his oral submissions.

51Mr Young noted that the Crown at trial referred to various pieces of evidence that supported the conclusion which the Crown argued the jury would reach beyond reasonable doubt - that the offender struck the deceased on the head with a bottle with such force that it shattered. It was argued by the Crown at trial that such conduct enabled the inference to be drawn that the offender intended to cause grievous bodily harm. Mr Young further observed that the learned Crown Prosecutor repeatedly used the phrase in his address to the jury ""what did he think was going to happen"". 

52It was contended for the offender that the jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that if the bottle caused the injury to the back of the deceased's head, it was the offender who did it: Outline of Submissions on Sentence on Behalf of the Offender at [4].

53It was additionally submitted for the offender that the jury could not have accepted that if the offender joined in punching and/or kicking, it was done with the intent to inflict really serious injury.

54It was noted by Mr Young that there were no admissions by the offender as to his participation or role in the assault available to the Crown at the trial.

55It was further submitted:

""In the background report of 18 March 2014 signed by Ms Lobna Yassine and Ms Sarah Abushariff, (Ex ""A"") the offender was reported as saying that he became involved in punching and kicking the deceased, along with his co-offenders. (page 1, para 3) Further, he denied 'using any object/weapon to assault the victim'. (page 1, paragraph 3)

This version remains reasonably open to the evidence and is not susceptible of being rejected as fanciful, or self-serving to the point of incredulity.

It accords with the evidence of a witness who knew the offender, and described his being involved in punching and kicking the deceased. (D-M 630 2)."" (Submissions on Sentence of Behalf of the Offender at [8]-[10])

56In the Outline of Additional Submissions on Sentence on Behalf of the Offender dated 23 April 2014, Mr Young observed, in relation to ""use of a bottle"":

""(1) If the Court was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender struck the deceased on the head with a bottle causing it to shatter this would amount to an 'aggravating feature' for the purpose of sentence.""

57In his Additional Submissions Mr Young referred to the relevant principles as stated in R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-8 which were quoted with approval in Cheung v R (2001) 209 CLR 1 at 12-13.

58I will return to consider these principles and, in particular, the requirement that there be consistency of sentencing in accordance with the jury's verdict. 

59In his additional submissions Mr Young observed that no witness gave direct evidence of seeing the offender strike the deceased over the head with a bottle, though a number heard the sound of breaking glass.

60Mr Young noted that the offender was said to have been seen with a bottle inside the house and to carry it outside. Further, there was evidence that he is said to have had blood on his hand after the incident and further that the offender's blood was found on the deceased's cap.

61Mr Young submitted that the conversation captured by a telephone intercept between the offender and SY on 28 November 2010 (part of Transcript at Exhibit CK) is ambiguous, and is capable of explanation other than it being an admission.

62Mr Young referred to the Crown opening which was on the basis that the offender ""went smashing the bottle on Eden's head, cut himself"". Further, the learned Crown Prosecutor observed that this was the basis for ""direct responsibility murder"" in the Crown case.

63In the Crown's closing address the Crown addressed the jury in relation to its contention that the offender directly intended grievous bodily harm: 

""The Crown alleges that he himself directly intended grievous bodily harm because during the course of the event he did something which was plainly indicative of that intention, because if you smash a bottle over someone's head, and at the same time that victim is being beaten by others who also have weapons, that is a person who is intending really serious bodily injury."" (T 1122:9-14)

64Mr Young further referred to that part of the Crown's address as follows:

""The Crown says that [JP] was participating in the joint criminal enterprise to assault Eden Delir with an intention to do grievous bodily harm, or that he reasonably contemplated in the course of an agreement to assault Eden Delir that one or more of his number might form an intent to cause really serious bodily harm, or in the absence of any joint criminal enterprise whatsoever, he, with the bottle, smashed it over the head of Eden Delir with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. (T1123:41-50)

So, these facts speak. You either have that intent when he smashed this bottle over the head of Eden Delir, or he shared an intent with his compatriots to inflict grievous bodily harm, or if he didn't, what was he thinking was going to happen?"" (T1123:49-T 1124:2)

65Mr Young in his additional submissions stated:

""The Crown did not make any submissions that the offender (or anyone else with whom he was in a joint criminal enterprise) could smash a bottle over the deceased's head yet be found guilty of manslaughter."" (Additional Submissions at [12])

66Mr Young observed that the jury were addressed on behalf of the offender on joint criminal enterprise manslaughter and it was put to the jury that that was a preferable way of viewing the Crown case. Mr Young stated that there had not been a submission that such a manslaughter verdict was available if there was a finding that the offender had broken the bottle on the deceased's head. Considerable time, it was submitted, was spent in an attempt to dissuade the jury from such a conclusion: at [14].

67Mr Young quoted the following passages from the summing up:

""So the question of intention. I think I mentioned in passing the obvious example you see someone hitting someone over the head with an axe, you could infer readily from that act that that person has intention to cause that person grievous bodily harm."" (Summing Up at p 30)

""So I only identify those (""lies"" topic, dealt with earlier) to illustrate how the Crown case is, notwithstanding there was no witness who could say the accused was the one that wielded the bottle, the Crown relies upon a series of facts called circumstantial evidence"". (Summing Up at p 32-33)

68These passages, it was submitted, are examples of how the Crown's case on murder was characterised to the jury.

69Mr Young submitted that the Crown's treatment of the question of the use of a bottle by the offender during the course of the trial was confined to direct responsibility murder. He submitted that there was never a suggestion of its use in the way alleged could support a verdict of manslaughter.

70The alternative basis of murder, joint and extended, were addressed by the Crown, but never in the context of having used a bottle.

71Mr Young further submitted that the evidence does not support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender broke the bottle over the head of the deceased.

72He submitted:

""20. In the light of the way in which the trial was conducted, to sentence him on the basis that proposition is established would be inconsistent with the jury's verdict and/or what was necessarily implied by the verdict.""

(ii) Crown's Submissions on the Issue of the Basis of the Jury's Verdict

73The Crown relied upon its written submissions dated 4 April 2014 and its Supplementary Written Submissions dated 23 April 2014 and its oral submissions.

74The Crown submitted that the jury's verdict did not arise out of opposing bodies of evidence that gave rise to irreconcilable division in the evidence necessitating resolution. Nor could it be said that the evidence involved the rejection of competing bodies of evidence. The verdict of manslaughter, the Crown contended, was one that logically arose from the evidence and the onus of proof. Consistently with the issues at trial and the jury verdict, it was submitted that the offender's intention was ""the material factor"".

75The Crown case was that the offender was one of a subset of youths who set upon the deceased assaulting him ""with weaponry"" involving ""a bottling"". His connection to the bottle, directly and by inference, was said to have been ""... critical at trial to his guilt"" and that it marked out his participation and role in the joint enterprise beyond reasonable doubt.

76The Crown submission was that the doubt entertained to the offender's guilt of murder was one as to the element of intent. The Crown case was not that he had an intention to kill. The evidence was that Eden Delir was struck once with the bottle not more than once, and that it smashed. 

77The Crown contended:

""It was not conduct involving multiple blows with a weapon which in other cases uncontroversially indicates the manifest specific intention. And last, his conduct fell for consideration in the context of a violent joint enterprise."" (At [5])

78It was submitted these essential facts provided the basis for the jury's verdict and which the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt:

79The Crown further submitted:

""Although the alternative of manslaughter was left upon a basis that JP was culpable as a member of the attacking group, employing fists and feet, or both, and not a weapon, the evidence on the whole established beyond reasonable doubt that there was one who used a bottle, and it was JP.

The court will be satisfied that it was the strike to the head with the bottle that proved to be the cause of the subdural bleeding and oxygen deprivation to his brain. Brain death and Eden Delir's mortality were the direct causal result."" (Crown's Submissions on Sentence at [7]-[8])

80The Crown also referred to the principles established in Cheung v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 1; The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; and R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-8, and I have had regard to the principles therein enunciated.

81The Crown stated that whilst a jury's verdict decides issues joined it does not decide all facts of possible relevance to sentencing but that it may be possible to infer that certain parts of the evidence must have been accepted: at [11].

82The Crown referred to the evidence adduced at trial which it submitted established facts to the requisite degree that in turn established the offender's role as involving ""direct liability"" for the deceased's death and not mere accessorial in that respect. I have referred to the evidence bearing upon that aspect.

83The Crown submitted:

""By all accounts the bottle resembled a wine or champagne bottle. It must have been struck with a great [deal?] of force, and although not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was done with intent to cause grievous bodily injury in satisfaction of an element of a criminal offence, it suffices to qualify as involving a frightening degree of wilful violence and it was malicious."" (Crown's Submissions on Sentence at [15])

84In this case, the Crown observed that the offence of manslaughter may give rise to multiple bases including provocation even though no basis had in fact been advanced as a hypothesis at trial: Supplementary Submissions at [3].

85Although it may be possible to determine that an argument must have been rejected in order for a jury arrive at the verdict that it did, the Crown submitted that that may not always be so: Supplementary Submissions at [4]. 

86In the present case the Crown contended that all that might be determined is that the jury verdict must be taken as a rejection of a finding that the offender comprehended (and in terms of direct liability, specifically intended) grievous bodily harm. Hence, the acquittal on the charge of murder: Crown's Submissions at [4].

87The Crown submitted that the offender's state of mind was in issue and the evidence supported beyond reasonable doubt that the offender struck Eden Delir with a bottle to the head. The latter finding did not exclude a finding of something less than the contemplation of grievous bodily harm.

Principles

88It is necessary that I say something about the principles to be applied in relation to this aspect.

89The jury received written and oral directions on the offences of murder and manslaughter. Those directions in relation to each offence, as earlier indicated, identified the elements in respect of what was termed ""direct responsibility murder"" and ""direct responsibility manslaughter"" (additional to directions in relation to each on a joint criminal enterprise basis).

90The first of the two elements for direct responsibility murder and direct responsibility manslaughter were framed in identical terms, namely:

""(1) There was a deliberate act by the accused which caused, or substantially contributed to death.""

91The evidence in relation to that element for either offence was the subject of what I consider to have been significant evidence from a number of witnesses, namely, KC, JE, LD-M and HA-H. Leaving to one side, for the moment, the distinction between the offences of murder and manslaughter, their evidence was directly relevant to an issue that was common to either offence, namely, the question as to whether the offender was the person who committed a deliberate act, being the use of a bottle as a weapon striking the deceased on the head, which caused or substantially contributed to his death.

92The factual issue as to the identity of the person who struck the deceased with the bottle was a central factual issue in the trial upon which each of the above witnesses gave evidence of their observations and which evidence it was well open to the jury to accept. There was no attack upon any of the above three witnesses in terms of their truthfulness as distinct from the issue of the accuracy and reliability of what they said they saw and heard being tested.

93It must, in my assessment, be accepted that the jury were entitled, beyond reasonable doubt, to reach a finding that the assailant who smashed the bottle on the head of the deceased was in fact the offender. The evidence from a number of witnesses was consistent evidence and strongly implicated him. I conclude that the evidence did establish beyond reasonable doubt the offender as having been the assailant who struck Eden Delir with the bottle.

94A finding adverse to the offender on that issue then left for the jury's consideration the second element of the offence of murder, the issue of intent. If the jury was not satisfied that the evidence established that element - the requisite state of mind - to the necessary standard, then the second element of manslaughter would arise. The second element of both offences went to the question of mens rea or intent. Plainly the jury were not satisfied that the offender committed a deliberate act that caused or substantially contributed to the death of the deceased with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. However, the jury were instructed that they were entitled to find the offence of manslaughter proved if, in addition to the first element, the second element for the offence of manslaughter was established beyond reasonable doubt, namely, ""[t]he act was unlawful and dangerous"".

95The physical element for the offence of manslaughter is, of course, the unlawful and dangerous act which causes death. The mental element requires that the act must be willed and not accidental: Wilson v The Queen (1991-92) 174 CLR 313 at 328. To be found guilty of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, the circumstances must be such that a reasonable person in the position of an accused would have realised that he or she was exposing another or others to an appreciable risk of serious injury: Wilson (supra) at 332-4; Regina v KT [2007] NSWSC 83. 

96It was open to the jury to consider, in determining the issue of ""unlawful and dangerous"", all of the evidence as to the assaults committed upon Eden Delir including the hitting, kicking and the action of striking him on the head with the bottle. In the event that the jury determined beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was the person who wielded the bottle smashing it on Eden Delir, it was then plainly open to it to conclude that his action in doing so constituted an unlawful and dangerous act and that it caused or contributed to the death of the deceased. There is, in my opinion, no basis upon which it can be said that the way in which the Crown conducted its case excluded or precluded the alternative offence of ""direct responsibility manslaughter"" upon that basis. 

97I have accordingly concluded that it was open to the jury to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender so acted in striking the deceased with the bottle with an intent to cause an unlawful and dangerous act being an act that carries an appreciable risk of serious injury: Wilson v The Queen (1991-1992) 174 CLR 313 at 333 per Mason CJ, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. I am satisfied to the required standard that that was the basis for the jury's verdict of manslaughter.

The Objective Gravity of the Offence

98The maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no prescribed standard non-parole period.

99The offender is to be sentenced on the basis of an unlawful and dangerous act that caused the death of the deceased.

100In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter by way of unlawful and dangerous act, it has been said that there is no hierarchy of seriousness between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Spigelman CJ said as much in Regina v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184 at [29]:

""Even a case where there is present an intention to kill or maim, which would constitute murder but which is reduced, by reason of provocation or diminished responsibility, to a charge of manslaughter, will not necessarily attract a higher sentence than other forms of manslaughter, including the relevant one here, ie, killing by an unlawful and dangerous act. As a five judge bench of this Court, including Gleeson CJ, Mason P, Hunt CJ at CL, Simpson and Hidden JJ, said in R v Issacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381:

'The argument for the appellant advanced on this appeal appeared to assume that a case of provocation manslaughter is necessarily, or at least ordinarily, worse than a case of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. We do not accept that. Each case depends upon its own circumstances. The range of sentencing available in the case of manslaughter is notoriously wide. There have been cases where provocation manslaughter has resulted in non-custodial sentences.'""

101In determining the sentence in the present case, I am required to consider the objective and subjective factors relevant to the offence and the aggravating and mitigating factors in accordance with the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and relevant sentencing principles. I am, in particular, required by law to take account of a number of matters in determining the objective gravity of the offence committed by the offender and the other matters to which I have referred. The sentence to be imposed is one that is appropriate to the particular crime, having regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively: Regina v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354.

102Without setting out the provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I bear in mind that those provisions seek to identify the relevant objective and subjective factors that establish the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the offence.

103The evidence establishes that the offence of manslaughter in this case involved an unlawful attack involving a number of serious matters. These included the following:

(i) The act causing death occurred in circumstances in which a group of young males including the offender (approximately six in number) identified the deceased who was known to one or more of their number and a decision was then made to physically attack him as a group.

(ii) The attack had not been preceded on the day in question by any dispute or confrontation involving the deceased. He as an invited guest at the party was simply a participant enjoying a social occasion.

(iii) The member of the group who called Eden over clearly did so for the purpose of setting him up for a group attack.

(iv) The evidence as to the attack reflects a degree of co-ordinated activity amongst at least some members of the group - one called him over and distracted him by taking his hat/cap while another came in from the side and delivered a forceful blow to the right side of his head so severe as to knock him off balance.

(v) By that stage, when their victim was in a wounded and vulnerable position, the members of the group moved in to jointly inflict a series of violent attacks involving punching, stomping and kicking the deceased to various parts of his body inflicting further injury upon him thereby rendering him even more vulnerable and unable to defend himself.

(vi) At some point after the joint attack commenced the offender struck the deceased with a blow to his head using the bottle as a weapon smashing it and causing him to fall to the ground. The bottle, I find was the empty bottle which HA-H said he had not long before seen the offender pick up from the floor of the house.

(vii) Notwithstanding that Eden Delir was by this time very seriously injured, members of the group, of which the offender was one, continued to carry out further assaults upon him with one or more members of the group endeavouring to hold him as he desperately attempted to escape.

104Those facts establish that the multiple and severe assaults upon Eden Delir constituted brutal, co-ordinated joint criminal activity that was unlawful, dangerous and cowardly. The fact that Eden Delir was outnumbered approximately six to one, that the attack was without any warning and was unprovoked and that the combined attack then continued upon an increasingly injured young man through kicking and punching, and then by the smashing of the bottle over his head, underlines the complete callousness of the attack that subsequently brought about the death of a young person approaching the threshold of young adult life.

105This was not, in other words, a case merely involving a spontaneous act. The objective seriousness of the offence in this case is much greater than those all-too-frequent cases where someone is punched to the head and falls to the ground and dies as a result of injuries sustained. The objective seriousness of this manslaughter cannot, in my assessment, be characterised as anything other than extremely grave. The actions of the offender, before the attack, in picking up the bottle in the house and taking it outside, convey a serious element of calculated conduct on his part.

Subjective Facts

106The offender did not give evidence at trial or in the sentence hearing. Accordingly, the source of information in relation to his background is derived from materials that were tendered and that became exhibits in the proceedings.

107The offender, now as I have stated, 18 years of age, is the eldest of three children, their parents being of Assyrian ethnic background. His father is said to have arrived in Australia in 1992 on a refugee visa whilst his mother migrated to Australia from Syria in 1994. The offender was born a year later.

108The offender appeared to have little difficulty with his schooling in primary school but struggled with his education and learning in high school. His attendance at school appears to reflect those difficulties as his attendance record deteriorated. Ms French, the Principal at the offender's school, noted that he brought low academic skill levels to high school. She said that as with many who had low literacy and numeracy, he acted out with his peers and teachers, resulting in three suspensions in year 8, one in year 9 and three in year 10. The suspensions were imposed as a response to abusive behaviour, intimidation and aggression. Each suspension was said to have been resolved satisfactorily and his behaviour improved.

109Following his arrest, the offender transferred to Sydney Distance Education High School to complete the School Certificate which he completed in 2011.

110Ms French said that on visiting the offender in his home, his capacity to care and show empathy for others was immediately obvious demonstrated by his interaction with his mother and sister.

111Ms French referred to other favourable qualities exhibited by the offender.

112A Background Report by Lobna Yassine, Counsellor, and Sarah Abusharif, Assistant Manager (Clinical) of Juvenile Justice, was tendered and admitted as part of Exhibit A.

113No issues of family neglect or abuse were reported. Indeed, it is apparent that he has a supportive family.

114The report confirms that the offender has no prior convictions, that is, no previous Juvenile Justice history.

115Since being in custody the offender has participated in four educational subjects and is reported as progressing well and there have been no behavioural difficulties.

116The authors of the report record that the offender stated that he often empathises with the victim's family and reported a feeling of being overwhelmed by the sadness of their loss.

117The forensic medico-legal report of Ms Hanan Dover, Clinical and Forensic Psychologist, dated 28 March 2014 was based upon examinations carried out on 16 August 2013 and 12 October 2013 and the materials referred to in her report.

118Ms Dover stated that he reported episodes of anger and aggression and poor impulse control but could not explain the incidents in detail nor had adequate insight except to admit that he may need help with respect to his anger.

119Ms Dover assessed his general intellectual ability with a Full Scale IQ of 71 which is in the borderline range. She also assessed his verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning, the former being in the extremely low range and the latter in the borderline range. She assessed his general cognitive ability as in the borderline range. She opined that he had significant impairment of intellectual functioning ""which leads to a lack of understanding and insight into the consequences of one's own behaviour"". 

120I have read and taken into account the testimonials or references from Parish Priest Ashoor Lazar of 5 February 2004 (Exhibit 4) and that of Khalil Kamar, undated (Exhibit 3).

121There is evidence, as I have stated, in the Juvenile Justice Report to expressions of sadness by the offender for Eden Delir's family. I am prepared to accept that he has some remorse for what has occurred although it is difficult on the evidence to assess the extent or level of such remorse.

Sentencing Juvenile Offenders

122In sentencing an offender I am first required to take into account the objective seriousness of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the offender and the special sentencing considerations applicable to young offenders.

123Because of his age as at the date of the offence, 15 years, the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 are, for sentencing purposes, applicable.

124Section 6 of that Act sets out ""principles"" to which I am required to have regard. In particular, the youth of an offender is a relevant factor in the sentencing consideration, to be given the appropriate weight, together with all other relevant factors. The above principles in their application will, of course, depend upon the nature of the offence charged as well as the age and conduct of the offender: R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182; R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58.

125In R v Pham & Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 Lee J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Hunt J (as his Honour then was) agreed) stated in the context of offenders respectively aged 17 and 19:

""It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court's function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes."" 

126The principles that apply in the sentencing of young offenders were set out in KT v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 51 by McClellan CJ at CL at [22]-[25].

127Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. It has been noted that there remains a strong public interest in deterring antisocial conduct.

128In KT v Regina, supra, it was stated that the emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when a young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself, and has committed a crime of violence of considerable gravity. In determining whether a young offender has engaged in ""adult behaviour"" the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or premeditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence. Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society. In the present case, as I have noted, on the finding I have earlier made there was the use by the offender of a bottle as a weapon, there was very limited premeditation, commencing at or just prior to the offender picking up the bottle, the circumstances of the offence to which I have referred, and the fact that the offender does not have a criminal history.

129In JT v R [2011] NSWCCA 128 Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) was not persuaded in that case involving an offender who was 16 years and 7 months at the time of the offence, that it was the sort of offence which indicated impulsivity and immaturity on the part of the applicant so that the need for rehabilitation should be given paramount consideration. Rather, his Honour said, it was the very sort of offence that was referred to in KT at [24] and [25].

130The weight of authority is that the seriousness of an offence is relevant to the emphasis that can be given to the youth of an offender. It has been observed, however, that that does not mean that youth is not an important consideration; but retribution and deterrence cannot, in a case as serious as the present case, give way entirely or even substantially to the interests of rehabilitation: JM v R [2012] NSWCCA 83 per Simpson J at [108] (dissenting but not on this point).

131In a case such as the present where there was a use of extreme violence occasioning death and occurring in the circumstances to which I have referred, general deterrence and retribution cannot be ignored. 

132The factors to which I have referred in the sentencing of juvenile offenders, often pull in different directions. That is particularly marked in this case. The offender was in his mid-teens and has no criminal history. Allowance must be made for his immaturity. He has rehabilitation prospects although it is difficult on the evidence to say how strong those prospects are. Much will depend upon his capacity to free himself from peer groups with so-called normalised views on violence and the success of intervention strategies that provide insight about his use of violence as noted in the Juvenile Justice Report, part of Exhibit A.

133This is a case where individual deterrence and to a lesser extent, general deterrence, must be properly taken into account. The extreme level of violence, unprovoked, the use of the bottle as a weapon on a highly vulnerable victim as part of a calculated group attack upon him, mark the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced, as an extremely grave one and one that cannot be categorised as the crime of a child.

134In determining sentence I have considered a number of sentencing decisions which I do not reproduce here. I attach to these remarks a list of the decisions to which I refer. 

135Given the various circumstances of each case they do not, of course, establish any particular pattern of sentencing.

136By reason of the particular matters associated with the objective gravity of the offence, the sentence I propose to impose is a substantial one.

Special Circumstances

137I have considered the question as to whether there is a basis for a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 so as to vary the relationship between the non-parole period, and the head sentence. In that respect I have considered the personal and subjective matters to which I have earlier referred.

138I have determined that the offender's age, and the absence of a history of previous juvenile offending, provide a basis for a finding of special circumstances for the purpose of the above provisions.

139However, although I have made such a finding it does not, in my assessment, permit a reduction of the non-parole period to a level that does not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and the culpability of the offender after regard is had to all relevant circumstances: Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247; R v West [2011] NSWCCA 91.

140Accordingly, for those reasons on the special circumstances finding I have made I intend to provide a very limited adjustment only to the statutory ratio, namely, the ratio of the non-parole period to the total term.

Victim Impact Statement

141A Victim Impact Statement prepared on behalf of the parents and sister of Eden Delir was received by the Court. The statement expresses in clear and dignified terms the grievous effect and the immense loss of the life of Eden Delir has had upon each of them. The loss of a young person in the circumstances with which this case is concerned are exceptionally painful and tragic. On behalf of the Court I extend my condolences to the family of the deceased for the immense loss that they have endured and will continue to endure. Nothing of course can address the immense loss that has occurred. I have dealt with the Victim Impact Statement in accordance with well established principles: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.

Sentencing as a Juvenile Offender

142In certain circumstances, if a court sentences a person under 21 years of age to imprisonment for an indictable offence it may direct that the whole or any part of the term of the sentence be served as a juvenile offender: s 19(1) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.

143Section 19(3) of the lastmentioned Act provides that a person who is sentenced to imprisonment in respect of a serious children's indictable offence (as in the present case) is not eligible to serve a sentence of imprisonment as a juvenile offender after the person has attained the age of 18 years unless one or other of the matters set out in subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c) are satisfied.

144The eligibility to serve a sentence of imprisonment imposed in respect of a serious children's indictable offence as a juvenile offender after a person has attained the age of 18 years, in this case, would depend upon whether or not a finding of special circumstances can and is made under s 19(4) of the Act (in particular, subparagraphs (a) or (b) or (c) thereof). 

145Mr Young tendered information supplied by Juvenile Justice in a report dated 22 May 2014 upon the offender's participation in various courses conducted by juvenile correctional facilities.

146It is clear from that report and from the report of Ms Hanan Dover that the offender has significant intellectual disabilities that have given rise to the need for special educational programs. Ms Dover assessed the offender's general cognitive ability as borderline range observing:

""... those who score in the borderline range tend to also struggle with classroom and school environments. This was also reflective of his school reports and documents from the Department of Education ..."" (Report at p 6)

147The need for specialised educational programs for the offender is directly linked to his capacity to appreciate and gain insight into his use of violence as observed in the Juvenile Justice report by Ms Yassine and Ms Abusharif to which I have earlier referred. That report emphasises the need for the offender's special educational needs to be met by appropriate support and attention.

148The recent report from Juvenile Justice dated 22 May 2014, identifies the courses that the offender has undertaken to the date of that letter. The authors of the report note that a preliminary assessment has indicated that the offender has a reading age of 12.5 years, and that further assessment is ongoing. The report states:

""... this will assist with identifying areas of need and Girrakool School can provide one to one tutoring where the young person will be taken out of class for extra support if required.""

149The report further states that a ""longer term educational plan"" will be developed closer to the completion of his IT course. The report concludes:

""Mr de Joux advised that there is an extensive range of age-appropriate (adolescent) courses available to detainees.""

150The provisions of s 19(3) and 19(4) and (4A) were the subject of consideration in JM v R [2012] NSWCCA 83.

151As was made clear in that case, the provisions of s 19(4) and (4A) indicate that more than mere youth is necessary to permit a finding of special circumstances.

152On the evidence before me, more is present in this case.

153The evidence, including, in particular, that to which I have referred, bears directly upon the provisions of s 19(4)(b), namely:

""That the only available educational, vocational training or therapeutic programs that are suitable to the person's needs are those available in detention centres.""

154The evidence makes plain that the offender has special educational needs and that such needs require special rather than ordinary educational or vocational training that are otherwise available. Unless his educational needs as identified in the evidence are met, his capacity to gain insight and reintegrate into the community in the future will be impaired.

155The only issue which as I understand it that the Crown points to on this issue is that there is no express evidence to establish that there are no available educational or vocational training programs available in adult correctional institutions.

156The evidence establishes that juvenile detention centres, including in particular the Girrakool School has the capacity to provide one-to-one tutoring to provide what is referred to as extra and age-specific programs.

157I do not doubt that there are educational and vocational programs available in adult correctional centres. That, however, is not the point. A relevant matter in the present case is that the offender does have special needs requiring special education programs. The evidence in these proceedings permits me to draw the inference that appropriate one-to-one tutoring, though available to juvenile offenders who have learning impairment, is not available in adult correctional centres. The Crown, of course, is in a position to call evidence to the contrary if that were not the case. There is no contrary evidence that would prevent the inference to which I have referred from being drawn.

158A finding of special circumstances under s 19, of course, does not permit an order to be made that goes beyond the offender's 21st birthday.

159I make an order pursuant to s 19(1) and 19(3), directing that the offender serve his non-parole period as a juvenile offender until the day upon which he attains the age of 21 years.

160In sentencing the offender it is my intention that he be able to remain in a children's detention centre as a juvenile offender until the day he turns 21, whereupon he is to be transferred to an adult gaol.

161In relation to the provisions of s 15C of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act I note that no application has been made by either party, or any other interested party, for the usual statutory prohibition on the publication or broadcast of the name of the offender to be lifted on the event of being convicted of a serious children's indictable offence.

162Having considered the provisions of s 15C, I do not consider that an order should be made pursuant to s 15C(2) and accordingly it would be an offence for any person to publish or broadcast material that connects the name of the offender with these criminal proceedings.

Sentence

163JP you are convicted of the offence of manslaughter. I sentence you to a non-parole period of 7 years to date from 28 October 2013 and to expire on 27 October 2020. There will be a parole period of imprisonment of 3 years to commence on 28 October 2020 and to expire on 27 October 2023.

164Accordingly, the head sentence is a term of imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 7 years.

165The first date upon which the offender will be eligible for release to parole accordingly will be on 27 October 2020.

2764050,Thompson v DPP [2014] NSWSC 522,"Judgment

1This is an appeal from the decision of a magistrate conducting committal proceedings against the Plaintiff. The matter is sought to be brought to this Court pursuant to s 53(3) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""the C(A&R)A"") and by way of seeking prerogative relief.

The committal proceedings

2The Plaintiff has relevantly been charged with six offences against DH (a person aged 14 years at the time of the offences). There are four charges of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and two charges of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offences are said to have occurred between 1 January and 31 July 2007. 

3The Plaintiff had also been charged with offences against another young person, JJ, who was both the Plaintiff's nephew and also a friend of DH. Indeed, it is said that DH and JJ were in a sexual relationship at or about the time of the offending behaviour. Negotiations were entered into between the DPP and the Plaintiff's legal representatives in relation to the charges concerning JJ. Ultimately those charges were withdrawn and replaced with others to which the Plaintiff pleaded guilty. Those matters are listed for sentence on 13 October 2014. 

4At the committal proceedings on 19 November 2013 the Plaintiff made application under s 91 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (""the CPA"") for DH to attend the committal proceedings for the purpose of being cross-examined. In general terms, the reason for wanting him present was because of some inconsistencies between his evidence in an ERISP and a later statement he made on the one hand and a statement made by JJ on the other. 

5The Magistrate declined to make an order under s 91. That refusal has led to the present proceedings. 

6The Magistrate's decision was given on 17 December 2013. The summons commencing these proceedings was not filed until 10 March 2014. The proceedings are, therefore, brought within time insofar as they seek prerogative relief (see r 59.10 UCPR). However, to the extent that they are an appeal under s 53(4) of the C(A&R)A they are out of time. Such proceedings must be commenced within 28 days of the decision in the Court below (Pt 51B r 5(3) Supreme Court Rules 1970). Time may be extended by this Court at any time (Pt 51B r 5(5)). 

7The Defendant does not concede that an appeal is available under s 53 C(A&R)A and says, therefore, that an extension of time should not be granted for that appeal. Any question of the extension of time should await consideration whether such an appeal is available to the Plaintiff. 

8Section 91 of the CPA relevantly provides:

91 Witness may be directed to attend

(1) The Magistrate may direct the attendance at the committal proceedings of the person who made a written statement that the prosecution intends to tender as evidence in the committal proceedings. The direction may be given on the Magistrate's own motion or on the application of the accused person or the prosecutor.

(2) The Magistrate must give the direction if an application is made by the accused person or the prosecutor and the other party consents to the direction being given.

(3) In any other circumstance, the Magistrate may give a direction only if satisfied that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence.

9Section 93 of that Act provides:

93 Victim witnesses generally not to be directed to attend

(1) Despite section 91 (other than subsection (8) of that section), in any committal proceedings in which the accused person is charged with an offence involving violence, the Magistrate may not, under that section, direct the attendance of an alleged victim of the offence who made a written statement (even if the parties to the proceedings consent to the attendance) unless the Magistrate is satisfied that there are special reasons why the alleged victim should, in the interests of justice, attend to give oral evidence.

(2) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of any such special reasons.

10Section 94 defines ""offence involving violence"" and includes in sub-section (1)(a) ""a prescribed sexual offence"". A prescribed sexual offence is defined in s 3 and includes offences under s 61J and s 61M Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

The relevant evidence

11The Plaintiff does not dispute that sexual activity as alleged between himself and DH occurred. The only issue is said to be whether DH consented. Whilst that may seem surprising when DH was aged 14 years, it arises because of the terms of s 61J which makes consent an element of the offence notwithstanding that DH was under the age of 16 years.

12DH participated in an ERISP on 13 August 2007. He gave evidence of the first occasion when he said he was molested by the Plaintiff:

Q35. And how many times has he done this?
A. About four times.

Q36. O.K. 'Cause ! wasn't there when this happened I need you to, well first of all, when was the first time this happened?
A. Um, he texted me and said, he asked me, ""Do you want to go lapping with me"", with him [JJ] and my girlfriend which is Anthony's sister, Laura. And I said, ""Yes"", 'cause he said that he was going out and pick them up. And then, ah, he went and picked, [JJ] was already in the car and he didn't go pick them up, he took us, me and [JJ] out to the, out to the 10k out on the Sydney road and that was the first time.

Q37. O.K. And when was this, when did this happen?
A. Um, January.

Q38. January this year?
A. Yeah.

Q39. Do you know when in January this year?
A. No.

13DH said that JJ was present sitting in the front passenger seat. The Plaintiff got into the back seat of the car with DH and the sexual act took place. Elsewhere in the ERISP DH said that he was forced and threatened, and that he told the Plaintiff to stop. 

14JJ made a statement to the police on 31 August 2011. In that statement JJ said that he remembers that he was 15 years old when the Plaintiff returned from Queensland to live in Broken Hill. The Plaintiff telephoned JJ to tell him that he was coming back. He asked JJ if he had been having sex with anyone else while the Plaintiff had been gone. This was because, according to JJ, he and the Plaintiff had engaged in sex previously. JJ mentioned two other persons to the Plaintiff including DH. 

15The statement went on to say:

17. However, while I was still living with mum I remember [DH] (fourteen years) and I were playing a game on PlayStation 1 in my bedroom. Uncle Lenny arrived and came in to the bedroom. He said ""so this is [DH] that you've been talking about"". [DH] said ""so is this the Uncle you've been talking about"". I said ""yes"" [DH] said ""I've had it off with my Uncle too"". Uncle Lenny said ""do you want to suck my cock?"" [DH] said ""okay"". Uncle Lenny pulled out his penis and then [DH] started to suck him off. We all laid down on my bed; Uncle Lenny was in the middle. Uncle Lenny had his back to me and fucked [DH] and Uncle Lenny asked me to fuck him; Uncle Lenny was wanking [DH] off at the same time. [DH] came shortly after Lenny came in [DH] and then I came in Uncle Lenny.

18. We had three other threesomes like this (l was still fifteen and [DH] was still fourteen); two were at my Grandparents house in mine and Uncle Lenny's bedroom and another time was in Uncle Lenny's Kingswood out of town on the Adelaide Road. We were past the Speedway and turned left on to a dirt road and pulled over. We all had sex again. [DH] asked me for Uncle Lenny's phone number so I gave it to him; Uncle Lenny told me that he had sex with [DH] lots of times just the two of them.

16In the ERISP DH gives an account of the second occasion when he says that the Plaintiff had anal sex with him against his will. He said it was also out on the Sydney Road. JJ was again sitting in the front of the car. On this occasion he was forced to lie face down in the back part of the utility. The Plaintiff then had anal sex with him against his will.

17In a later statement of DH of 11 September 2012 he describes two further instances where the Plaintiff had anal sex with him. The first such further occasion was in the lounge room of a house on Williams Lane. The second further incident was also said to have taken place in the car or utility. On this occasion it was out somewhere off the Menindee Road. The sexual act took place in the back of the car while JJ went for a walk.

18In each case DH said that he was not consenting and that he made it clear to the Plaintiff that he was not consenting by telling him to stop doing what he was doing. 
19In his statement JJ described at least two sexual encounters involving himself, DH and the Plaintiff. One of these occasions took place in JJ's bedroom and another took place in a car. The statement indicates that these incidents were consensual all around. In his statement JJ also says that he was in a sexual relationship with DH. 

The Magistrate's reasons

20With that background the magistrate's reasons for refusing the application are these:

The defence is seeking to cross-examine the complainant about his relationship with JJ and about the complainant's first and subsequent encounters with the accused. On the first issue, I do not see how the complainant's relationship with JJ is in any way relevant to the issue of committal for trial. The fact that the complainant may or may not have been same sex attracted is no more relevant than if the complainant was a hetero-sexual female.

Likewise, the relationship that the complainant may have had with JJ is a separate and distinct issue than what may have happened with the accused although it does potentially provide some context as to how the accused and the complainant came to know each other. However, on the face of it, the relationship as between the complainant and JJ does not shed light on the issue of consent as between any sexual intercourse between the complainant and the accused. Likewise, the fact that JJ may have participated in and been witness to two consensual sexual encounters between the complainant and the accused, is not necessarily relevant. What is important is that the complainant has described in great detail four non-consensual encounters.

Even if I accept that there may be an inconsistency about the first sexual encounter between the accused and the complainant as described by JJ versus an encounter as described by the complainant, that is highly unlikely to damage the complainant's credibility sufficiently to warrant a discharge in relation to the contested charges. The prosecution case is that the complainant can remember four painful non-consensual sexual experiences where he told the accused person to stop. Even if I were to hear cross-examination and submissions querying why the complainant continued to see the accused, it is also unlikely to result in any discharge of the contested charges because I can foresee the following issues arising.

Firstly, that the complainant was about fourteen years old at the time of the alleged non-consensual encounters. Secondly, the complainant had continuing family problems and was probably in a continuing state of emotional distress. And finally, that the complainant had a close relationship with JJ. These issues combined could explain why he continued to behave in a manner which with the benefit of hindsight may be viewed as illogical. These are all things that a jury would have to consider for themselves and they are not in and of themselves or this particular issue is not in and of itself, likely to result in a discharge at committal.

A further reason that has been highlighted in submissions why the complainant should be called to be cross-examined at committal is that the defence feel that they have to satisfy an obligation under the rule in Browne v Dunn. I have heard submissions on this issue and it can be dealt with reasonably promptly or concisely in that I accept that the rule in Browne v Dunn does not apply to committal proceedings.

Another issue that has been raised in the defence application for the complainant to be called and cross-examined at committal is that there are some inconsistencies as between JJ's account and the complainant's account. The defence effectively would like to cross-examine as to those inconsistencies with a view towards seeking a discharge of the contested charges In that regard I accept the prosecution submissions that inconsistencies as between two witnesses such as JJ and the complainant are not necessarily special or unusual. In fact it is quite normal for there to be inconsistencies as between different witnesses in committal proceedings and indeed in summary proceedings.

The fact that there are these inconsistencies particularly with regards to the first encounter that JJ says he witnesses between the accused and the complainant, are simply issues that the jury will have to grapple with if the matter is committed for trial. They are not likely to be resolved at committal and they are not likely to result in such a finding of adverse credibility on the part of the complainant that the accused would be discharged in relation to the contested charges.

A further observation that I will make is that given the passage of time and the age of the witnesses involved, it is not at all unusual that they are not completely consistent with each other. And so whilst I do accept the submissions that there are many instances in which a magistrate can find special circumstances, I simply do not accept that this is one of those instances The case as it has been presented to me in the form of the prosecution brief and the submissions that I have received, it does not appear to contain anything that is out of the ordinary for these types of matters or at least not so out of the ordinary that they would be classified as special circumstances or circumstances which go beyond the norm that they would render it in the interests of justice that the complainant be called to give evidence and be cross-examined.

AND SO FOR THESE REASONS, ALBEIT THEY INELEGANTLY EXPRESSED TODAY, I DO REFUSE TO GRANT THE ORDERS SOUGHT BY THE DEFENCE. (emphasis added)

The Plaintiff's submissions

21The Plaintiff submitted that it was not reasonably open for the Magistrate to refuse the s 91 application. This was because the evidence before the Magistrate squarely raised questions about those aspects of DH's statements that asserted the sexual activity was not consensual. The evidence of JJ, which the prosecution did not seek to challenge at the committal, established either:

(a) the first instance of sexual activity between DH and the Plaintiff was consensual, or;

(b) there was no basis for the Plaintiff to know that it was not consensual, or 

(c) at a bare minimum there were irreconcilable inconsistencies between JJ and DH on the issue of DH's consent.

22Therefore, the Plaintiff submitted, the contradictions in the accounts meant that the only basis upon which the Plaintiff could have been committed for trial was if the accounts of DH were accepted without qualification and the account of JJ entirely dismissed. That was the only basis upon which there was a reasonable prospect that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, would convict the Plaintiff (ss 64 and 65 CPA).

23The Plaintiff further submitted that cross-examination of DH could have removed the possibility of any such unqualified acceptance and thereby created the possibility of the Plaintiff's discharge. 

24The Plaintiff submitted that the Magistrate's error, in failing to direct DH to be present for cross-examination, was compounded by what was said to be his misunderstanding of the appropriate test to be applied under ss 64 and 65. The Plaintiff drew attention to the Magistrate's references to the fact that the jury would need to ""consider"" or ""grapple with"" issues surrounding DH that he identified. 

25The Magistrate's role was a predictive role, the Plaintiff submitted. However, the Magistrate did not put himself in the shoes of the jury but rather abdicated his responsibility of considering or grappling with those matters on the basis that they were matters for the jury. In that way the Magistrate made an error of law in the approach he took the question of whether ""special reasons, in the interest of justice"" existed. 

26The Plaintiff submitted that on that basis there was a constructive failure on the part of the Magistrate to exercise his jurisdiction under ss 91 and 93 of the CPA. Further, that failure constituted an error of law and enlivens this Court's jurisdiction under both ss 53 and 55 of the C(A&R)A. 

27Argument was addressed both orally and in the written submissions about whether the Plaintiff was able to appeal under s 53 C(A&R)A. The issue is, as the cases on the point have discussed, whether a direction or a refusal to make a direction under s 91 of the CPA is ""an order"" made by a magistrate in committal proceedings: R v Colby (1995) 84 A Crim R 125; Nanevski v Haskett [2006] NSWSC 1114 at [25]. If, however, prerogative relief is available in any event, that matter may not have to be decided. 

Is prerogative relief available?

28A judgment that I have found to be of considerable assistance in relation to this Court's role in overseeing committal proceedings is Johnson J's decision in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v O'Conner [2006] NSWSC 458; (2006) 181 A Crim R 294. Although the case concerned an application by the DPP for relief and, therefore, involved s 57 of the C(A&R)A, Johnson J's analysis of s 69 Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) is entirely apposite for the present matter.

29He said:

[37] The Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief and relief in the nature of mandamus under s 69 Supreme Court Act 1970 with respect to the direction given by the Second Defendant on 8 February 2006 under ss 91 and 93 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The applicable principles on such an application were stated by Hunt J (as his Honour then was) in Waterhouse v Gilmore (1988) 12 NSWLR 271 at 276-278. In order to warrant the grant of declaratory relief in relation to committal proceedings, the circumstances must be ""most exceptional"" or some ""special reason"" must be shown: Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 25-26 and 81-82; Waterhouse v Gilmore at 277B. The undesirability of this Court intervening in committal proceedings has often been stressed: Waterhouse v Gilmore at 277B. A claim for declaratory relief is not to be used as a means of appeal except in special circumstances: Waterhouse v Gilmore at 277C-D.

[38] As committal proceedings are purely executive in nature, it has been held that a Magistrate's decision whether to commit for trial is not accessible to correction by this Court in the exercise of it supervisory jurisdiction at common law by way of prohibition or certiorari: Waterhouse v Gilmore at 275D-E. However, there is no obstacle to a grant of relief in the nature of mandamus under s 69 Supreme Court Act 1970 in relation to decisions given in the course of committal proceedings.

[39] When mandamus is sought to command the relevant court to reconsider the matter before it according to law, it is usual practice to seek certiorari also in order to quash the erroneous determination and thus clear the way for the fresh consideration and determination of that matter. An inability to grant certiorari in relation to committal proceedings, however, will not stand in the way of a grant of mandamus: Waterhouse v Gilmore at 276C-D.

[40] Relief in the nature of mandamus may be granted where there is an actual or constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction: Waterhouse v Gilmore at 276D-E; Saffron v Director of Public Prosecutions (1989) 16 NSWLR 397 at 399 and 418-420.

[41] The requirements of procedural fairness (including the audi alteram partem rule) extend to committal proceedings and this Court may grant relief where denial of procedural fairness is demonstrated in that context: Tahmindjis v Brown (1985) 60 ALR 120 at 133-134.

[42] There have been a number of decisions of this Court where relief in the nature of mandamus, either with or without declaratory relief, has been granted with respect to an order under s 91 and s 93 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (or their statutory predecessors in the Justices Act 1902) either requiring the attendance of a witness to give evidence in committal proceedings or declining to make such an order: Foley v Molan (Levine J, 20 August 1993 unreported, BC9301863); TS v George (Studdert J, 14 April 1998, unreported, BC9802154); Hanna v Kearney (Studdert J, 28 May 1998 unreported, BC9803179); Leahy v Price (Adams J, 28 September 1998 unreported, BC9804950); Dawson v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWSC 1147 JW v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWSC 1244 O'Hare v Director of Public Prosecutions [2000] NSWSC 430 Lawler v Johnson (2002) 56 NSWLR 1 McKirdy v McCosker (2002) 127 A Crim R ;217 Director of Public Prosecutions v Rainibogi [2003] NSWSC 274 and Black v Director of Public Prosecutions [2003] NSWSC 442.

[43] In the alternative to these remedies, the Plaintiff seeks leave to appeal under s 57(1)(b) Appeal and Review Act upon a ground that involves a question of law alone and contends that the order under challenge is an order made by a Magistrate in relation to a person in any committal proceedings for the purpose of that provision. The application for leave to appeal falls to be determined under s 58(1) Appeal and Review Act. If leave is given, the Court may determine an appeal against an order referred to in s 57(1)(b) by setting aside the order and making such other order as it thinks just or by dismissing the appeal: s 59(2).

[44] ...

[45] The Court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction to grant relief under s 69 Supreme Court Act 1970 where a statutory appeal is available: Meagher v Stephenson (1993) 30 NSWLR 736 at 738-9; Hill v King (1993) 31 NSWLR 654 at 656 and 658-9. However, such a course is not mandatory. Even where a statutory avenue of appeal was available and may have been preferable, the Court has granted prerogative relief: Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Farley (2001) 51 NSWLR 494 at 500-501 (para 24)....

30In the result, Johnson J at [100] made an order in the nature of mandamus and an order quashing the direction given by the magistrate. He said it was, in the circumstances, not necessary to make a declaration nor to consider whether a statutory review was available under s 57.

31Other cases demonstrate clearly that prerogative relief is available in ""appeals"" brought to the Court by defendants in committal proceedings: O'Hare v Director of Public Prosecutions [2000] NSWSC 430 at [54]-[63]; Sim v Magistrate Corbett [2006] NSWSC 665 at [19]; Dawson v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWSC 1147 at [30]. In addition, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Colby said that administrative law relief was available as an alternative (in that case, to a s 5F application) for consideration of a magistrate's determination under s 48AE Justices Act 1902 (NSW), a predecessor to s 93 CPA. 

32It is clear, however, from all of these cases that relief will only be granted where there has been an actual or constructive failure by the magistrate to exercise jurisdiction under the relevant Act. It will not be sufficient for the Plaintiff to show an error of law. It will only be jurisdictional error if the magistrate makes a decision outside the limits of the functions and powers conferred on him or does something which he lacks power to do. Incorrectly deciding something which he is authorised to decide is an error within jurisdiction: Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [163].

Appeal under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act

33It may be accepted that a Plaintiff in an appeal under s 53 would need to show only an error of law.

34Section 53(3) provides:

Any person against whom: 

(a) an order has been made by a Magistrate in relation to the person in any committal proceedings, or
(b) an interlocutory order has been made by the Local Court in relation to the person in summary proceedings,

may appeal to the Supreme Court against the order, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone, and only by leave of the Supreme Court.

35In Nanevski McClellan CJ at CL said:

[25] As I have indicated the plaintiff claims relief pursuant to s 55(3)(a) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and for that purpose seeks leave pursuant to s 54(1) of the Act. Although the matter was not fully debated before me it would seem that there are significant questions as to whether relief is available under this section. The relevant appeal is that provided by s 53(3)(a) which provides that a person ""against whom ... (a) an order has been made by a magistrate in relation to the person in any committal proceedings"" may appeal, with leave, to the Supreme Court. To my mind no relevant order has been made. The magistrate has declined to require certain persons to attend for cross-examination but this would not qualify as an order in relation to the person in committal proceedings: see R v Colby (1995) 84 A Crim R 125 at 128 (per Gleeson CJ) and Director of Public Prosecutions v Schebel (2004) 145 A Crim R 576 at 584-5.

36The Plaintiff submitted that this statement does not have a solid foundation. 

37In Colby Gleeson CJ (with whom Dowd J agreed) said at p 128:

What was involved in the present case was a ruling or decision in relation to an application for a direction. It is to be remembered that if the direction had been given it would not have had the legal effect of an order compelling the complainant to attend for cross-examination. A complainant in a sexual case might have very good reason for being unwilling to attend to be cross-examined on a witness statement in committal proceedings. If the complainant in the present case, after the making of such a direction, simply declined to give oral evidence, the consequence of that would have been that her statement would not have been available to be read in evidence by the prosecution. That in turn may well have resulted in a discharge of the applicants and a failure of the committal proceedings. 


38The Plaintiff submitted that the consequences of a failure to comply with a direction under s 48E of the Justices Act (the section under consideration in Colby) were very different to the consequences under s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act. That was said to be made clear in Colby in the above passage where it was said that the consequence of the complainant not attending in accordance with the direction would simply be that the statement would not be admitted into evidence. That might mean that the accused would be discharged because there was no evidence to commit the accused for trial. That is not the position under s 91 where it is still open to the magistrate to admit the statement into evidence notwithstanding the failure to attend or give evidence by the complainant. 

39If the distinction is relevant, which I doubt, it seems to me to work against the Plaintiff's argument. If the person directed to appear fails to do so, or appears but refuses to answer questions, it is still open to the magistrate under s 91 or s 93 to admit the written statement. In those circumstances the direction has less significance overall, particularly because the accused might still be committed notwithstanding the failure to appear or answer.

40 In Murdoch v Petterson [2005] NSWSC 1359 Grove J said at [12]: 

In its natural and ordinary meaning ""order"" does not encompass a refusal to make an order: R v Blakely ex parte The Assn of Architects, Engineers, Surveyors and Draftsmen of Australia 1950, 82 CLR 54.

There is a statement in Blakely to that effect by Fullager J at p 88. In turn, it provides support for the principle set out in Colby.

41Even if the decision in Colby is not strictly binding (because it deals with a different although similar provision, and because the issue was raised in connection with an appeal pursuant to s 5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)) I consider that I should follow it. It is difficult to see how the general statement of principle set out in Colby is distinguishable from the present inquiry. McClellan CJ at CL considered that Colby should be followed when considering s 53(3)(a) C(C&R)A. He reiterated that view in Steele v Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] NSWSC 926 at [39]. Independently, Grove J reached a similar conclusion on the point.

42I do not consider that I should do other than follow this line of authority. In those circumstances it is not necessary to consider the need for an extension of time.

Special reasons

43Section 93 of the CPA requires the Applicant to show special reasons in the interests of justice why the order should be made by the Magistrate. In B v Gould & Director of Public Prosecutions (1993) 67 A Crim R 297 Studdert J said at 302-303:

There can be no rigid definition as to what may constitute ""special reasons"" in the setting of s 48EA and the ""interests of justice"", whilst necessitating careful consideration of the interests of the defendant, cannot be limited to a consideration of his interests alone.

A defendant who wishes to cross-examine an alleged victim on committal must satisfy the magistrate to whom the application is to be made that there are special reasons for this course to be adopted.

The reasons must be special to the particular case. There must be some features of the particular case by reason of which it is out of the ordinary and by reason of which it is in the interests of justice that the alleged victim should be called to give oral evidence. It cannot be enough that the defendant would be prejudiced if the alleged victim is not called. Plainly there would be prejudice to the defendant in every case where the offence is denied and where the defendant does not have the opportunity of cross-examining the alleged victim at committal.

The apparent strength or weakness of a prosecution case is a relevant matter. If the material placed before the magistrate suggests that there is a real possibility that if the alleged victim is subject to cross-examination the defendant will not be committed, that may in the particular circumstances afford special reasons to require the alleged victim's attendance for cross-examination. For instance, where identification of the offender is a live issue and it depends solely upon the alleged victim this may constitute special reasons to require cross-examination of the alleged victim at committal.

Again, if the alleged victim has given more than one version of an alleged offence and those versions are inconsistent, this may warrant that the alleged victim attend for cross-examination under the section. I would caution however that the possibility always exists that a witness will be discredited and his or her testimony may be broken down in cross-examination. A recognition of that possibility and the confidence that the potential cross-examiner may express as to what may happen if he is given the opportunity to cross-examine could not of itself suffice to afford ""special reasons"".

It may be that a particular alleged victim is willing to give evidence at committal and desirous of doing so. In such a case a magistrate might readily find ""special reasons"" exist.

44In R v Kennedy (1997) 94 A Crim R 341 Hunt CJ (with whom Grove J agreed) said at 352:

What are ""special reasons"" and what are not will vary from case to case and cannot be defined in advance. The decision should not be approached in an unduly restrictive way; what must be shown is that such evidence will serve the true purposes of committal proceedings, which exist in order to achieve a fair trial in the trial court. Something more than the disadvantage to the accused from the loss of the opportunity to cross-examine the complainant at the committal must be shown. There must be some feature of the particular case by reason of which it is out of the ordinary and which establish that it is in the interests of justice that the complainant be called to give oral evidence. Two cross-examinations are not justified simply in order to find material in order to discredit the witness at the trial.

Solid grounds must be disclosed for supposing that the cross-examination will make a significant contribution to the achievement of a fair trial. The clear message conveyed by all of the cases which I have read is that cross-examination at the committal proceedings will be permitted only where there is at least a serious risk of an unfair trial if it is not. That is, incidentally, the test to be applied before permitting a Basha inquiry, and it is not without significance that this Court's decision in Regina v Basha has been cited as relevant to the interpretation of the similar South Australian provision. It has already been held that a cross-examination at the committal would be justified where the complainant's statement was vague as to the dates upon which the assaults were alleged to have taken place and where the cross-examination was limited to pinning the witness down so far as possible in relation to those dates. That decision is directly applicable in the present case.

45In Goldsmith v Newman and the State of South Australia (1992) 59 SASR 404 King J, when discussing what amounted to special reasons in relevantly similar legislation to s 93 said:

It may be helpful to magistrates to indicate some circumstances which may amount to special reasons.

1. It may appear that there is sound reason to suppose that some degree of cross-examination will eliminate possible areas of contention and refine the matters really in dispute.

2. Cross-examination may be desirable to establish important facts as the foundation of a defence or to eliminate any possibility of a particular defence. For example, it may be important to ascertain from witnesses in advance of trial whether the defendant showed signs of intoxication or irrationality at relevant times.

3. It may be necessary for a fair trial that the defence have a limited opportunity to explore in advance of trial key issues which may be relevant to possible defences such as bona fide claim of right or duress.

4. In some cases some limited questioning of scientific witnesses may be necessary to explore possible avenues of inquiry as to alternative hypotheses, or the need for further testing or analysis.

5. There may be reason for dissatisfaction with the extent of prosecution disclosure by filing statements and documents pursuant to s 104 or otherwise, and cross-examination may appear to be the best way to obtain such disclosure.

46Special reasons have been demonstrated where a complainant has provided inconsistent accounts of the offending: Moussa v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2010] NSWSC 476; Leahy v Price (Supreme Court of NSW, Adams J, 28 September 1998, unreported).

47In Abdel-Hady v Magistrate Freund [2007] NSWSC 1247 at [44] Rothman J thought that the avoidance of a Basha inquiry must, without more, be a substantial reason in the interests of justice as far as s 91 is concerned. Similarly, in Dawson v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWSC 1147 Hulme J said at [25] that a Basha inquiry was no substitute for the proper conduct of committal proceedings.
48Even where there are inconsistent versions of events that may not be sufficient to justify special reasons being found. Where it is not clear what version of events will be advanced as the case for the accused to meet then special reasons may be demonstrated: Boumelhem v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2002] NSWSC 1046 at [23].

Did the magistrate err?

49In my opinion the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that there are special reasons in the interests of justice that DH should be required to attend for cross-examination. The case that the Plaintiff must meet, as the Magistrate identified, was the fact that on the four occasions alleged (three in the car and one at Williams Lane) there was non-consenting sexual intercourse between the Plaintiff and DH. It would not necessarily follow that, if DH was mistaken about the first occasion on which he had sex with the Plaintiff that would mean that a jury would not be able to convict of the offences charged. In my opinion, the Magistrate was quite correct to say that even if he accepted that there was an inconsistency about the first sexual encounter between the Plaintiff and DH as it was described by JJ, that was unlikely to be such as to damage DH's credibility sufficiently to warrant a discharge in relation to the four occasions DH has described in some detail. 

50The criticism made by the Plaintiff about the Magistrate's approach to his obligations under ss 64 and 65 seem to me to be misplaced. The judgment now under review was not his reasons for committing the Plaintiff for trial. Rather, it was a consideration of the application before his Honour concerning whether DH should be required to attend to be cross-examined. Certainly, he was required to consider whether cross-examination of DH was likely to result in the Plaintiff's discharge because DH's credibility was so impaired that there was no reasonable prospect that the jury would convict.

51However, I do not read his Honour's remarks about what the jury would need to do as being anything less than a proper consideration of matters that informed his opinion about whether special reasons had been demonstrated for requiring DH to be required to attend for cross-examination. In that regard his Honour was in a position of some difficulty. At this point he had not been asked to commit the Plaintiff for trial. It would have been inappropriate for him to express final views about whether a reasonable jury, properly instructed, would be likely to commit. On the other hand he was required to consider if cross-examination of DH, with the result contended for by the Plaintiff, was likely to mean that the Plaintiff would be discharged.

52His Honour's statement that I have highlighted in the extract at [20] was a fairly clear indication that any credibility issue raised by cross-examination was not likely to result in a discharge. On the credibility issue, therefore, the magistrate was doing exactly what ss 64 and 65 required of him, and what was required of him on the s 93 application.

53For the Plaintiff to establish jurisdictional error he would need to demonstrate that there was only one answer that was reasonably open to the question whether DH should be required to attend to give oral evidence: McKirdy v McCosker [2002] NSWSC 197 at [37]. If I concluded only that the Magistrate came to a different view from the view to which I would have come, that would only be an error within jurisdiction: McKirdy at [36]. 

54I cannot conclude that the only answer to which the Magistrate ought to have reached was the giving of a direction for DH to attend to be cross-examined. The Magistrate provided cogent reasons for the view to which he came. He was correct to say that the issue he had to consider for the purposes of committal was whether a jury was likely to convict in relation to the four non-consensual occasions of which DH gave evidence in his statements. The fact that he might have been in a sexual relationship with JJ, or might at other times have had consensual sex with the Plaintiff (whether or not also with JJ), or whether or not he might be mistaken about when the first time was that he had sex with the Plaintiff, are not matters that in themselves would likely lead to the Plaintiff being discharged. 

55The Plaintiff said on a number of occasions that the Magistrate had two irreconcilable accounts on the issue of consent. That was not in fact the case. DH does not in fact give evidence of the occasion that JJ speaks of that I have set out in [15] above. On each of the occasions DH describes that go to make up the four charges he says that JJ was not involved. On the third occasion, when the sex took place in the lounge room of the house on Williams Lane, DH says that he cannot remember what JJ was doing ""but he was not involved"". He said he would usually be on the computer. It seems clear, therefore, that the occasions that DH is describing do not include the occasion that JJ describes in [15] above. 

56The Plaintiff's submissions contain the assumption that JJ's account and DH's account of DH's sexual involvement with the Plaintiff are irreconcilable. They may be, but there are other possible outcomes. DH, if cross-examined, may continue to assert that JJ is trying to protect his uncle as he said in his ERISP. DH may be accepted in that regard. On that basis the Plaintiff would likely be committed for trial. 

57DH may agree that he is mistaken about the circumstances of the first sexual encounter with the Plaintiff but maintain that the four occasions complained of nevertheless happened and that he was not consenting. There is some factual support for some of the occasions out on the road in JJ's statement of 6 July 2012 where he agrees that the Plaintiff had sex with DH but he (JJ) was not involved. JJ also says that he was not really interested in having threesomes with the Plaintiff and DH. DH may be believed about those occasions notwithstanding the mistake. On that basis the Plaintiff would likely be committed.

58The fact that a person consents to sex with a particular person on one occasion may say little about whether they were consenting on other occasions. Rape within marriage and intimate relationships is a well known phenomenon. Proof that DH had consensual sex with the Plaintiff on the occasion JJ reports does little to discredit DH's account of the other occasions. On that basis the Plaintiff would likely be committed.

59All of this is not to say that there are likely to be questions for the jury by reason of the differences I have referred to between DH's account and JJ's account. There is clearly material in DH's ERISP and his statement that provides fertile ground for a cross-examiner. These are not matters special to this case. These are the matters that arise in many, if not most, cases of this type.

60The learned magistrate properly considered the relevant matters. He did not apply a wrong test, nor did he misconceive the duty he had to perform: Saffron v Director of Public Prosecutions (1989) 16 NSWLR 397 at 418. Another magistrate may have come to a different decision but the magistrate's decision was open to him. There was not only one answer to the question to be considered. 

61Accordingly, I make the following orders:

1. Summons dismissed.

2. The Plaintiff is to pay the First Defendant's costs.

2764054,R v Briggs [2014] NSWSC 850,"Ex tempore Judgment
1HIS HONOUR: Objection has been taken by defence counsel to the admission of voice identification evidence from two witnesses, Mr Costin and Mr Ryan.  In the latter case it is not entirely clear whether the witness, according to his statement, is engaged in voice identification or, in truth, an assumption as to what he has heard.
2In a nutshell, the two witnesses were outside when it is alleged that the accused fatally assaulted the deceased inside a residential flat.  The facts in issue therefore are whether the accused assaulted the deceased, thereby causing his death, with one of the two necessary mental elements of intention for the crime of murder: see the judgment of Simpson J in Burton v R [2013] NSWCCA 335 commencing at [148].  
3It seems that there is no dispute on the part of defence counsel with regard to the first two elements.  Rather, there is a question as to whether the mental elements of murder can be established by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt.  It seems that the jury may well need to be directed about the question of intoxication, and also manslaughter by way of an unlawful and dangerous act.  It also seems likely that self-defence, at least in its excessive form, will need to be left to the jury.  
4According to his statements, voir dire exhibits B and C, Mr Costin heard a male voice from inside the flats say, amongst other things, ""I'm going to fucking kill you"" and ""Do you want to go again do you"".  Later, when the accused was arrested and being taken by police to a caged truck, Mr Costin heard the accused speak to police and ""positively recognised"" the voice of the accused as being the voice that he had heard from inside the apartment.  
5According to Mr Ryan's statement, voir dire exhibit D, he saw a man outside the units, and as I understand it there is no dispute that that man was the accused.  In [5] Mr Ryan describes hearing that man use ""slurred speech"" and ""talking loudly"".  Later, he heard a voice from inside the apartments say, amongst other things, ""I'm going to kill you"" and ""Do you want to do this again"".  One can infer from his statement - although it is true that the position is not entirely clear - that he identified the voice from the apartment as the voice he had previously heard emanating from the person of the accused.  
6In accordance with the authorities, the objection of defence counsel is not founded on any common law preconditions with regard to the admissibility of voice identification evidence: see R v Adler [2000] NSWCCA 357; 52 NSWLR 451 at 454-455, and R v Riscuta [2003] NSWCCA 6 at [34].   Nor is it founded on s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (""the Act"").  Rather, it is founded on the well-known balancing test in s 137 of that Act.  
7The Crown Prosecutor submitted that, in accordance with a plethora of authorities of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal (amongst them R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228, R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363, and the most recent case to which I was referred, Burton v R), it is now soundly established that questions of credibility, reliability, and weight are not for me at this stage in my approach to s 137 of the Act.  Rather, he submitted, I should undertake the well-known balancing exercise called for by that section on the assumption that the evidence is accepted.  In other words, he submitted that I should not assess the weight of the evidence in order to determine whether it may be accepted by the jury, and thereby determine its probative value.  Rather I should assume that it will be accepted, and thereafter assess its probative value in light of all of the foreshadowed evidence in the trial, along with the facts in issue that I have identified.  
8Defence counsel submitted that it must be the case that a trial judge should make some assessment of the true strength of the evidence at this stage, as part of the proper application of the section.  
9In discussion, I queried of the learned Crown Prosecutor whether, if it be the case that, for example, one of the witnesses is in truth very deaf, that is nevertheless something that should not be explored on the voir dire.  He confirmed that that is his submission.  
10Having taken some time to reflect on the question, I accept the position of the Crown Prosecutor.  Without analysing the different judgments in R v XY in detail, in summary the majority endorses the approach of Spigelman CJ in R v Shamouil.  
11In the very recent case of Burton v R, the analysis of Simpson J to like effect commanded the unanimous support of the Court of Criminal Appeal comprised as well of R A Hulme J and Barr AJ.  
12I respectfully consider that defence counsel is correct in his submission that the modern approach is not consistent with the approach taken by trial judges over many years with regard to the ""probative/prejudicial"" discretion at common law first enunciated in R v Christie [1914] AC 545.  Nor is it consistent, indeed, with the approach taken by trial judges over many years with regard to s 137.  
13Nevertheless, I consider that the position in New South Wales is now clear: questions of credibility, reliability, and weight, and indeed alternative explanations or inferences, are for the jury.  They are not for me at the stage of undertaking the balancing exercise contained in s 137 of the Act.
14Accordingly, any voir dire addressed to questions of weight and the like will be otiose.  It follows that cross-examination in that regard of the two witnesses will not be permitted.

		01 July 2014",2014-06-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764071,R v Cook [2014] NSWDC 165,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On 16 January 2013 the offender, Cameron Cook, committed a number of offences for which he must now be sentenced. Mr Watson, who appears for Mr Cook, accurately described what the offender did that day as ""a rampage.""

2The offender consumed a substantial quantity of alcohol and probably Xanax on the morning of 16 January. He then got on a motor cycle with another man. They first drew attention to themselves at about 1.45pm. A woman had parked her Ford Festiva motor vehicle in Gymea. She was in the car with her handbag on the front passenger seat. She watched, and so did others, as the offender arrived with his pillion passenger. The offender, then wearing a dark coloured vest with Rebels outlaw motor cycle group insignia on it, approached the woman and said, ""Can I have a bottle of water?"" When she replied ""I haven't got one"", the offender became aggressive. He yelled ""I want a bottle of water"" and began pushing hard on the driver's side window adjacent to the woman several times. This caused the vehicle to rock. Not surprisingly, the woman started to wind up the driver's side window because she feared for her safety. 

3At this stage the offender used his right hand to punch the driver's side window causing it to shatter and removed the remaining glass from the door frame and threw it onto the ground. He then raised his right fist again and this time he punched the woman to the right side of her face. She was seated in a motor vehicle. She had no opportunity to defend herself. It was a cowardly attack on a woman who had no idea that she was about to be struck. This caused her, not surprisingly, to feel pain. Her head was thrown backwards and she bit her upper lip. 

4The offender was not finished yet. He grabbed her face with his hands and ripped off her glasses. He then reached into the vehicle over the top of the now injured woman and removed her handbag. He then walked back to the motor cycle, passed the handbag to his pillion passenger who resisted attempts to recover the handbag, and they rode away. Fortunately passersby saw what was going on and contacted police, giving them the registration number of the motor cycle upon which the offender and his pillion were travelling. 

5What I have just described represents an offence of aggravated robbery, the circumstance of aggravation being that the offender inflicted corporal violence on the victim of the robbery immediately before it. There is also an offence of intentionally damaging property, namely, the driver's side window of the motor vehicle, on a Form 1 attached to the aggravated robbery offence. As the offender rode off he was seen to do so recklessly in a manner dangerous to the public. That is also an offence appearing on the Form 1 attached to the aggravated robbery offence. 

6The next particular occasion where the offender drew attention to himself was when he committed another offence, this time of demanding property with menaces. The victim of this offence was driving a motor vehicle. He came to a pedestrian crossing and stopped, allowing pedestrians to cross in front of his vehicle. He heard the sound of the offender's motor cycle coming up behind him. When the motor cycle got adjacent to the victim's car the offender yelled in at the victim saying ""Oi"". When the victim replied ""What?"" he was met with this demand from the offender, ""Give me your phone and wallet or I will shoot you"". Immediately, and again not surprisingly, the offender drove off. All of this was seen by police officers who had responded to the police radio broadcast following the offender's first offence. 

7The next thing that happened was the offender drove his motor cycle recklessly, I have already mentioned that matter as being on the Form 1, before the offender then went down to a boat ramp where there were a number of people fishing. One of those was a 65 year old gentleman by the name of Raymond O'Neill. The offender approached him and asked whether he had any jumper leads. Mr O'Neill told the offender that he did not. The offender repeated his request and Mr O'Neill turned his attention to his equipment, intending to go fishing. Without warning the offender punched Mr O'Neill to his head. Mr O'Neill fell to the ground where the offender began kicking into his body and his head. At one stage Mr O'Neill was able to grab the offender's leg. In response the offender then bent over and began punching Mr O'Neill in the head once again. He tried to get away, and almost got to his feet, when he went down again, he presumed because he had been hit once more. And then again the offender began to kick the unfortunate Mr O'Neill while he was on the ground. Mr O'Neill desperately tried to get away crawling 20 or 30 metres, all the time being kicked and punched by the offender. 

8At one stage whilst he was trying to crawl away from the offender, the offender said that he was going to shoot Mr O'Neill and kill him. Mr O'Neill thought that if that threat was carried out it was obviously ""all over"" for him.

9Eventually the offender stopped kicking and hitting Mr O'Neill. He went to seek assistance. He could not find anyone to assist him but when he walked back to where his car was he saw the police had arrived and the offender under control. 

10Mr O'Neill was left with injuries which clearly amounted to grievous bodily harm. He had fractures to an eye socket and swelling to his throat which affected his breathing and which required later draining. A photograph was tendered before me in the trial showing what Mr O'Neill looked like after the offender had finished with him. His face is covered in blood. There is a substantial quantity of blood on the shirt that Mr O'Neill was wearing. There is blood all over his left arm. He looks a mess. That the offender could hit Mr O'Neill once is bad enough, that the offender could kick him whilst he is on the ground once is worse, but for the offender to continue kicking, hitting and threatening Mr O'Neill reveals grave criminality indeed. That he could continue to do so despite Mr O'Neill being obviously injured represents criminality of the highest order.

11In his submissions today, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the offender's conduct as involving a horrendous, unprovoked, prolonged and vicious attack. Each of those adjectives is entirely accurate.

12As a result of that conduct the offender stands to be sentenced for an offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. There is one further offence for which the offender is to be sentenced as well. When he was on his motorcycle he was unlicensed. He has asked that I sentence him for that matter, the matter coming before this Court on a s 166 certificate. 

13All of the offender's wrongdoing came about over a relatively short period on 16 January 2013. It is the one rampage. The offender's conduct was largely inexplicable too. Mr O'Neill did nothing at all, apart from telling him that he did not have any jumper leads. The offender's response is in many respects bizarre. It is largely due to the very high level of intoxication affecting Mr Cook that day. I will return to that issue later in these remarks on sentence.

14The offender pleaded guilty to the aggravated robbery offence and the demand money with menaces offence at an early stage and so the sentence I impose upon him for those matters will be 25% less than they would otherwise have been. The offender did not plead guilty to the offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and a trial was held before me without a jury. Notwithstanding that circumstance, there was still a utilitarian benefit in the way the offender ran the trial. The issue for me to decide was very limited and concerned only the mental element - was I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Cook intended to cause grievous bodily harm. I found that he did and so the offender stands to be sentenced for that matter, but he is nevertheless entitled to a discount on sentence because of the utilitarian benefit which flows from the way the trial was run and the admissions that were made. The sentence I impose upon him for that offence will thus be 10% less than it would otherwise have been.

15These are obviously serious offences. That is demonstrated not only by a recitation of what the offender did, but also by consideration of the maximum penalties and, in one case, standard non-parole period. The maximum penalty for causing grievous bodily harm to a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm is 25 years. It has a standard non-parole period of seven years. The maximum penalty for the aggravated robbery offence is 20 years imprisonment and the maximum penalty for demanding money with menaces is ten years imprisonment. I have taken into account the maximum penalties and, where appropriate, the standard non-period in determining the appropriate sentences in this case. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence.

16The offender was born in Wagga in 1987. He has four brothers and four sisters. His parents separated when he was quite young, about the age of three, and he has had little contact with his mother from that time. His mother was, and may well still be, a heroin addict. 

17The offender was left in the care of his father but, and this is a matter of distress to the offender, he had limited contact with his father in his early years. His father was either away at work or involved in activities with an outlaw motorcycle gang and so the offender was largely raised by his paternal great aunt, a woman to whom he feels very close. Indeed, at the time of committing these offences he was her carer. He freely admits that he was not doing a terribly good job of being her carer, getting intoxicated and committing these offences on 16 January. 

18He has had problems with drugs and alcohol for some time. He commenced drinking at the age of 14. He became involved with ecstasy and amphetamines at 16 and escalated his drug use to involve cocaine and, more damagingly, ice at 18. He told a psychologist that his drug use was mainly recreational until about six months before these offences. What happened at around that time was that a very close friend committed suicide. Quite irrationally it would seem, the offender feels guilty about his friend's death. Although such feelings, as I have said, may be irrational, they appear to have been genuine, with the offender significantly upset by this tragic turn of events. In those circumstances he began to abuse drugs and alcohol and it was in those circumstances that he committed the offences which I must now sentence him. 

19There is no doubt he was very highly intoxicated at the time of these offences. Extracts from an interview with police were played to me during the trial and other extracts were read to me during the course of submissions today. It is clear that police did not interview the offender until he had sobered up and once they did, he learnt for the first time what he had done. His distress at learning of his behaviour and, more importantly, at learning of the harm he has caused was, I am satisfied, genuine. His remorse continues to this day. He told me that he felt disgusted about what he had learnt from police, could not believe that he had done those things and finds it difficult to put into words how bad he feels about such matters.

20The offender does have a criminal history but the only offences involving violence, of affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, occurred when the offender was a juvenile. There is nothing remotely approaching the seriousness of these offences on the offender's criminal history. 

21As I have already mentioned, the offender's bizarre behaviour can really only be explained on the basis that he was highly intoxicated at the time of his offences. It is to be noted that Parliament has recently amended s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that self induced intoxication is no longer a mitigating feature. This leads to a curious result in this case. The offender pleaded guilty to the aggravated robbery and demand property with menaces matters before 31 January, so the amendment to s 21A does not apply and so his self induced intoxication can be regarded as a mitigating feature for those offences. But I only found him guilty and convicted him on the more serious offence of causing grievous bodily harm with a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm after 31 January 2014 and so the amendments do apply to that offence. Thus, for that offence it is not a mitigating feature that the offender was intoxicated. 

22I will have to do what Parliament says I must do, despite obvious problems in the approach that Parliament has dictated. Why should I sentence the offender for the most serious offence as if he were stone cold sober? It was his intoxication which has caused him to act out of character, and yet the recent amendments say that I cannot have regard to that as a mitigating feature. I repeat I will do what Parliament requires that I do despite it making no sense to me at all. 

23I should note that the pillion passenger was also dealt with in relation to the offence of aggravated robbery, a parity issue arises. I note that he had a more significant criminal history, but on the other hand it is clear that the offender had the more culpable role. The pillion indeed was only charged with aiding and abetting the aggravated robbery and received a head sentence of three and a half years with a non-parole period of two years. I must have regard to that in order to ensure that the offender does not have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed on him for that matter with the sentence imposed on his pillion passenger.

24I should also mention that the offender was on a bond at the time under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That was a bond imposed for an offence of supplying a prohibited drug. I am not aware of what has happened in regard to that matter, whether he has been called up or if so what penalty was imposed by the Magistrate.

25The offender is, despite everything that I have said so far, an impressive young man. He gave evidence in an articulate manner. He is realistic about what he has done. He is deeply remorseful and has plans for the future. His plans for the future largely involve his family. At the time he committed this offence, although he did not know it, his partner was pregnant with their child. She has given birth to their son. I gather that this was something of a wakeup call to the offender who has now decided that he is determined to be a good father to his son, recognising that that will involve a significant change in his behaviour. He wishes, upon release from custody, to live with his partner and to bring up his son in a proper manner. He does not want to bring up his son as he was brought up.

26I should clear up one thing because of the suspicion that it attaches to members of outlaw motorcycle gangs such as that to which the offender's father belonged. Indeed the very use of the word ""outlaw"" in that term tends to convey an impression and so I will make this clear: The offender's father has no criminal history. I gather that what the offender is more concerned about is not that his father exposed him to criminality from a young age or was a poor role model to him as regards the committing of criminal offences, but simply that he was absent for significant periods of time.

27The offender is fortunate to have a partner who is capable of having such a positive influence on the offender's life. She will be of substantial assistance to him upon his release from custody as he seeks to put his life back on track. The offender also retains the support of other family members, including his father, who is in court today, his partner's mother and others as well. It is undeniable that others have suffered through the offender's misconduct as well as the victims of his offences and I will turn to the harm that the offender has caused to them in a little while. 

28The offender's partner is undergoing hardship, both financial and emotional, because of the absence of the offender. The offender's aunt, for whom the offender was a carer, also misses the offender's attentions and assistance but that hardship is in no way exceptional. It is regrettably commonplace when husbands and carers go to gaol for wrongdoing. I cannot take that hardship into account in deciding the appropriate sentence.

29I can, however, say that the offender will do his time in custody harder knowing that he is the sole person responsible for the predicament that he has put his loved ones in. It is also relevant of course to the prospects of the offender's rehabilitation. I cannot say that those prospects are good given the offender's drug addiction, but there are very positive signs. The offender is doing courses whilst in custody, although of course like all remand prisoners he experiences difficulty getting to those courses. And, particularly because of the birth of his son, the offender is engaged in a reassessment of the lifestyle he has been leading.

30I said I would return to the harm caused to the victims of these offences. It was serious. There is no up-to-date evidence as to Mr O'Neill's condition. I have to make an assessment on what I know as to the likelihood that he will experience ongoing consequences from the bashing he received at the hands and feet of the offender. I cannot say that that harm is out of the ordinary. The actual physical consequences for the victim of the aggravated robbery appear to have been limited, but I am sure that both Mr O'Neill and the victim of the aggravated robbery have experienced significant impacts from what the offender did to them. I am sure that their emotional wellbeing has been damaged as a result of the offender's crimes.

31It must be the case that the offender goes to gaol for a significant period of time, if only to reflect the objective gravity of what he did. General deterrence is of considerable importance in this case as well. People should be able to go to the shops or go fishing or stop at a pedestrian crossing without being the victims of serious crimes such as those committed by the offender. 

32There are special circumstances in this case. The offender, as I have said, is an impressive young man who has much to contribute upon his release from custody. He will benefit from assistance for an extended period. That is not done as a favour for the offender at all but simply represents a circumstance that if the offender can be assisted with rehabilitation and thus helped to avoid the commission of further offences the community as a whole benefits. 

33The sentences I impose are as follows:

34For the offence of demand money with menaces I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of six months commencing from 16 January 2013 and a head sentence of nine months. 

35Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, for the offence of aggravated robbery I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years, six months commencing from 16 March 2013 and a head sentence of three years, nine months. 

36For the offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of four years commencing from 16 September 2014 and a head sentence of seven years.

37For the offence of riding a motor vehicle whilst unlicensed under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the offender is convicted with no other penalty. 

38The overall effective sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of five years and eight months commencing from 16 January 2013 and a head sentence of eight years and eight months. The offender will become eligible to be released to parole on 15 September 2018.

2764078,Sabel v R; R v Sabel [2014] NSWCCA 101,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
The appellant was charged with four child pornography offences: two counts of accessing child pornography using a carriage service contrary to the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth), s 474.19(1)(a)(i) (counts 1 and 2), and two counts of possessing child pornography contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 91H(3) (counts 3 and 4). 
The appellant pleaded guilty to counts 1 and 2, and not guilty to counts 3 and 4. By way of defence to counts 3 and 4, the possession offences, the appellant argued that he had the material in his possession for a genuine scientific purpose and that his possession of the material was reasonable for that purpose: Crimes Act 1900, s 91H(4)(c) (now repealed). The appellant's case at trial was that he was a software developer, and that he had downloaded and possessed child pornography to research methods of monitoring or blocking transmission of child pornography over peer-to-peer file sharing networks. 
Puckeridge ADCJ found the appellant guilty of each of the possession offences. In respect of counts 2, 3 and 4, his Honour entered a conviction against the appellant and ordered him to enter into a good behaviour bond for 2 years. In respect of count 1, his Honour discharged the appellant without proceeding to a conviction pursuant to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 19B.  
The appellant appealed from his convictions in respect of each of the possession offences (counts 3 and 4), and sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed in respect of counts 2, 3 and 4. The crown also appealed against the sentence imposed in respect of count 1 pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5D.
The Court dismissed the appeals against conviction in respect of counts 3 and 4 and the appellant's appeals against sentence in respects of counts 2, 3 and 4. The Court upheld the Crown appeal against sentence in respect of count 1. 
By the Court:
In relation to the appeal from the convictions (counts 3 and 4): 
(1) For the purposes of s 91H(4)(c), a person would not be engaged in research, so as to have possession of material for a genuine scientific purpose, unless what was being done involved proper scientific method. The trial judge did not err in holding that the absence of any scientific method in the appellant's research, including his failure to make notes, prevented the defence under s 91H(4)(c) from being available to him. [103]
(2) Possession of child pornography material may be for a genuine scientific purpose even where the research undertaken is for the purpose of developing a commercial product. [98]
(3) Although the appellant was not required to approach authorities in order for the defence under s 91H(4)(c) to be available to him, his failure to do so was relevant to the reasonableness of his conduct. [109]
(4) The finding of a judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 133 has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury. Thus, an appeal against conviction shall be allowed if the court is of the opinion that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1). [138]-[139]
(5) Sufficient doubt had been cast upon the Crown's case that the child pornography was possessed for an erotic purpose: [174]. However, the defence of ""genuine scientific purpose"" under s 91H(4)(c) was not made out. The convictions should not be set aside on the grounds that they were unreasonable or not supported by the evidence. [176]
Considered: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63, 181 CLR 387; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53, 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400; R v Moffatt [2000] NSWCCA 174; 112 A Crim R 201; Keir v R [2007] NSWCCA 149; Hedges v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 263; FB v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 217.
In relation to the appellant's appeals against sentences (counts 2, 3 and 4):
(1) Notwithstanding that the trial judge accepted that the appellant had a genuine belief in the commercial prospects of his research, the appellant engaged in an activity known to him to be illegal. His conduct in accessing and possessing the material was criminal and serious. The trial judge did not err in entering a conviction in respect of counts 2, 3 and 4, rather than discharging the appellant without proceeding to a conviction under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 19B. [201]
(2) The trial judge was required not to take into account that the appellant may become a registrable person under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 when sentencing the appellant in respect of count 2. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 24A applies to federal offenders by operation of the Judiciary Act 1903, ss 68(1) or 79(1). [209]
(3) The fact that an offender suffers adverse social consequences when a conviction is recorded is not a relevant consideration in the sentencing process for child pornography offences. Any social embarrassment or consequence the appellant suffers is a direct result of his offending conduct. [211]
 Distinguished: Commissioner of Taxation v Baffsky [2001] NSWCCA 332; 122 A Crim R 568; R v Ingrassia (1997) 41 NSWLR 447.
In relation to the Crown's appeal against sentence (count 1):
(1) The sentencing judge was entitled to take into account the appellant's admission of having downloaded additional child pornography that was not the subject of a charge. The material is relevant to the appellant's character and antecedents, and also goes to the enquiry under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 19B as to whether the offence was ""trivial"" or committed under extenuating circumstances. When limited to these purposes, there is no breach of the principle that no one should be punished for an offence of which he or she has not been convicted. [227]-[229]
 Considered: Weininger v R [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629; The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383.
(2) The trial judge's sentencing discretion miscarried as his approach to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 19B was fundamentally flawed. There was no reference to the two-stage process of enquiry required by this section. [216], [230] 
 Considered: Commissioner of Taxation v Baffsky [2001] NSWCCA 332; R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29; Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140; 201 A Crim R 243.
(3) The trial judge did not give sufficient weight to the need for general deterrence. Accessing pornography creates a market for the material irrespective of the motives of the person accessing the material. [231]
(4) The sentence imposed was inadequate, and there was no warrant for the exercise of the residual discretion under the Criminal Appeal Act, s 5D, not to interfere even where the Crown has demonstrated error and a manifestly inadequate sentence has resulted. [232]
Considered: Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37; 302 ALR 192; Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462.





			Judgment
1THE COURT:  
Introduction
2The appellant, Ralph Warren Sabel, was charged with four child pornography offences, namely, two offences that he accessed child pornography using a carriage service, contrary to the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (the Code), s 474.19(1)(a)(i) (the access offences, being counts 1 and 2 on the indictment) and two offences that he possessed child pornography contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 91H(3) (the possession offences, being counts 3 and 4 on the indictment).  The charges were laid after police executed a search warrant at the appellant's home on 10 December 2008. 
3An offence contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Code carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  An offence contrary to s 91H(3) carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.  The appellant was also charged with possession of a small quantity of cannabis.
4The appellant pleaded guilty to the two access counts and to the cannabis charge.  He pleaded not guilty to the two possession counts but was found guilty of each by Puckeridge ADCJ in a judge alone trial pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 133.  
5There was no dispute at trial that the appellant had the material in his possession and that the material fell within the definition of ""child pornography"" in s 91H.  Rather, the appellant contended by way of defence that he had the material in his possession for a genuine scientific purpose and that his possession of the material was reasonable for that purpose:  s 91H(4)(c) of the Crimes Act (now repealed).  The Crown bore the onus of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that, having regard to the circumstances in which the material was produced, at the time that the appellant was in possession of the child pornography material, he was either not acting for a genuine scientific purpose or that his conduct was not reasonable for that purpose.  
6The appellant had also raised a defence under s 91H(4)(a) to the first possession count that he was not aware that he had the material in his possession.  That was rejected by the trial judge and is not in issue on the appeal.  A defence of scientific purpose pursuant to s 474.21(2)(d) of the Code was not available to the appellant in respect of the access charges as he did not have the written approval of the Minister to conduct research, as required by that section.  
7On 15 February 2012, Puckeridge ADCJ rejected the defence under s 91H(4)(c) that the appellant possessed the material with the intention of using the material for a scientific purpose and that such possession was reasonable.  His Honour found the appellant guilty of both possession offences.  
8On 3 July 2012, Puckeridge DCJ sentenced the appellant as follows: 
(1) Without proceeding to a conviction, his Honour discharged the appellant in respect of the first access count (count 1) pursuant to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 19B and ordered him to enter into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years. 
(2) The appellant was convicted of the second access offence and ordered to enter into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years pursuant to the Crimes Act, s 20 secured by a surety in the sum of $500.
(3) The appellant was convicted of the first possession offence (count 3) but, pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 9, the appellant was ordered to be released on entering into a $500 good behaviour bond for a period of 2 years.
(4) The appellant was convicted of the second possession offence (count 4), but, pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 9, the appellant was ordered to be released on a good behaviour bond for a period of 2 years.  
(5) The cannabis charge was dismissed pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 10.
9In sentencing the appellant, Puckeridge ADCJ rejected the Crown's submission that the appellant had an erotic interest in child pornography material.  It will be necessary to return to this issue when dealing with the appeal against sentence.
10His Honour also ordered that the laptop and the Western Digital hard drive be forfeited.
The appeal
11The appellant now appeals from his convictions in respect of each of the possession offences.  He also seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed in respect of the convictions for the possession offences and against the sentence imposed for the second access offence.  
12The Crown appeals pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5D against the sentence imposed in respect of the first access offence.  
13The Court will maintain the references to the Crown and to Mr Sabel as the appellant throughout these reasons.  
Issues on the conviction appeal 
14The appellant raised the following five grounds on the conviction appeal: 
(1) The trial judge erred in his interpretation of the defence under s 91H(4)(c);
(2) The trial judge erred by taking into account the appellant's failure to notify the authorities of his conduct;
(3) The trial judge erred in finding that the appellant did not need to download child pornography;
(4) The trial judge erred in finding that the Asset.dbf file included image or video files;
(5) The verdicts were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
15The issues raised on the sentence appeal are dealt with separately below. 
The legislation 
16The offence of possessing child pornography is provided for by s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act as follows:
""A person who has child pornography in his or her possession is guilty of an offence.""
17Section 91H(4)(c), as at the date of the offences, provided the following defence to an offence under s 91H(3):  
""[t]hat, having regard to the circumstances in which the material concerned was produced, used, or intended to be used, the defendant was acting for a genuine child protection, scientific, medical, legal, artistic or other public benefit purpose and the defendant's conduct was reasonable for that purpose.""
The case advanced at trial
18The first access offence (count 1) occurred on or about 21 November 2007 in the United States, when the appellant used an internet carriage service to access three digital video files comprising child pornography.  The appellant had downloaded the files onto his Sony laptop computer and, at the time of his arrest in December 2008, they were found in a subfolder on the laptop entitled ""HP Print Systems"".  This was the subject of the first possession charge (count 3).  In the trial, the files were referred to as ""WebCam"", ""Spycam"" and ""Tara"".  
19A further 269 images, which had been automatically created by the operating system, were also located on the laptop in a thumb cache.  A thumb cache is a repository record of parent files that have been deleted from a computer.  It is created automatically by a computer's operating system and is not accessible once the parent file has been deleted unless a user has the required viewing software.  The appellant was not charged in respect of those images.  He claimed that he did not know that the thumb cache images had been created. 
20The second access offence (count 2) and the second possession offence (count 4) occurred between 23 November 2008 and 11 December 2008 in Sydney, when the appellant used a carriage service to access 365 child pornography image and video files.  Copies of these files were located on a Western Digital external hard drive and were the subject of the second possession offence (count 4).  Both hard drives were found in a study in the garage of the appellant's Sydney home during a search of his premises in Sydney on 10 December 2008.
21The appellant's case at trial was that he had possession of the child pornography material the subject of counts 3 and 4 as part of his research directed to the development of a method to identify the transmission of child pornography over peer-to-peer file sharing networks and possibly to develop a means to monitor or block transmission of such material.  However, at the time that he was arrested, his research was still at a preliminary stage.  The appellant first raised this explanation in a recorded police interview made on 10 December 2012 (the ERISP). 
22The appellant identified his 'research' as comprising three stages.  The first stage occurred in November 2007 when he downloaded material onto his Sony laptop.  The second stage occurred in March 2008 when he used certain computer programs to gather further information.  The third stage occurred in November/December 2008 when he downloaded images onto the Western Digital hard drive.  The Western Digital hard drive had been named ""Idea Data"", which was the name of his company.
23The Crown case at trial was that the appellant had possession of the child pornography material for an erotic purpose and that he had an erotic interest in child pornography depicting underage girls, reflected in the nature of the majority of the images on the files the subject of the possession charges.  It was also part of the Crown case at trial that there were features of eMule that made it an ideal tool for the appellant to use to illegally download child pornography whilst minimising the risk of detection.  The Crown resisted any suggestion that the appellant possessed the material for genuine scientific purposes as being implausible, contradictory and inconsistent with the objective computer forensic evidence adduced in the Crown case.
Location and nature of the child pornography material 
24The evidence established that on 18 November 2007 at 1:47:51 pm AEST, the appellant downloaded onto a Sony laptop computer a free peer-to-peer software program called eMule.  By 2:13:08 pm, within half an hour of downloading the eMule program, the appellant entered the following search terms into the program:  ""PTHC special"", ""pthc"", ""fuck"", ""pthc cum"" and ""pthc jen"".  The evidence established that ""pthc"" was an abbreviation for ""pre-teen hard core"".
25On 21 November 2007 at 7:20:45 pm, 7:20:45 pm and 7:20:43 pm respectively, three child pornography videos:  (i) ""Spycam - 9undress p100(1).mpg"";  (ii) ""Tara 7yo girl-eat-cum-pthc.avi"";  and (iii) ""Webcam - likskooolgrl-0.avi"", were saved onto the Sony laptop computer.  The three files were saved in an obscure file-path entitled '000MYFILES\Program Data\Hewlett-Packard\HP Print Settings'.  These three files were the subject of the first access and the first possession charges.  There was no evidence before the court to indicate that the appellant had viewed the three videos after they were initially downloaded.  However, multiple copies of the three video files were found on the Western Digital hard drive.  As previously noted, a large number of thumb cache images files were also located on the Sony laptop.  
26An Asset.dbf file was also found on the Sony Laptop.  The Asset.dbf file was a database within a photo management software program called ACDSee, that allowed the user to catalogue photos on the computer.  The Crown witness, Federal Agent Kris Wilson, a member of the AFP Computer Forensic Team, gave evidence that the file was created on 8 November 2007 and was last accessed on 9 April 2008.  Mr Wilson was not able to open the file and it appeared that all the images had been deleted.  However, he found 12,529 file names.  
27Many of the file names on the Asset.dbf file suggested that the images were child pornography material.  An example given in oral evidence was ""!!!New Webcam Tied to Bed Pthc 7 YO Xkb.zip"".  Some of the file names corresponded with the three child pornography video files found on the Sony laptop.  Many of the files were JPEG image files and included such names as ""tara 7yr.jpg"" and ""pthc_ptsc jenny_9yo daughter swallowing cum, new.jpg"".  This file name was consistent with the search term ""pthc jen"" located by Mr Wilson in the eMule search strings file.  
28Other child pornography was located on the external hard drive.  The appellant had set up his computer so that eMule would download child pornography directly to a folder on the Western Digital hard drive that he had created for that purpose.  He agreed that he had done this to ensure that whenever he downloaded child pornography it did not end up on his laptop.
29In total, 381 child pornography files were found on the Western Digital hard drive.  Of these files, the evidence disclosed that 18 of the 381 files had a different 'last accessed' date from the date of creation, although it was not established that the appellant had viewed these files after they were downloaded.  The access date could have been an automated date created by the computer.  
30The file copies on the Western Digital hard drive were hidden in a complex structure of three file paths using what were described as ""anodnye"" numerical file names.  Two of the locations were associated with the use of the eMule program.  The file paths ran many layers deep, so that it was extremely difficult to read the contents of the hard drive and very difficult for a person unfamiliar with the structure of the file paths to find all copies of the three files.
31Most of the copies of the three video files on the Western Digital hard drive had the same MD5 hash number (described in the evidence as a fingerprint of a computer file) as the copies on the Sony laptop.  This meant that most, if not all, of the copies of the three files on the external hard drive were identical to the three files on the laptop.  The Crown contended that this demonstrated the appellant's erotic interest in child pornography.  The appellant's case was that, unbeknown to him, the three video files must have been copied across when he copied material from the laptop to the hard drive.  The Crown further contended that the appellant's erotic interest in child pornography was demonstrated by the fact that many of the files found on the Western Digital hard drive had names reflecting underage girls engaging in sexual acts with adults or in erotic poses.  
Appellant's statements in his ERISP 
32The appellant participated in a record of interview (ERISP) which commenced at the time of the execution of the search warrant on 10 December 2008.  When the appellant was informed by Federal Agent Randall of the subject matter of the search warrant the appellant's reaction was that if his wife knew, ""that would cause a divorce"" and ""that would completely destroy everything, everything"".  When it was suggested that his wife was ""going to find out eventually anyway"", he responded, ""[b]ut this will destroy my business.  It'll bankrupt me.  This is, this is really traumatic for me and I ----"". 
33When asked about these responses in his evidence in chief, the appellant explained his reaction was due to his experience a few years previously when he had been in a parlous financial position.  He said that when the police arrived and located the child pornography ""all I saw at that moment of time was a complete loss of ... financial credibility ... and a complete loss for my family and home"".  He said this was because he felt that there would be a ""misconception"" or ""misreading"" of his activities which would end up bankrupting his business. 
34However, earlier in his evidence, the appellant had said that he had discussed with his family on several occasions whether a product he had developed, NetFlow Auditor, could be used in finding paedophiles who were accessing child pornography online.  He said that he had first discussed this with his father in early 2007 and with his wife prior to going to the United States with her.  
35The appellant also said in his ERISP that he had only looked through the material once and that had been over the previous few nights.  The questions and his responses were as follows:
""Q52. But it is a pretty serious allegation that's been put to you.A It is but I, I am prepared to, to you know, front up and face, face the, the reality and I'm also prepared to, you know, I mean, this is not something that ah, this, this was, you know, I, I decided to go once to have a look.  I had a, I had a look through.
Q53. Yes.A And I just didn't expect this.
Q54. Okay.  When you said once, when was that?  Do you know the exact date?A Um, this was over the last couple of nights.
Q55. The last couple of nights you've had a look.A Yeah.
Q56. Okay.  What programs?  Are they video files?  Are they images?A Yes.  They are video files.
Q57. And what are they video files of?A Ah, some are of child pornography.  
Q58. Can you describe to me what a couple of the videos are?A Um, I think they might be some of the names that were here and I discovered them when I was downloading some other movies.
Q59. Okay.A And that's what I---
Q60. How did you find the - what were you downloading?A What was I downloading?
Q61. Yes, what movies?A I downloaded Times Masters, Star Gate, Atlantis.  I downloaded, I downloaded Star Wars and I think I came across them during one of the movies and I double clicked through, through into user and in the user there were all of these files and I thought I would have a look and I downloaded them and I, I had a look and I downloaded more the following night and I had a look and then I failed to delete them from my computer.
Q62. Okay.  When you say you downloaded more files, what were those files?A Those files were files - some were numbered, some were just, you know, may, may have had some names.  I haven't, I haven't barely got in and looked at all of the---
Q63. Were they child pornography files?A Yes.
Q64. Okay and what happened?  You've stored - you put them on to your hard drive?A Yes.
...
Q66. Okay.  What did you intend to do with those?A I was planning to look at them once more and, and, and I was planning to delete them.
Q67. Okay.  A I, I had, I had no intention of, of, of - I, I, I saw it once and I thought well this, this is, this is what the, everybody is, has been talking about in terms of what is child pornography and um, I had a look.  I had no desire to continue but I did look.  
Q68. Okay.A And I'm sorry for looking now.
...
Q74. How did you - yes.A I used a program called EMule.
Q75. EMule, and what type of program is that?A It's a peer to peer program.
Q76. Okay.  How long have you used that for?A I've used the peer to peer for a long time but I haven't downloaded anything else, I mean any - I, I've downloaded movies.
Q77. You've--A But I haven't downloaded any child pornography until the last couple of days.
Q78. Okay.  Did you look at pornography much on the internet?A Not at all.""  
36The appellant admitted in cross-examination that his answer to Q 54 was not completely correct and that the answer to Q 77 was incorrect.  His explanation in relation to Q 77 was:
""Q. You lied to him, didn't you, about where you downloaded child pornography?A. Yes I did.
Q. At question 77 you said, 'I haven't downloaded any child pornography until the last couple of days'?A. It was untrue.
Q. Because you believed, did you not at that stage, that at the very most that's what the police might be aware of?A. That's true.""  
37The appellant also admitted in cross-examination that he was only prepared to admit to police what he thought they were already knew;  that he had lied, when in Q 77 he said that he had not ""downloaded any child pornography until the last couple of days"";  and agreed that he ""wanted to admit to [the police] as little as [he] thought he could get away with"".
38The appellant said in the record of interview that he had only accessed eMule to download child pornography ""[o]ver the last three days"", whereas the ""Tara"" video had been accessed on 21 November 2008 and the file ""333333"" on 30 November 2008.  The appellant said later in his ERISP, at A 175:
""... [that was] very strange [unless] my dates had changed over that period but it hasn't been any period except for over the last, you know, five, five days or so ... since around [20-21 November 2008].""  
39The appellant explained to the police interviewer that his objective in ""looking up child pornography"" was for ""work purposes"".  He said that the work was ""not shared"" with his co-workers because it was illegal.  He repeated this in his evidence.  He said that he was trying to understand ""where the opportunity lay in forensic analysis of pornography, in particular, child pornography"".  He wanted to see if there was an opportunity to provide solutions ""into the universities and the ISPs"" (Internet Service Providers).  
40In his answer to Q 194, the appellant said that he had only engaged in downloading material on three or four occasions over the previous months, or since the middle of November 2008.  He said that he had only had a ""cursory and initial look"" to see if there was ""an opportunity or not"".  He said he did not retain the filenames and had deleted the recent material.  He continued: 
""[A194] ... once I'd gone and I was looking, I'd, I'd numbered the, the, the downloads to see how fast the downloads took. I took a, a group and I renamed them one.
I took a group, I renamed it two. A group, took a group, I renamed it three and then I was going to proceed in adding up the bytes to identify how much data could actually be downloaded over a particular  session. So that's the, that's the gist of my actions. I, I placed no encryption on it because I, I, I was not, I was not going to be keeping and retaining any of the files ...""  
41The appellant was also asked about looking at the pornographic materials:
""Q195 ... When we first came in when we had a discussion in the car, you said that you were planning to look at them once more and then delete them.A. Not look at them, look at the file sizes and ---
Q196: You said look at them.A, --- and look at the names and I don't mean look at the content. I, I have no desire to, to sit there looking through the content. The names are important to me. The key words are important to me, understanding what can be sniffed and what can't be sniffed.
Q197: You also said you 'had no desire to continue but I did look'.A. I looked at this and that's true because once, once they were - the, the email provides a list of files, some in download phase and some in completed phase. Those in the completed phase I doubled clicked on a, on a couple of files to, to see what the content was. When I saw the content, I don't, I, I, I didn't retain the, the, the, the, the media player open at all. I, I simply left it and progressed on with my other work and, you know, if you check on, on, on your dates and what other work that I was doing at the time, that would confirm that."" 
42He was then asked to explain how one of the files had been downloaded in November 2007.  His answer was as follows: 
""Q203. What can you tell me about that?A Because I do change the date on my computer, so I, I'm quite certain that anything in a, in a previous date would be most likely, because of the times, then change on my computer.
Q204. One year times stamp change.A Well, it's one year to the, the period um, and I, I do, I do admit I did look initially in my initial analysis of different peer to peer applications um, you know, probably a year ago but I, I never, I never retained anything and I, I did attempt to do some downloads but I don't believe that - I, I believe it was a generic download.  In this particular case ah, I, I came upon some key words during my, my searches of other software and I found as you go into the user you can say display what the user's files are and I displayed those, saw that they had some files that were, were, had particular keywords.  Um, I looked at those keywords.  I then progressed to search on those keywords on the, on the EMule.""  
43He explained that he had transferred the material onto the hard drive because he was concerned that his family and his children might be exposed to it.
The appellant's evidence explaining his research 
44The appellant was the managing director of an information technology company known as Idea Data.  In the course of carrying on that business, he had designed, developed and sold software capable of monitoring data moving across networks, including a program called NetFlow Auditor.  He had received awards from the Government recognising the developments he had made in security and business software.  
45In 2003/2004, the appellant had lodged a patent application in respect of a software program he had invented.  He said that this related:
""... generally to a method and apparatus for recording a transfer of data [that had] exclusive application to recording data transferred between electronic devices via a communication network"". 
46Gradually, business opportunities with various major Australian companies presented themselves.  The appellant also commenced to develop relationships with overseas technology companies that enabled the appellant to demonstrate his product in their trade shows.  However, his business was adversely affected by what he described as the 'tech-wreck', when there was a downturn in IT businesses generally.
47In 2007, the appellant travelled to the United States for a period of about six months, attending various trade shows and following up business leads.  He said that issues were arising at that time with the sharing of files, particularly in the music industry, including through the Napster network.  The appellant said that he started to research peer-to-peer technology such as eMule, which allows users worldwide to connect to computer servers hosted by the peer-to-peer programs and to share files they have stored on their own computers.  
48The appellant said that he was interested to know how fast a television program would come down on the peer-to-peer site, what the relevant technology was and whether it was causing ""pain"" to the television networks.  He also said that the eMule program was of particular interest as:
""... it offered an opportunity to change the program and users to create ... a crawler, so something that I could use to ... extract information out of the program itself.""    
49His ""driver"" at that time was to see whether his business could create a product that would identify the music downloaders and where that music was on the peer-to-peer networks.  He shelved that concept due to a lack of any commercial opportunities.
50In November 2007, the appellant downloaded eMule to see if he could pick up a science fiction television series called ""Stargate Atlantis"" he had been watching on cable television.  He said that he accidentally came across file names that suggested to him that the files might contain child pornography.  He said that there were hundreds of names that began with ""PTHC"", which he described as a naming convention, but said that he knew nothing about that naming convention at that stage.  He said that he first Googled these letters in March 2008.
51About half an hour later, using another computer, he entered the terms he had come across to ascertain what files with those names contained.  His explanation for using another computer was that his computer had crashed and he had purchased a new computer to which he transferred his data.  
52The particular terms the appellant entered at that time were:  ""PTHC"", ""PTHC special"", ""PTHC fuck"", ""PTHC cum"" and ""PTHC Jen"".  He said that he had made a mental note of these terms and searched them to identify more about that genre, although his initial evidence had been that he ""took down various key words out of the data"".  He said that he ""thought about it greatly before ... downloading [the files]"".  He said that when he entered the search terms thousands of results came up.  He denied in cross-examination that he had wanted to find examples of the genre because he was interested in looking at pornography involving children who were not yet teenagers.
53Having collected the file names that possibly indicated child abuse material, the appellant decided to download files with those names.  Over a period of about 12 days, he downloaded between 1,000 and 2,000 files which  he believed could contain child pornography.  These files were contained within about 5-10 archived files.  Archive files are computer files that contain other computer files.  The appellant discovered 5,000-10,000 computers that were prepared to share child pornography material.
54The appellant said that he was aware that the Australian Government and other governments had been trying to filter child pornography on the internet, but that having seen the amount of material distributed on peer-to-peer networks such as eMule, he came to the view that the existing approaches were completely misdirected as they focused on child pornography on websites.  The appellant, who described himself as being a person who had innovative ideas and who could ""create unique things and ... make a particular difference"", said his company had already developed software that was able to handle and store more internet traffic than other programs and collect a large amount of information at the core of peer-to-peer networks.  In particular, the program developed by his company was able to store information in a granular manner, which he explained meant storing ""the reference of every source, destination, internet address, and the related applications that they were being used for"".  
55The appellant said that it occurred to him that, using his existing knowledge, he might be able to develop a program that would monitor or filter out child abuse material.  He said that the notion he had at that time was to build a database of IP addresses containing child pornography and then:
""... bringing that back into a collector at the centre of an ISP to add and to automatically create a block list ... to filter that IP address serving its information to anybody else."" 
56His idea, or as he described it, his ""gut feel ... trying to understand what was coming down, trying to understand key words of that data and [his] attempts to build a keyword list"", became the first stage of what was described in the appellant's case as research directed to determining whether it was possible to develop a product to filter child pornography.  
57The appellant saved the three video files the subject of the first access count into the print directory, a sub-folder on the laptop.  It was accepted at trial that this was an obscure location in which to place the files.  He gave a number of explanations as to why he had done so, including that that file path happened to open at the time.  In essence, however, his explanation was that he had saved them in that location because he ""didn't want [them] right in his face in the desktop"".
58The appellant next downloaded a program called ACDSee, which is used to build thumbnail images of files.  The appellant explained that as the program goes into an archived file it builds a database of the file names within the archived file and it may also, in another database, generate thumb nail images of what is contained in the archived files.  The appellant said that his purpose in using the ACDSee program was to build a list of filenames out of the archives.  
59The appellant said that he then deleted the archived files from his laptop using a program called Eraser, because he ""didn't want the files"" or ""to even have access to that information"".  He said that he had not attempted to encrypt the data on his laptop because he thought he had deleted it.  The appellant said that at that time, he believed he was only creating a database of names and that he did not know that he was storing any images, as he had deleted any other related files.  However, the three video files saved in the print directory had not been erased and were still on the laptop when the police searched and seized his computers in December 2008.  
60The appellant's explanation for why those files had not been deleted was because he had probably forgotten that he had left them in an obscure directory.  The appellant also said that his children had access to his laptop and that he would not have knowingly left the child pornography videos on his laptop where his children might come across them.  Multiple copies of the three video files were located on the Western Digital hard drive, although the appellant said he was not aware that they had been copied across and that  this had apparently occurred automatically.  It should be noted that Mr Wilson gave evidence that the video files had only been accessed in 2007.  
61In response to the suggestion in cross-examination that he had downloaded the files to find out what was in them, he said that his purpose in doing so was to ""speed up the collection of file names"" so that he could build up a database of file names.  He said he needed an easy method of extracting names into a database format to ascertain what the key words of the genre were.  He also said his objective in downloading the files was to understand the nature of the particular community of users, how profuse the files were, the methodologies used to share the files, as well as the processes that he would need to go through in order to block or monitor the material.  
62When engaging in this first stage of 'research', the appellant did not adopt any particular method.  Nor did he make notes or keep records of his 'research'.  Rather, he claimed to have relied upon his own ""gut feel"" as to what he was dealing with and the making of mental notes.  This was so, notwithstanding his acceptance in cross-examination that it was critical to locating child pornography to have accurate search terms and MD5 hash numbers.  (A MD5 hash number is a random configuration of 32 letters and numbers that operates as an identifier of a particular file.)  In this regard, he agreed that it had become known to him that the MD5 hash numbers were essential to build an effective program such as he had in contemplation.  He also agreed that it was ""beyond most human capacity"" to recall an MD5 hash number, but that he had not kept a record of any of them.  
63The appellant had earlier said that his 'research' was at an early stage and that he ""was still mulling around"".  He said that this was his ""style of development"" and that even when developing his NetFlow Auditor, he had not ""made many notes"".  When tested in cross-examination on his failure to keep a note of search terms, he said that his research required ""a lot of prior experience in terms of understanding architecture and [that] recalling some of the search terms was relevant"".  He did not accept that the search terms were the ""heart and soul of this research"", but said it ""was the beginning of the research"".  He said that he had maintained and stored a database made by a program called ACDSee (which created the Asset.dbf file) which he retained underneath one of the application folders.  The appellant also agreed that ""to be effective"" his research required him to know ""for certain"" the history of each file, although he qualified his answer, saying he only needed to know the history of each file at the end of the research.
64This evidence was the essential aspect of the appellant's case in respect of the first stage of his research, namely, that he had had downloaded the files as part of his 'research', that he had deleted all other files he had downloaded at that time with a program called 'Eraser' and that he had overlooked that these files were on the computer, thus explaining why they remained in his possession.  He contended he did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that he was in possession of the material during the period between 21 November and 11 December 2007, being the period of possession alleged in the indictment.  As indicated, this aspect of his defence is not pursued on the appeal.
65The appellant said that he did nothing further until March 2008, as he was ""pretty shell shocked"" and felt he had ""to leave it alone for a while and just to mull it over in my head and think about what I'd learnt, and how it could be applied to technology"".  The trial judge accepted this evidence.  The appellant also said he had other work tasks to attend to.
66The appellant identified the second stage of his research as occurring in March 2008 when, in an attempt to advance his research, he conducted a series of tests relating to a repacked inspection method using programs called Wireshark and Colasoft Capsa, in conjunction with the eMule downloads.  The appellant said that he returned to his research at that time because there was discussion in the media about filters and he again thought that it was misdirected as it ignored peer-to-peer technology.
67The appellant explained that his purpose in using the Wireshark and Colasoft Capsa programs was to ascertain if child pornography could be identified as it traversed his network interface card.  He described this approach variously as ""using a sniffer approach"" or as involving ""deep packet inspection"".  He said Wireshark was not an easy tool and that Colasoft Capsa was easier to use, in the sense that if he:
""... plug[ged] in a string into a field and saying 'search PTHC.  If you see PTHC in the content, then [that] alert[s] me to the packets that contained that content'""  
68The appellant said he had limited success with this method and that there were aspects of it that he did not understand.  In particular, he did not understand the level of obfuscation or encryption that was occurring.  The appellant said that he purged all the material that he had downloaded at this time and all related back files and applications from the 'experiment' because the data had the potential to form actual images or videos of child pornography on the computer.  He said at this time he did not know whether the police had the capability to check MD5 hash numbers in the manner he was researching.  
69The appellant said that in about September/October 2008, there was again a peak in media coverage relating to filtering child pornography.  He said that as he had already ""put in the effort"", he ""needed to progress on some final thoughts and experiments relating to the MD5 signatures"", as well as considering ""how [he] would go about creating the active caller"".  He said that at this time he looked at a number of articles, to which he returned in about November 2008.  He had read those articles some years previously which, he accepted, did not relate to child pornography.  He said, however, that he drew on the knowledge within them when he was performing his research.  
70The articles were contained within a WIP folder on the desktop.  The folder had been created on 24 November 2008 the day prior to the first eMule download during this period of 'research'.  Mr Wilson, who had not located this folder at the time of his search, admitted that he had not entered the search term ""peer-to-peer"", but conceded that the folder contained files relevant to peer-to-peer detection research.  It should be noted, however, that the appellant conceded in cross-examination that none of the articles analysed how the particular content of a file might affect the flow of information over peer-to-peer networks, as opposed to the size of the file.  The appellant also agreed in cross-examination that one of the articles that he had pointed out as relating to file content was in fact about ""packet inspection"" which involved examination of digital information comprising part of the file but did not involve the opening of the file or looking at it to see what it depicted.
71One of the articles contained within the WIP folder was entitled ""Peer-to-Peer Behaviour Detection by TCP Flows Analysis"", by C Soldani of the University of Liège, published in the academic year 2003-2004.  He said that he understood from the Soldani paper the importance of keywords and trying to identify how to discover fingerprints of files as they crossed a network gateway.  
72Another article, ""Paedophile key words observed in eDonkey"", by Matthieu Lataby & Ors, had emphasised the importance of collecting key words from such data.  He said that that paper gave him an understanding that certain key words could be used to build a filter and there were other keywords that although relevant, were not as useful for that purpose.  The appellant accepted that the article related to the need to confirm the key words and that there was nothing in the article that suggested it was necessary to look at the material.  The appellant said, however, that the information in the article caused him to think that the kind of filter that was needed was one into which keywords were put into an active caller which would identify the MD5 hash number or signatures of a file.  He explained that he was interested in the MD5 signatures because they were ""the absolute fingerprint of a known file"".
73This was the genesis of the third stage of the research.  In essence, that stage involved four downloads of a total of 365 digital images using eMule (the second access and second possession counts).  The appellant downloaded the images late at night or in the early hours of the morning.  He said that he was awake at those times, but agreed that he did not need to communicate with anyone in the United States at that time.  
74The appellant said that the purpose in downloading the images was to observe the behaviour of the peer-to-peer connections on eMule as the number of downloaded files grew.  During this stage of the 'research', the appellant used a program called PacketTrap.  This program was not particularly successful for that purpose.  Indeed, he said that it produced less information than Wireshark and Colosoft Capsa, and he had difficulty installing and running it.  However, the appellant said that it allowed him to capture information about the physical IP addresses of the peers connecting to eMule in a much clearer way than the other tools and was closer in its functionality to the NetFlow Auditor program he had previously developed for other applications.  The appellant said this was important to him because ""if we were going to ... create an active caller to drive our software, then it would be a similar level of information"".  The appellant also installed an MD5 tool to assist in the process.  The appellant's evidence was that in this third phase of his research, he was interested in the electronic signature of the files.  
75Some of the files located on the Western Digital hard drive were part files stored in a directory marked T1.  In his evidence in chief, the appellant explained his purpose in having the part files, as follows:
""... the way that eMule works is that it has an incoming directory and it has a temporary directory.  One of the suppositions I had was that one could revolve the part files around and around and around in a circle and so by doing that in an active caller, be able to continually or to find the files that were in the temporary directory more frequently as the time of day passed which is why I called it T1.""  
76If the part files were clicked on, they produced an image.  However, the appellant said he did not look at the part files, but waited for them to complete.  The appellant said that he had used a program called WinRAR on the part files as a general extraction.  There were numerous other files found on the hard drive, including JPEG files.  The appellant said the JPEG files could have been produced as a result of using the WinRAR program.  The part files were contained in an archive and the JPEG files were contained within an inner archive.  The appellant said he looked at a ""few"" of the JPEG files.  He said he took a sampling out of that group and thought that there was a ""high propensity"" that the rest were also child pornography.  
77The appellant, in response to the question whether it was necessary to open every file for the purpose of the work he was doing, stated that he had installed MD5 tools and had checked that the subset of information related to child pornography, but he ""hadn't formed a method to start building the MD5 database"".
78The appellant also renamed the complete files he had downloaded using a numerical file name which, he said, he used as an electronic fingerprint because he had no desire to look at the names of the files at that stage.  He said that his objective in giving the files various anodyne file names was to segregate each of the sessions in which the downloads occurred to correspond with his periods of research.  The appellant said he did not rename the last download as the Federal police arrived at his premises the following morning, before he had time to do so. The appellant denied that his intention in renaming these file using numerical names was to camouflage his erotic interest in child pornography.  He maintained that he was renaming them for experimental purposes related to his research.  He also said that he had no desire to look at the actual file names, which caused him ""a fair bit of discomfort"".
79The appellant gave evidence that after his arrest he continued to work on his method but did so unconnected with child pornography.  In August 2009 he published an article titled ""Using Low auditor to assist in identifying Distributed Denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and other network behaviour anomalies"".  He said that this article was based on his findings on peer-to-peer networks from his three phases of work and that it presented a working method to assist in developing NetFlow Auditor to a stage capable of filtering out child pornography in the near future.
The trial judge's reasons on the defence of scientific research
80It is convenient to note at the outset that His Honour generally accepted the appellant as a person of credit, notwithstanding that he had admitted to lying to the police in his ERISP (referred to below).  His Honour considered that the lie went to the appellant's possession of the material and not to his defence.  But in any event, he considered that the credibility of the appellant was not relevant to the determination of the question whether the Crown had established that there was no reasonable possibility that the appellant produced, used or intended to use the three video files for a genuine scientific or other public purpose.  
81It is also convenient to note that the Crown had sought to rely on the presence of the copies of the video files on the hard drive, the thumb cache images and the data indicating the content of the files in the Asset.dbf file as tendency and/or coincidence evidence to establish that the appellant possessed the three video files for an erotic purpose.  His Honour rejected the Crown's applications.  It appears that as part of the consideration of the Crown's tendency and coincidence evidence applications, the appellant sought a direction that the purpose of the Asset.dbf file was to create a database without images or video files.  His Honour noted in that regard that the file located by Mr Wilson in fact did contain images or video files.  This observation is the subject of ground 4 of the appeal.
82A further matter that needs to be noted is his Honour's finding that the appellant's main concern in possessing the three child pornography video files ""was to utilise the technology which he had developed for commercial use and for his own benefit"".  As his Honour observed:
""... the evidence of the [appellant] is quite specific in that regard.  He stated that he was not making any notes about anything to do with research at the time other than mental notes.""  
83His Honour accepted that the appellant did not access the three video files other than at the time that he first downloaded them.  His Honour also accepted the appellant's evidence as being truthful, that having downloaded the three videos, he felt he had to ""leave it for a while and mull over it in his head and think about what he had learnt and how he could apply it to technology"".  However, his Honour concluded that the appellant did not intend to use the three video files for research.  Rather, the appellant's intention was to use the data from the three videos for the purposes of his research.  That being so, his Honour concluded that it was not reasonable that the three video files remained on the computer.  It followed, in his Honour's view, that the Crown had discharged its onus in relation to the first possession charge in showing that there no reasonable possibility that the accused produced, used or intended to use the three video files for genuine scientific research.  In coming to that conclusion, his Honour took into account the appellant's good character when assessing the likelihood of having committed the offence.  
84His Honour then dealt with count 4, relating to the appellant's possession of two groups of files.  One group was the 365 image files located on the Western Digital hard drive, being files and part files produced by eMule.  The second group consisted of the multiple copies of the video files originally located on the laptop.  The charge in count 4 involved possession of the material downloaded during what the appellant described as the third stage of his research. 
85His Honour's reasons for rejecting the appellant's defence under s 91H(4) in respect of the second possession charge (count 4) were similar to those given for rejecting the first possession charge.  He accepted that the appellant was concerned with creating a business opportunity by adapting software that he had developed to filter out certain material on the peer-to-peer networks.  His Honour accepted the appellant's evidence that he had referred to a number of articles during each phase of his 'research'.  His Honour accepted that these articles were relevant to peer-to-peer behaviour and internet traffic analysis and were relevant to his attempts to adapt the software he was developing for the commercial purpose he had in mind.  His Honour then posed the question whether the appellant's possession of the material the subject of count 4 was for a genuine scientific purpose, having regard to the circumstances in which the material was used or intended to be used, and whether his conduct was reasonable for that purpose.  His Honour determined both aspects of this question in the negative.
86In doing so, his Honour had regard to the dictionary definitions of ""genuine"" and ""scientific"".  He found that ""genuine"" meant ""properly so-called"" and ""scientific"" meant ""according to rules laid down in exact science for performing observations and testing the soundness of conclusions"":  see the Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary.  His Honour found that the appellant's possession of the material was not for a genuine scientific purpose for the following reasons.  First, there was no method involved in the 'research' undertaken by the appellant.  The appellant was not acting in accordance with any rules laid down by science.  For example, he made no notes, contending that ""he was thinking and [made] notes in his own mind"".  Secondly, the appellant was aware that possessing the material was illegal.  Thirdly, the appellant made no official approach to any law enforcement agency in respect of the prospective development of a filtering program.  He had made a cursory inquiry only to ascertain if law enforcement officers were interested in any filtering method.   
87His Honour referred to the submission of the Crown that PacketTrap (a program the appellant said he used in conjunction with eMule in the third phase of his research) could not be used to analyse the content of child pornography material on the internet.  The appellant had not challenged that evidence, but contended that his purpose in using that program was to obtain information about all of the point to point IP connections.  In this regard, it was relevant that the appellant's case was that he had developed a method to monitor and filter out child pornography on the Internet as opposed to having developed a working product that would achieve that result.  However, it was his intention to adapt software that he had already developed to do that.  
88His Honour concluded that there was no necessity for the appellant ""to have regard to the child pornography for the purposes that he intended"" and rejected that the appellant's conduct was reasonable for the purpose he had in mind.  His Honour made the observation that a commercial purpose did not exclude the possibility of a scientific purpose but reiterated that at this time the appellant was only making mental notes whilst carrying out his analysis.  In his Honour's view, the only rational inference was that the appellant did not possess the material for a genuine scientific or other public benefit purpose, notwithstanding that he accepted the appellant was a genuinely innovative person, anxious to develop his own software.
89Important to his Honour's determination was the appellant's evidence that it was not necessary that he download child pornography material for the development of a software product that would filter out pornographic material.  The appellant challenges this finding as not being supported by the evidence (see ground 3).  
Ground 1:  the trial judge erred in his interpretation of the defence under s 92H(4)(c)
90Section 91H(4)(c) provides a defence in circumstances where the person was acting for a genuine scientific purpose.  The appellant contended that the trial judge's interpretation of the adjective ""scientific"" in s 91H(4)(c) was unduly narrow and failed to reflect the broader context of scientific purpose in the section provided.  In particular, the appellant contended that his Honour's interpretation of the provision imposed a requirement of ""scientific method"" which was not required by the legislation.  The appellant also argued that a person could be acting for a genuine scientific purpose within s 91H(4)(c), even if the steps taken for that purpose were of a preliminary nature.
91Accordingly, the appellant submitted that his Honour erred by placing emphasis upon the absence of any scientific method in the ""research"" the appellant claimed he was undertaking, that is, that he had not acted according to a set of rules laid down in exact science and had not made notes.  The appellant submitted that a person could engage in genuine scientific research without engaging in any form of scientific method, as his Honour appeared to consider was necessary.  He further submitted that a broad construction of ""scientific purpose"" was consistent with the objects of the section which was to prohibit the possession of child pornography except for limited purposes and, relevantly to this case, for a genuine scientific purpose.  
92The appellant also pointed out that reliance upon dictionary definitions can be of limited utility:  see House of Peace Pty Ltd v Bankstown City Council [2000] NSWCA 44; 48 NSWLR 498 at 505 and that, in any event, his Honour erred in too narrowly confining the meaning of ""scientific ... purpose"" in s 91H(4)(c) by referring to a portion only of the dictionary definition of ""scientific"" and then from one dictionary only, namely, the Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary.  The complete entry in that dictionary is as follows:
""Scientific -adj.  
1a. (of an investigation etc) according to rules laid down in exact science for performing observations and testing the soundness of conclusions. 
b.  Systematic, accurate.
2.  Used in, engaged in, or relating to (esp natural) science (scientific discoveries, scientific terminology).  
3.  Assisted by expert knowledge.""  
93The appellant submitted that a person could be engaged in genuine scientific research without taking notes and without performing an experiment according to the rules laid down in exact science.  In this regard, the appellant relied upon his evidence as to how he had developed applications in the past and had undertaken research without note taking, namely, by ""learning about the technology, learning about the data, by getting a good gut feel of the data and progressing forward in the next step"".  The appellant explained that this was how he got his ""flashes of genius"".
94The Crown emphasised the necessity for the purported scientific purpose to be genuine and that an analysis of what the appellant did demonstrated his assertion to be spurious.  The Crown submitted that the appellant's case, that he was engaged in scientific research consistent with a scientific purpose, was simply implausible and that his evidence was false and inconsistent.  We will return to the bases upon which the Crown supported its submission shortly.  Before doing so, however, it is necessary to consider the terms of the statutory defence and the challenge that is now made by the appellant to his Honour's approach to it. 
95The defence under s 91H(4)(c) is made out where, relevantly:
""... having regard to the circumstances in which the material concerned was produced, used or intended to be used, the defendant was acting for a genuine ... scientific ... purpose and the defendant's conduct was reasonable for that purpose.""
96The appellant's case at trial was that, having stumbled across search terms that contained terms that indicated to him that child abuse material might be involved, it occurred to him that he could possibly develop a commercial product that would permit such material to be filtered and blocked.  To that end, he said he engaged in research and that his possession of the material was part of, or for the purpose of, that research.  
97Although his Honour referred to the appellant 'producing' the three video files on his computer when they were stored in the obscure directory path, the appellant did not in any real sense 'produce' the child pornography in those files.  For that reason, we do not consider that part of the defence under s 91H(4)(c) is available to him.  Rather, the appellant accessed child pornography, downloaded it, saved it (and was thus in possession of it) and subjected it to a number of computer programs.  In that way, he ""used"" the material as comprehended by the defence under the section.  It was his case that he did so as part of the very early testing of an idea that he might be able to develop into a commercial product.  To that extent, he claimed that he also intended to use the material for research.  It was in that context that the nature of his 'research' was relevant to the determination of whether the Crown had excluded the defence.
98It should be noted immediately that s 91H(4)(c) does not speak in terms of research, nor, as the appellant pointed out, was there any express requirement that a person apply or utilise a scientific method if using or intending to use the material for a genuine scientific purpose.  We accept that it is possible that the research into and development of a commercial product could involve ""producing, using or intending to use child pornography material for a genuine scientific purpose"".  His Honour accepted that possibility.  On that premise, it was appropriate for his Honour to consider whether the activities undertaken by the appellant had the attributes of genuine research to ascertain whether a commercial product could be produced.  
99His Honour, by reference to a dictionary meaning of ""scientific"", found that it did not.  As already stated, the appellant has complained that his Honour's reliance on a specific dictionary meaning of the term ""scientific"" was too narrow.  However, even if the complete definition of ""scientific"" is considered, the appellant's activities could not be described as ""systematic or accurate"".  There had been no systematic logging or recording of search terms and their MD5 hash numbers, both being tasks essential to what the appellant said he was trying to do as a first step in his research.  
100Subject to one matter to which we will turn, the same conclusion is reached when consideration is given to the meaning of 'research', which was the activity in which the appellant contended he was engaged.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary, research means:
""1. The act of searching carefully for or pursuing a specified thing.;
2. systematic investigation or inquiry aimed at contributing to knowledge of a theory topic etc by careful consideration, observation or study of a subject;  investigation undertaken in order to obtain material for a book, article or thesis etc; the product of systematic investigation.""  
101There was nothing systematic about what the appellant did in the course of any phase of his 'research'.  We are satisfied that what the appellant did could neither be described as scientific nor readily described as research in the dictionary definitions where emphasis is given to systematic investigation and careful observation or study.  However, the appellant's evidence was that he was pursuing a particular end, namely, seeking to ascertain whether he could develop or adapt technology that would act as a filter for child pornography material.  
102The appellant's use of the Wireshark and Colasoft Capsa programs in March 2008 and PacketTrap in November/December 2008 provide some support for this claim as none of these programs actually gave him access to the child pornography material as distinct from other information or data in the download files.  The appellant's possession of the material could thus be said to be for the purpose of an investigation or 'pursuing a specified thing'.  In other words, it could be said that he had possession of the material by way of a preliminary investigation to ascertain whether it was worth proceeding with the attempted development of a commercial product.  
103The real question, therefore, is whether, at the preliminary stage of his investigation, could be said to be engaged in research, such that his possession of the material was for a ""genuine scientific purpose""?  Although the Court has not found this question easy to resolve, we have come to the conclusion that the trial judge was correct to conclude that for the purposes of s 91H(4)(c), a person would not be engaged in the research stage of a project, so as to have possession of material for a genuine scientific purpose, unless what was being done involved proper scientific method.  
104We are further of the view that the appellant's possession of the material on either the Sony laptop (the first possession charge) or on the Western Digital hard drive (the second possession charge) was not reasonable for any genuine scientific purpose.  The possession charge in respect of the three video files found on the Sony laptop was in respect of the period 23 November 2007-10 December 2008.  Even on the appellant's case, he did not have possession of those files on that computer during that period for a genuine scientific purpose.  Rather, he was in possession of the material for that period because he did not realise the video files had not been erased and/or had forgotten that they were located in the obscure print directory.  
105Even if the appellant's initial possession had been for a scientific purpose, a proposition that the Court rejects, there was no evidence to support a case that the continued possession of the videos was reasonable for that purpose.  On the appellant's own case, he had not intended to conduct any further research on or relating to those files so that his continued possession was not reasonable for a genuine scientific purpose.  The fact he forgot that the files remained on his laptop may be relevant to sentence, but that is a distinct and different question.  Further, for the reasons given at [*125], we consider that the possession of the files on the Western Digital hard drive was not reasonable for genuine scientific purposes.  
106Having come to that conclusion, it not necessary to deal with the specific arguments raised by the Crown in relation to this ground of appeal.  Those arguments are better dealt with in relation to ground 5, namely, that the guilty verdicts were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. 
Ground 2:  the trial judge erred by taking into account the appellant's failure to notify the authorities of his conduct 
107The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in taking into account the appellant's failure to notify authorities as a factor relevant to the reasonableness of his conduct in possessing the pornographic material.  The appellant contended that his Honour took this fact into account as a determinative factor, notwithstanding that his Honour recognised that there was no obligation upon the appellant to do so.  
108The appellant's failure to make an official approach to authorities was one of three reasons that his Honour gave for rejecting the appellant's defence and so was an important factor in his Honour's reasoning.  The question, therefore, is whether it was an error for his Honour to have regard to that matter. 
109In the opinion of the Court, his Honour did not err as alleged.  His Honour understood there was no requirement upon the appellant to make any such enquiries.  However, as the evidence emerged in this case, the fact that the appellant had not made formal enquiries of authorities in relation to his proposed commercial product, particularly in an area as serious and sensitive as the possession of child pornography, which, as the appellant knew, was illegal, was relevant to but not determinative of the question whether it was reasonable to have the material in his possession for his purported scientific purpose.  A person who had possession of such material for a genuine scientific purpose might have been expected to have made enquiries of relevant authorities to ascertain whether the development of a commercial product would be of interest to them, or what their requirements might be in relation to any such product.  
110It might also be of interest to a person proposing to develop a product to ascertain from the authorities whether there was already research in the field and, if so, what the nature and extent of that research was, as it would be pointless to replicate existing research.  Additionally, an enterprising IT product developer might decide to build on such research.  In other words, it would seem unusual for a person embarking upon the development of a new product not to seek to ascertain whether any proposed product would interest the authorities to whom it was likely to be marketed. 
111We would reject this ground of appeal.  
Ground 3:  the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant did not need to download child pornography
112A factor the trial judge considered relevant to whether the defence of genuine scientific purpose had been excluded by the Crown was what his Honour stated to be the appellant's ""agreement"" that it was unnecessary for that purpose to download the child pornography material.  His Honour also stated that there was no necessity for the appellant to view child pornography for his alleged purpose of scientific research.  
113The appellant submitted that he had not agreed that it was unnecessary for him to download child pornography.  He further submitted that his Honour's finding that there was no necessity to have regard to the child pornography was contrary to the evidence. 
114The appellant relied upon the following evidence given in his evidence in chief:
""Q.  At that point in time you saw the child pornography. What did you think that you could do?A. Well, initially, I didn't know how big a problem it was. I'd tried downloading Stargate and I'd tried downloading top ten hits and I'd - I'd had a feel for - for what that profile of traffic was so it was purely, at that stage, just an understanding of, you know, what is - what is child pornography and I - I progressed to - to download a couple of files at that stage to - to analyse if - if this was - if the names were - that were indicative of the - or the key words that I'd seen in my initial browse were, in fact, child pornography. (Trial Tr 308)
...
Q. If I can sort of take you back and ask this question. Do you recall the first time you downloaded a child pornography material, and what the purpose was of that download?A. The purpose was simply a research purpose, and to qualify that it even was child pornography.
Q. Why did you need to know whether it was child pornography or not?A. No point in stamping around in the dark if it - if you, you know, if it's not. Then its perhaps not - there's actually a couple of reasons. Firstly, files can be polluted and its difficult to know whether that data is in fact pornography or not pornography until you download.
Q. Is it possible to have done the type of research that you were attempting to do without actually downloading child pornography.A. I don't believe so.""  (emphasis added) 
115The appellant explained that it was only ""when you start clicking on, and commencing a download [that] you get any idea ... of the community that is serving up the files"".
116The appellant was cross-examined about the purpose of downloading the child pornography material as follows:
""Q. But you certainly don't dispute that firstly when you downloaded all of the files on pages 1 to 6 that you intended to download child pornography?A. I intended to download child pornography for the purpose of my experiment, yes."" 
117The appellant referred to other evidence he gave, including that the eMule program was rich in observable statistical data, including how many files were being shared, the size of files and how long it took for those files to come down.  The appellant contended that the depth of his understanding of the processes he was observing was consistent with the fact that he was conducting scientific research.  His contention was, as submitted on the appeal, that ""he needed child pornography ... to understand what was happening"".
118In cross-examination, the appellant agreed that the position at the conclusion of the 'first stage' of his 'research', was that he had a number of files of child pornography downloaded on his computer, but disagreed that that was the net effect of his research.  Rather, he said he was left with a great deal of knowledge of the nature of child pornography on peer-to-peer networks.  He conceded that the knowledge he obtained was that there were a lot of people using peer-to-peer networks to obtain access to child pornography, but qualified that concession in terms that it was ""one observation"" he had made.  He added that that observation was a driver for continuing to identify and build a method to block access to child pornography.  
119The Crown contended that his Honour's recording of the appellant's concession and his finding that it was unnecessary to have regard to the child pornography was open on the evidence adduced by the Crown and on the appellant's own evidence.  The Crown pointed to the evidence of Mr Boag and Mr Wilson as being relevant to this issue.  
120Mr Boag was the Managing Director of an IT company.  His duties mostly involved sales and support of the company's software.  He was not cross-examined on his report.  The PacketTrap program, which the appellant was using in December 2008, being the third stage of his 'research', was one of the company's products.  Mr Boag explained that that program allowed users to monitor traffic flow volume on the application level only.  No information could be obtained by the use of this program regarding the content of a file.  Nor could that program be used to analyse the content that was transmitted on peer-to-peer networks.  
121The appellant accepted the correctness of this evidence and in fact relied upon his own evidence that he had limited success using the PacketTrap program.  He explained, however, that in using the program he was trying to ascertain the number of peers of the physical IP addresses.
122Mr Wilson also gave evidence on this point.  He read the papers and articles tendered by the appellant.  These articles were directed to types of files in the context of peer-to-peer networks, but did not specifically discuss content.  In particular, he said that none of the articles concerned child pornography, nor did they analyse how the content of a file might affect the flow of information over peer-to-peer networks.  The articles were concerned only with an examination of the size of a particular file.  The appellant had accepted that to be the case in cross-examination, in that the one paper that he had referred to as relating to file content was, in fact, about ""a packet inspection"", which involved examination of digital information (numbers and letters) comprising part of the file, but did not involve a person opening the file and watching it or looking at it to ascertain what it depicted. 
123The Crown also relied upon the fact that the appellant's contention, that he had used the programs Wireshark and Colasoft Capsa as part of his scientific research, was undermined by his concession that neither program enabled a particular file to be identified as one depicting a picture of a child being abused by an adult.  
124The appellant argued that this evidence did not entail the concession for which the Crown contended because, as he explained in his evidence, although the two programs referred to did not enable the content of the file to be depicted, they enabled information from a file which had been identified by its MD5 signature, to be collected and matched against a known list of files.  In other words, the information obtained from the use of those programs gave the user the capacity to infer information as to what was being worked towards, in this case, the detection of child pornography.  
125The essential point, however, on the Crown argument, was that there was no need to retain the child pornography for the purposes of research.  Rather, the names of the files and the MD5 hash numbers were the relevant research tools, not the child pornography material itself.  There is some support for this submission in the appellant's own evidence, in that he thought he had erased all files downloaded in November 2007.  If he had intended to erase the files, there was no need to retain them.  Thus, whilst the appellant did not make the direct concession attributed to him by his Honour, it could be thought that the concession is implied in this evidence.
126However, we consider that his Honour's finding was directed to what he thought was an express concession by the appellant that there was no need to download the child pornography for the purposes of his research.  There was no such express concession.  The Court has concluded, therefore, that this ground of appeal has been made out.  
127That in itself would not be sufficient for the appellant to succeed on the appeal, if in fact it was established that there was no need to download child pornography or to retain the material for the research purposes he contended he was pursuing, or alternatively, it was not reasonable for him to do so.  As this consideration more readily arises under ground 5, it is convenient to consider it further when considering that ground. 
Ground 4:  the trial judge erred in finding that the Asset.dbf file included image or video files
128The appellant's evidence was that he created an Asset.dbf file using a program called ACDSee, as he wanted to build a list of file names out of the archives into a database format.  He said that, in his understanding, he was not storing any images.
129The trial judge referred to this file when ruling on the Crown's application relating to tendency and coincidence evidence.  His Honour rejected those applications.  In doing so, he observed that the appellant's evidence was that the purpose of the file was to create a database without images or video files.  His Honour then added, ""it is further noted that the file located by Mr Wilson in fact did contain images or video files"".
130The appellant contended that this finding was erroneous, as Mr Wilson's evidence was to the contrary.  The Crown did not concede that the trial judge erred as alleged.  It is thus necessary to look at the evidence in the context in which it was given. 
131Mr Wilson was cross-examined about the Asset.dbf file.  He agreed that the program had collected a wealth of data beyond the video and image files.  He agreed ""absolutely"" that of the 12,529 files contained within the Asset.dbf file, not all would be indicative of child pornography and that whilst a file name might suggest child pornography, that could not be verified unless the file was opened.  He agreed that the original files from which the data in the Asset.dbf files had been collected had probably been deleted from the computer, so that he had not been able to look at the original files and could not and did not say that the Asset.dbf files contained video or image files.  He also agreed that it was not possible to determine whether the items in the database file were created when the computer was first turned on.  Importantly, he agreed that it was not possible to know whether the programme had operated over one or two days or continuously.  
132The appellant is correct in his submission that Mr Wilson did not give the evidence recorded by the trial judge.  Having said that, it is possible that the judgment reflects a typographical error, with the word ""not"" having been omitted before the words ""contain images or video files"".  The possibility of typographical error makes his Honour's observation read more naturally and is consistent with his findings on the sentence hearing. 
133If his Honour in fact made the finding as recorded in the judgment, the appellant contended it was significant, in that his case was that he had used the Asset.dbf file to create a database of filenames and additional data such as file size, but had deleted the parent image files and parent video files.  On his case, the retention of this data, as opposed to the video or image files, was inconsistent with an erotic interest in child pornography and consistent with scientific research.  He submitted that the failure of the trial judge to understand this must have had a significant and erroneous impact upon his Honour's assessment of whether the Crown had established that there was no possibility that the material was possessed for a genuine scientific purpose. 
134The Crown submitted that his Honour's statement subject of this ground of appeal could be read as a statement that the Asset.dbf file contained a database of the names of video and image files that were apparently files the contents of which could be inferred to be child pornography.  On that reading, the Crown submitted there was no error.  We do not accept this submission.  Although we consider that his Honour's judgment may possibly contain a typographical error, what is suggested by the Crown involves inferring that his Honour meant to make a complex finding itself based upon inferences that might be drawn from the evidence.  We do not consider that is a proper or available reading of his Honour's words.
135The Crown further submitted that if there was the error as alleged, it was not significant as his Honour had only had regard to the evidence in the course of determining the Crown's application that such evidence be treated as tendency or coincidence evidence.  Having rejected those applications, his Honour did not further take it into account in determining the guilt of the appellant on the possession charges.  
136For the reasons we have given, we consider that even on the appellant's case, his research was at such a preliminary stage that his possession of the material could not be considered to constitute genuine scientific research.  Further, the appellant did not suggest in his case that, when he returned to his research in late 2008, he was proposing to build on or otherwise utilise the file names he had catalogued in the Asset.dbf file.  
137It follows from what we have said that his Honour either made the error alleged in this ground of appeal, so that the ground should be treated as having been made out, or alternatively that his Honour's observation should be treated as containing a typographical error.  If his Honour made an erroneous finding in relation to the file, it would not have been of any significance as the appellant did not give any evidence of the intended ongoing use of the information stored in the files.  
Ground 5:  the verdicts were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence 
138As the Court has noted, the appellant was tried by a judge alone.  The Criminal Procedure Act, s 133 provides that a judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person.  Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.
139The Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1), provides, relevantly, that an appeal against conviction is to be allowed if the court is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  
140The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 6(1) is, as stated in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.""  (citation omitted)
141In MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated, at [58], that the reference to ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" in M was the equivalent of the statutory test in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act that the verdict is ""unreasonable"" or ""cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"".  
142Their Honours noted that for the purposes of s 6(1), the starting point was that the jury had the primary function in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused.  It was integral to that proposition that the jury had seen and heard the witnesses.  However, as had been stated in M by the majority, at 494:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
143Earlier in M, at 492, their Honours had said:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"" (citations omitted).
144In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400, French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ reiterated, at [14], that:
""In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make 'an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality'"" (citations omitted).
145In R v Moffatt [2000] NSWCCA 174; 112 A Crim R 201 at [3]-[4], Wood CJ at CL (Foster AJA and Adams J agreeing) stated the principles that apply where there is an appeal from a verdict given by a judge sitting alone as follows: 
""The Court of Criminal Appeal is a court of error, and does not proceed by way of rehearing in a way that permits it to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the jury, or of the trial judge where acting alone: Kyriakou  (1987) 29 A Crim R 50, and Kurtic  (1996) 85 A Crim R 57.
Where, as in the present case, the relevant ground is that the verdict, or more accurately the finding on the question of guilt by the trial judge (s 17, Criminal Procedure Act 1986  (NSW)) should be set aside upon the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence (s 6(1), Criminal Appeal Act 1912  (NSW)), then it can only intervene if, after making its own independent assessment of the evidence, it concludes that it was not open for the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant: M (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; 76 A Crim R 213 at 216, and Jones  (1997) 98 A Crim R 107. In that event error permitting the substitution of a verdict of acquittal is established: Coombe (1997) 93 A Crim R 81 at 87-88.""
146This statement of principle has been consistently applied by this Court:  see Keir v R [2007] NSWCCA 149 and authorities cited therein;  Hedges v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 263 per Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) at [46];  FB v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 217 per Whealy JA at [113].  
147In Hedges, Beazley JA further said:
""47 In Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 the High Court observed, at [26] 262, that the first limb of s 6(1) must be seen through the prism of the Criminal Procedure Act, s 33(1). The Court continued: 'The first limb will address attention to the evidence upon which the trial judge acted, or upon which it was open to the trial judge to act, in reaching the finding as to ultimate guilt. Approached on that footing [the question is] is that finding 'unreasonable' or one which 'cannot be supported'?'
48 The High Court considered it unnecessary to determine whether in cases under the first limb on an appeal from a judge alone an appellate court will only intervene, relevantly, where there was no evidence to support a particular finding, or the evidence was all one way. See also Keir v R [2007] NSWCCA 149 ; Arun v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 214. That is not the case here. I consider that the Court should approach the matter by asking the question whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was not open to the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant.""
148This Court must, therefore, apply the principles stated in M in its determination as to whether the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
149In accordance with the principles in M, it has been necessary to consider all of the evidence, essential aspects of which have been discussed in the preceding paragraphs of these reasons.  Other evidence is considered below.  Before turning to consider that evidence, it should be noted that, as there was no dispute that the appellant had child pornography in his possession, the question whether the verdict was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence essentially centres around the defence raised under s 91H(4)(c).   
150The Court's rejection of ground 1 means that is it is difficult for there to be a basis upon which ground 5 can succeed.  Nonetheless, it is necessary to consider the submissions advanced by the parties, should our conclusion on ground 1 be wrong, or should the submissions in respect of this ground raise different considerations that either require that conclusion to be revisited or, alternatively, which reinforce that conclusion.  
151Ground 5 also has to be considered having regard to the onus on the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not have the material in his possession for a genuine scientific purpose, or that his possession was not reasonable for that purpose.  The gravamen of the Crown case was that the appellant's possession of the material was for an erotic purpose.  
152Whilst it is not an element of the offence that child pornography material be possessed for an erotic purpose, it was the Crown case that this was the appellant's purpose.  On the basis that an erotic purpose was inconsistent with a genuine scientific purpose, the Crown's position was that if it established that the appellant's possession was for an erotic purpose, it would have established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not have the protection of the defence under s 91H(4)(c).  There was no suggestion in this case that the two purposes could or did co-exist.
153The Crown submitted that the contemporaneity of downloading the eMule program and entering the search terms in November 2007 supported the inference that the appellant's purpose in doing so was to locate child pornography material on the network and to download it.  The Crown submitted that the search terms entered by the appellant were consistent with his having an erotic interest in child pornography depicting underage girls and inconsistent with a genuine scientific purpose.
154The Crown also contended that the location of the files within the obscure print settings indicated that the appellant had deliberately hidden the three video files downloaded onto the Sony laptop and was consistent with his knowledge that the files contained child pornography, with his knowledge that it was illegal to possess the files and with his desire to avoid another user of his computer accessing the files, rather than having them for any genuine scientific purpose.  The Crown also argued that the lack of any method in the downloading and cataloguing of the files was inconsistent with the asserted scientific purpose and that his continued possession of the material files was unnecessary for such purpose.  
155The Crown further contended that the making of multiple copies on the Western Digital hard drive, their hidden location in a complex structure of file paths on the hard drive and the fact that the file structure was consistent with the appellant having ""backed up"" multiple copies of the material, indicated his interest in their pornographic content rather than any interest in the data for research purposes.  
156The Crown submitted that the creation of the Asset.dbf database in November 2007 at the first stage of the 'research' indicated a tendency to possess and access large quantities of child pornography material, reflecting an interest in such material unconnected with any legitimate research purpose.  Many of the names in the 12,529 image files in the Asset.dbf file were consistent with the appellant being a prolific downloader of child pornography with a special interest in depictions of underage girls.  The Crown submitted that the use of the ACDSee photo management software gave rise to an inference that the appellant had used the software to catalogue some or all of the images he had downloaded.  
157Likewise, the Crown submitted that the names and content of the child pornography files found on the Western Digital hard drive demonstrated the appellant's interest in child pornography depicting underage girls.  The anodyne numerical file names given to many of the files, and their location on a separate hard drive that the appellant used specifically for this material, was also said by the Crown to give rise to an inference that the appellant had intended to conceal the child pornography material from others because he knew it was illegal to possess it and because he was deeply ashamed should anyone know that he had an erotic interest in such offensive material.  In support of this argument, the Crown pointed to the appellant's answer in his ERISP that: ""I'm really concerned about this because I really didn't want anything to break up our family"".  However, it must also be noted that in the record of interview the appellant also stated that his objective in downloading child pornography ""was a positive outcome for the business"".
158In summary, the Crown's case that the appellant possessed the material was only because of his erotic interest in it, was supported by the following matters which rendered his defence implausible:  (i) the manner in which the files were stored was not consistent with any method by which scientific research might be undertaken;  (ii) the files were 'hidden' on the computer in the sense that the appellant had filed them in obscure computer files where they would not ordinarily be expected to be found;  (iii) the names of files had been anonymised so as not to be easily identified;  (iv) the appellant knew that his activity was illegal so that it was unlikely he would have risked detection if he was undertaking research;  (v) the failure to inform authorities, when he knew his conduct was illegal which further undermined any likelihood that he was engaging in research;  (vi) the failure to inform his work colleagues that he was engaging in research for a commercial product and his engaging in activities late at night in his garage, both of which also undermined any suggestion he was engaging in research.  
159The Crown also relied upon the fact that the appellant had lied in respect of a number of matters relating to the possession of the material, had given contradictory evidence, and that particular parts of his evidence were simply implausible and ought not be believed.  The evidence relating to these matters has, for the most part, already been considered.  For example, the lies the appellant told in his ERISP have already been referred to and standing on their own, and without condoning them, might be thought to be understandable.  However, it is necessary to give further consideration to some of the contradictory evidence and the aspects of the appellant's evidence said to be implausible.  The lies may be seen differently in the context of the totality of the evidence.  
160The contradictory evidence related mainly to his evidence as to why he saved the three video files subject of the first possession charge to the obscure HP Print Settings directory on the Sony laptop.  The appellant gave a number of explanations as to why he saved the video files in the print directory.  He said that his initial reaction had been to put the video files in an obscure directory and that he had thereafter forgotten about that directory.  
161His explanation of his initial reaction was that he was ""scared of the nature of the content ... I had print settings open, I copy pasted the path and I put it into the incoming directory of the email"".  He expressly denied that he had looked at some of the files because he enjoyed looking at the material.  Later, he said that he had purchased a printer when he was in the United States and that:
""... as I was progressing forward with my research I just arbitrarily took that particular directory.  It was kind of distant from myself and I placed them there."" 
162The asserted inconsistency in this evidence was that the appellant had said that he set eMule to store files in the print settings directory first.  If that were so, it would support the Crown case that his conduct did not relate to any research purpose, but that he had intentionally used the eMule program in November 2007 for the purposes of accessing child pornography which he then saved.  However, the appellant, on being specifically questioned on this, denied that he had set eMule to store files in the print settings directory before he came across the child pornography.  It cannot therefore be said that, when regard is had to the whole of the evidence on this topic, there was the inconsistency asserted by the Crown. 
163Another matter upon which the Crown relied was the asserted inconsistency in the appellant's conduct in purging many of the files but retaining others.  The appellant's explanation was that he had retained certain files so that there was a record of the MD5 hash number, which would enhance the capacity for peers to join his computer.  He also said that he retained the files to ascertain if he could identify or find any other further identifiers.  He said:
""I was looking at the time it took to download and retain - at least there were various sessions where the files were downloaded after a period of time and it was how quickly did those particular files land up in that particular experiment.""  
164The appellant said that this was an experiment to watch the peer growth over the period of the three or four sessions he had conducted.  He said maintaining a record of the MD5 hash number would provide him with more peers connecting to his computer.  When it was suggested to him in cross-examination that, in contradiction to that, he had deleted other child pornography files, he replied ""[t]hat was certainly the case in March [2008]"".  
165Some of the files located on the Western Digital hard drive were part files only, being the result of partial downloads.  The appellant agreed that the effect of a partial download would be to cause a file to have a different MD5 hash number from that of the complete file from which the part file was created.  The Crown contended, therefore, that given the importance of the MD5 hash number to the appellant's research, there was no point in maintaining part files on the computer, being another indication that the appellant had possession of the material for an erotic purpose.  The appellant responded that the creation of the part files occurred during the downloading process and was an automated aspect of the eMule application.  He also said that the MD5 hash number was maintained within other areas of the application and that once the part file populates all of its pieces it became that file's fingerprint.  There was no evidence that contradicted this evidence. 
166There were, however, some inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence.  Thus, although the appellant agreed that he looked at the files, his evidence differed slightly, in that he first said that he looked briefly at the files to confirm that they were child pornography and that he saw adults and children in a state of undress.  However, he agreed that he had earlier said in his evidence that he had clicked through the files and ""there would have appeared to be some abuse"".
167The appellant had also admitted that he had given false answers to the police in the course of his record of interview.  In particular, he agreed that his answer to the police that he had looked at the material once was not true, nor was he providing a complete picture to the police by saying that he had only downloaded child pornography over the couple of nights prior to his arrest.  The appellant also agreed that he only told police what he thought they already knew.  It must also be said that the appellant never explained why he had kept the three video files at all.  
168The Crown also submitted that the appellant's evidence that, having downloaded and saved the files, he had forgotten about them was transparently false.  However, his Honour found the appellant to be a credible witness.  We consider that in determining whether the Court accept that assessment, the principles stated in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 apply, at least by way of guidance if not directly.  
169The Crown has not pointed to any incontrovertible evidence, nor has the Court found any, that would establish that his Honour's assessment was flawed.  Nor has it demonstrated that the trial judge misused his advantage in some way.  Nor could it be said, subject to one aspect of the case to which we will come, that the appellant's evidence was glaringly improbable or contrary to compelling inferences.  Rather, the Crown asks that the appellant's evidence not be accepted and that the Court draw inferences from the evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant did not possess the material for a genuine scientific purpose but for an erotic purpose.  
170There are two aspects of the evidence in particular that point to the appellant having an erotic interest in the child pornography, namely, there being 12,529 file names on the Sony laptop and the retention of the 365 images on the Western Digital hard drive.  Although the appellant was not charged in respect of the thumb caches on the laptop, the only conclusion that can be drawn from this evidence was that it involved a significant quantity of downloaded material.  Given that at this stage of his research the appellant said he was only interested in ascertaining what the search terms he entered would produce, it is implausible that he needed to download that quantity of material.  
171The retention of the 365 images on the Western Digital hard drive bears the same implausibility.  If the appellant was concerned to understand how fast and how much material would download, the lack of notation of the results is inexplicable.  The retention of the material would not have assisted him to advance that aspect of the research.  Having said that, the Court accepts that downloading the material was probably necessary if the appellant's evidence as to research is accepted.  
172The Crown also relied upon an experiment the appellant undertook about a week before the trial, which the Crown contended demonstrated that the appellant's evidence as to how he accidentally came across the child pornography was implausible.  It will be recalled that the appellant claimed that he had inadvertently stumbled across child pornography when using the eMule program to find copies of a television series.  A week prior to the trial he undertook the same task he had undertaken in November 2007, downloading 47 pages of eMule screen shots on a screen similar to that used at the time of the downloads in November 2007.  However, the appellant did not find any reference to terms that indicated child pornography or otherwise stumble across child pornography.  
173The Court accepts that this was useful evidence in the Crown case.  However, we do not consider it would be safe to rely upon a single experiment to conclude that the appellant lied about how he came across the material in the first place.  There could be explanations as to why no child pornography came up on that single occasion.  There was no evidence that the vagaries of peer-to-peer networks were such that what the appellant said happened could never happen.  No repeat experiments were undertaken to demonstrate the statistical unlikelihood of what the appellant said had occurred.  
174There was other evidence that cast doubt upon the appellant's case or which was unsatisfactory.  The appellant's case that the Eraser program did not pick up the three video files might be thought to be doubtful.  But the Crown did not establish that that could not have happened.  Likewise, the appellant's evidence that the three video files must have been copied over when he copied over everything from his laptop to the Western Digital hard drive was unconvincing, but not disproved by the Crown.  However, the one matter that the Court could not dispel, on reading the evidence, is that the appellant may have had the material for some proposed technological development.  Whilst not having the same degree of conviction on this as the trial judge, it is sufficient to cast doubt on the Crown case that there was no such purpose.   
175Two aspects of the appellant's account were consistent with his ""playing with"" or ""mulling over"" such a possibility.  The first was the appellant's stated reaction to what he had come across and the nature of the activities undertaken in March 2008.  Child pornography, put starkly, is horrific.  The trial judge, who viewed the child pornography material, stated the three video files found on the Sony laptop were ""particularly abhorrent"".  The appellant said that that was his reaction to it and was one of the reasons he put it aside and did not come back to 'advancing' any research until March 2008.  Secondly, the programs he used in March 2008 were directed at volume, not content and the appellant did not retain any child pornography on that occasion.  
176However, the further consideration we have given to the evidence under this ground has not persuaded us that our conclusion on ground 1 is wrong.  For that reason, ground 5 is rejected and the appeal on conviction should be dismissed. 
The sentence appeals 
177The appellant raised the following three grounds of appeal on the sentence appeals:
(1) That given the objective findings in relation to the offences and the subjective circumstances of the appellant, the trial judge erred in imposing a conviction in relation to counts 2, 3 and 4.  
(2) The trial judge erred in failing to take into account the impact that the offender has or may become a registrable person under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the consequences of being convicted under the Commission for Children and Young People Act 1998 in relation to the sentence imposed for count 2. 
(3) The trial judge erred by finding that the appellant did not need to download child pornography as part of his research.
178The Crown appealed against the sentence imposed for the first access offence on the basis of manifest inadequacy.
Ground 1
179As the Crown submitted, this ground, although not framed as such, is in essence a complaint that the sentences which involved convictions on each of the three counts and the imposition of good behaviour bonds were manifestly excessive.  The maximum penalty for the access count was 10 years and 5 years for the possession counts.
The trial judge's findings
180The trial judge made the following findings as to the objective circumstances of the appellant's offending in respect of count 2 (the second access count) to which the appellant had entered a plea of guilty. 
181First, his Honour held that he could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had accessed the child pornography material for an erotic purpose.  The child pornography consisted of the 381 digital image files and multiple copies of the three video files accessed between 23 November 2008 and 11 December 2008 and located on the external hard drive.  His Honour accepted the appellant's evidence that he had forgotten about the three video files on the Sony laptop and that they had been saved on to the Western Digital hard drive when a broader collection of work files were backed up.  Specifically, his Honour accepted that there was a reasonable possibility that the appellant had no specific intent to save multiple copies of those three files on the hard drive. 
182His Honour further stated that he took into account the appellant's evidence that the hard drive was used as a storage device for data obtained in the course of his 'research' to understand the operation of peer-to-peer technology.  The Court understands that his Honour accepted the appellant's evidence on this matter.  His Honour also took into account the appellant's evidence that he had renamed the files to anodyne numerical filenames as he had no desire to look at the names of the files at that stage of his research.  His Honour further took into account that the files were not possessed for further sale or distribution so he would not profit from any sale of the files.
183His Honour also noted that the evidence before him was that the appellant's motivation in accessing the files was to stop the trade in child pornography.  His Honour noted that the files on the hard drive were password protected and the appellant had provided the password to the Australian Federal Police.
184His Honour had earlier, in giving reasons for the sentence imposed in respect of count 1 (the first access count the subject of the Crown appeal), referred to the appellant's subjective circumstances, namely, that he was 47 as at the date of sentence, that he was married with two children and that he had no previous criminal convictions.  His Honour considered those matters to be relevant to sentence, notwithstanding the Crown's submission that such personal circumstances were common in offences of this nature.
185His Honour also took into account the matters raised in the report of Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist.  Dr Nielssen had commented upon the appellant's use of cannabis for its antihistamine effect on his sinus condition.  Dr Nielssen had expressed the view that the use of cannabis would have caused the appellant to experience a period of ""elevated mind"" associated with an increased propensity to act on impulse when taking cannabis, and an impaired recognition of both the correct procedure to follow and the possible consequences of his actions in accessing material that he knew to be illegal.
186Dr Nielssen had also referred to a possible diagnosis of a bipolar disorder.  This possible diagnosis was based upon a history of:
""... two periods of hypomania triggered by medication known to have mood altering effects and the corroborative information provided by his wife.""  
187Dr Nielssen also noted a history of the appellant having periods of abnormal energy and enthusiasm in the course of developing his programs which Dr Nielssen considered were consistent with periods of ""subclinical elevated mood"".
188His Honour also took into account that the appellant had pleaded guilty to the offence.
189In relation to count  3, the first possession charge unsuccessfully defended at the trial, his Honour expressly found that the appellant was not in possession of the three video files between 17 December 2007 and 11 December 2008 for erotic purposes.  
190His Honour rejected the Crown submission that the creation of the thumb cache on the Sony laptop was the act of a collector of child pornography for erotic purposes from which it could be inferred his possession of the three video files were for the same purpose.  His Honour accepted that the thumb cache was automatically created by the computer's operating system.  He further accepted the appellant's evidence that the images in the thumb cache were not accessible to the user without specific software and, more particularly, that such software was not stored on the computer.   
191Likewise, his Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the presence of the Asset.dbf file and its contents were consistent with the appellant being a prolific downloader of child pornography with a special interest in images depicting underage girls.  His Honour accepted the appellant's submission that if he had a special interest in underaged children, it would be expected that the images in the Asset.dbf file would have been retained.  His Honour considered that the fact the appellant had deleted the images, but retained the database, substantially undermined the Crown's submission that the appellant possessed the material for an erotic purpose.
192In considering the purpose for which the appellant possessed the material, his Honour took into account that there was no evidence that it was downloaded using web browsers or via email but, as reflected in his finding on count 1 (the first access count), he downloaded the files whilst browsing through eMule and chancing upon file names that appeared to him to relate to child abuse material.  His Honour also noted that the appellant's evidence that he had downloaded the material for the purposes of creating a database.  
193His Honour concluded that on the evidence, it was reasonably possible that the appellant had created the database to keep a record of the names and files he had downloaded.  His Honour observed that whilst he had not been satisfied that the appellant possessed the child pornography material for genuine scientific research, he was satisfied that he was retaining records in the database for the purpose of analysing the operation of peer-to-peer network systems for a commercial purpose.  In this regard, his Honour observed that the appellant was certainly acting alone and not in a collaborative network of like-minded persons.
194His Honour referred to the fact that the appellant had admitted that he had looked at child pornography images but had only looked at a couple for a short period of a few seconds.  
195In dealing with count 4 (the second possession charge), although defended unsuccessfully at trial, his Honour relied upon the various matters to which he had referred in considering the previous counts.  His Honour reiterated that the appellant was a person of good character and, in the opinion of Dr Nielssen, had good prospects of rehabilitation.  Dr Nielssen's opinion was based upon the absence of any history of significant substance abuse, any pattern of other forms of antisocial conduct and the appellant's strong community ties.  Dr Nielssen had also expressed the view that the appellant was at low risk of further offending.  His Honour, who was sentencing the appellant approximately three and a half years after the last offence, considered that Dr Nielssen's opinion would appear to have been well based.
The appellant's submissions on sentence
196The appellant submitted that the compelling findings made in his favour and, in particular, his Honour's acceptance that he had no erotic purpose in accessing or possessing the material the subject of counts 2, 3 and 4 and that his ultimate objective was to produce a product to prevent access to child pornography, should have attracted the operation of s 19B(1)(d) of the Crimes Act (Cth).
197The appellant was particularly critical of the sentence imposed in respect of count 3, contending that his Honour lost sight of the fact that the charge related only to three video files which had not been accessed since the date of their download in November 2007.  The Court does not accept this submission.  His Honour expressly noted that the prosecution did not rely upon the contents of the thumb cache on the laptop as part of the material the subject of that offence.  Rather, the Crown had relied upon the material as evidencing an erotic purpose in the appellant's possession of the material, a submission which his Honour rejected  
198The appellant also complained that there was a ""curious reference"" to the material being downloaded via email.  The Court accepts that whilst this was an erroneous remark, there was reference in the evidence to an email in respect of the downloading of the material in November 2007:  see [*41] above.  Notwithstanding this error, we do not consider that it impacted in any way upon the sentencing process.
199The appellant next contended that the effect of his Honour's finding that the defence under s 91H(4)(c) was not made out was because his Honour had concluded that there was no reasonable possibility that the appellant's conduct in possessing the three video files was for a genuine scientific purpose, objectively considered, and, further, it was not reasonable that they remained in an obscure directory on the computer.  It was submitted that where his Honour was nevertheless satisfied that the appellant had a genuine belief in the commercial prospects of his analysis, the gravity of the offending was extremely low.  The appellant also submitted that if his evidence that he had forgotten about the files were accepted, his continued possession of the files could only have been due to recklessness and not to a specific intent to view child pornography on an ongoing basis.  
200The appellant submitted, therefore, taking into account his good character and his subjective circumstances, the circumstances of this offence were such that, although finding the offences proved, his Honour should not have proceeded to record a conviction under s 19B.
201We reject this submission.  Both in accessing and possessing child pornography, the appellant engaged in activity known by him to be illegal.  Whilst we have accepted on the appellant's evidence the reasonable possibility that he saw a need to download the material, we do not accept that there was any necessity for him to save the material for any legitimate commercial or other purpose.  Even if the appellant's possession of the files thereafter was reckless, because there is a reasonable possibility he had forgotten they had been saved, his conduct in saving the files in the first place was criminal and serious.  While that conduct is of course the specific conduct the subject of the first access offence the subject of the Crown appeal, the interaction between the accessing and possessing of the material in counts 1 and 3 is unmistakable.  We consider that the appellant's subjective circumstances and his Honour's acceptance that the appellant had a commercial purpose in downloading the material and had not retained the files in his possession for an erotic purpose, was appropriately reflected in the good behaviour bond imposed by his Honour on count 3.
202In relation to count 4 (the second possession offence of which he was found guilty after trial), the appellant contended that the trial judge's error in finding that it was not necessary to download child pornography in order for the appellant to undertake his research was relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of that offence.  The Court has dealt with this issue in relation to ground 3 on the conviction appeal.  As we have indicated, there is a likelihood the statement in his Honour's reasons was a typographical error.  In any event, it is not evident that his Honour took that matter into account on sentence.  The only point at which he possibly did so was in his reference that the circumstances giving rise to count 4 occurred as part of the third stage of the appellant's research.  Nor is there anything to indicate that his Honour considered this to be an aggravating factor in the commission of the offence.  Had he done so, it would be expected that there would have been reference to it in his Honour's remarks.
203The remarks we have made in the preceding paragraph are also sufficient to dispose of ground 3 of the sentence appeal, save for one additional matter pursued by the appellant in support of that ground. 
204The appellant also submitted the fact that of the 398 files subject of count 4, only 18 had been accessed after they had been created in the folders also indicated that the appellant's offending in respect of count 4 was ""still at the lowest end of the scale"".  In conjunction with all of the objective and subjective factors to be taken into account, the appellant submits that the offence should have been dealt with under s 19B. 
205For the reasons we have given in respect of counts 2 and 3, the Court rejects this submission.
Ground 2
206The appellant complained that in sentencing him in respect of count 2, his Honour should have but failed to have regard to the fact that his conviction may have constituted extra-curial punishment because of the possibility that he may become a registrable person under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act:  see R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260; 154 A Crim R 268 at [21], or because he may become the subject of an order under the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004.
207The appellant referred the Court to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 24A, which provides:
""24A Mandatory requirements for supervision and other prohibitions to be disregarded in sentencing
(1) In sentencing an offender, the court must not take into account, as a mitigating factor in sentencing, the fact that the offender: 
(a) has or may become a registrable person under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 as a consequence of the offence ...""
208The appellant pointed out that as count 2 was a Commonwealth offence, s 24A did not apply.  It followed that his Honour should have had regard to these possibilities. 
209The premise that s 24A did not apply was erroneous and so it is not necessary to consider the appellant's submissions advanced in support of his ground.  Section 24A applies to Federal offenders pursuant to the operation of the Judiciary Act 1903:  see s 68(1) or s 79(1).  Accordingly, his Honour was required not to take these matters into account.  
Ground 3
210We have already referred above, at [*], to ground 3.  The appellant made a further submission in support of ground 3, namely, that the fact an offender suffers adverse consequences when a conviction is recorded, including legal and social consequences, is a relevant consideration in the sentencing process:  Commissioner of Taxation v Baffsky [2001] NSWCCA 332; 122 A Crim R 568 at [38];  R v Ingrassia (1997) 41 NSWLR 447 at 449.
211We have already rejected ground 2, in which it was contended that the appellant may suffer adverse legal consequences as a result of his conviction.  To the extent that the appellant's further submission relates to adverse social consequences, we are of the opinion that even if the remarks made in the authorities to which we have referred continue to be good law in the context of fraud and tax evasion, they do not apply in relation to the offences under consideration here.  Any social embarrassment or consequence that the appellant may suffer from being convicted of accessing and possessing child pornography is a direct result of his offending conduct, the underlying nature of which is exploitative of children.  The Crown submission in this regard is particularly relevant, namely, that the appellant could have engaged in his primary research, particularly that involving packet inspection software, using files with legal content, including adult pornography.
212It follows that the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.
Crown appeal on sentence:  manifest inadequacy
213His Honour published separate reasons for sentence on count 1, as the first access offence of the two access offences to which the appellant entered pleas of guilty.  It was the only offence dealt with under the Crimes Act (Cth), s 19B(1)(d).  The sentencing reasons on that count preceded his Honour's sentencing reasons for counts 2, 3 and 4 by ten days for reasons that are of no present importance.  
214Section 19B of the Crimes Act (Cth) provides:
""19B Discharge of offenders without proceeding to conviction
(1) Where:
(a) a person is charged before a court with a federal offence or federal offences; and
(b) the court is satisfied, in respect of that charge or more than one of those charges, that the charge is proved, but is of the opinion, having regard to:
(i)  the character, antecedents, age, health or mental condition of the person;
(ii)  the extent (if any) to which the offence is of a trivial nature; or
(iii)  the extent (if any) to which the offence was committed under extenuating circumstances;
that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment, or to inflict any punishment other than a nominal punishment, or that it is expedient to release the offender on probation;
the court may, by order:
(c) dismiss the charge or charges in respect of which the court is so satisfied; or
(d) discharge the person, without proceeding to conviction in respect of any charge referred to in paragraph (c), upon his or her giving security, with or without sureties, by recognizance or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court, that he or she will comply with the following conditions:
(i)  that he or she will be of good behaviour for such period, not exceeding 3 years, as the court specifies in the order;
(ii)  that he or she will make such reparation or restitution, or pay such compensation, in respect of the offence or offences concerned (if any), or pay such costs in respect of his or her prosecution for the offence or offences concerned (if any), as the court specifies in the order (being reparation, restitution, compensation or costs that the court is empowered to require the person to make or pay):
(A)  on or before a date specified in the order; or
(B)  in the case of reparation or restitution by way of money payment or in the case of the payment of compensation or an amount of costs-by specified instalments as provided in the order; and
(iii)  that he or she will, during a period, not exceeding 2 years, that is specified in the order in accordance with subparagraph (i), comply with such other conditions (if any) as the court thinks fit to specify in the order, which conditions may include the condition that the person will, during the period so specified, be subject to the supervision of a probation officer appointed in accordance with the order and obey all reasonable directions of a probation officer so appointed.""
215One of the questions that arises on the Crown appeal is whether the precondition to the exercise of the power to discharge the appellant without proceeding to conviction under s 19B(1)(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) was satisfied such as to allow for the positive finding that it was ""inexpedient"" to impose a punishment on the appellant for accessing child pornography other than the nominal punishment of requiring him to enter into a good behaviour bond.  
216In the remarks on sentence there is no reference at all to the operation of the section.  The two stage process of enquiry requires was discussed by this Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Baffsky.  Those considerations are as follows:  
""(a) Section 19B(1)(b) itself consists of two stages.  The first is the identification of a factor or factors of the character specified in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and/or (iii) of the paragraph.  The second stage is the determination that, having regard to the factor or factors so identified, it is 'inexpedient to inflict any punishment' or to reach the other conclusions provided for in the paragraph;
(b) Section 16A(2) of the Crimes Act identifies the matters that must be taken into account in exercising the second stage of the discretion in s 19B;
(c) The application of s 19B to revenue offences does not require 'exceptional circumstances' to be established.  The statute formulates a test of whether punishment is 'inexpedient'.  That is the test to apply;
(d) The significance of the conduct regulated by the statute which creates the offence is a consideration to which a sentencing judge must have regard in deciding whether it is 'inexpedient' to impose punishment in a particular care;  and
(e) General deterrence remains a relevant principle for sentencing Commonwealth offenders and it is appropriate to take such matters into account in determining whether to exercise the discretion under s 19B.""  (citations omitted)  
217When we dealt with the appellant's challenge to the sentence imposed on count 3 (the first possession offence charged), we noted that the three video files the subject of count 1 were accessed on 21 November (the date of charge) after the appellant downloaded them whilst browsing eMule to better understand the technology involved in peer-to-peer networks.  While his Honour was satisfied that the appellant chanced upon file names suggestive of child abuse material, he was also satisfied that the appellant deliberately downloaded the particular video files knowing it was illegal, a matter his Honour regarded as of significance when considering the objective seriousness of an offence attracting a maximum penalty of 10 years.  His Honour did accept, however, the reasonable possibility that the files had not been accessed after they were downloaded, notwithstanding that they were retained in the appellant's possession thereafter.  His Honour also found that the content of the three video files was ""particularly"" abhorrent which was relevant to his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending.
218The Crown submitted that this Court, in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 stated there were four factors to be taken into account when assessing the seriousness of the offence of importing child pornography, as follows: 
""(a) The nature and content of the material including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed (the degree of its depravity);
(b) The volume of pornographic material imported or accessed or possessed;
(c) Whether the material was intended by the offender for personal use or for distribution to others;  and
(d) Whether the offender will benefit from the offence.""  (Crown further subs (36))
219The range of factors relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the transmission and dissemination of child pornography under the Criminal Code (together with possession offences both under the Criminal Code and under the Crimes Act) have recently been the subject of both restatement, elaboration and refinement in Minehan v R [2010] NSWCCA 140; 201 A Crim R 243.  At [94], R A Hulme J enumerated a non-exhaustive list of factors of significance as follows:
""1. Whether actual children were used in the creation of the material.
2. The nature and content of the material, including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed.
3. The extent of any cruelty or physical harm occasioned to the children that may be discernible from the material.
4. The number of images or items of material - in a case of possession, the significance lying more in the number of different children depicted.
5.  n a case of possession, the offender's purpose, whether for his/her own use or for sale or dissemination. In this regard, care is needed to avoid any infringement of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 
6. In a case of dissemination/transmission, the number of persons to whom the material was disseminated/transmitted.
7. Whether any payment or other material benefit (including the exchange of child pornographic material) was made, provided or received for the acquisition or dissemination/transmission.
8. The proximity of the offender's activities to those responsible for bringing the material into existence.
9. The degree of planning, organisation or sophistication employed by the offender in acquiring, storing, disseminating or transmitting the material.
10. Whether the offender acted alone or in a collaborative network of like-minded persons.
11. Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by vulnerable persons, particularly children.
12. Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by persons susceptible to act in the manner described or depicted.
13. Any other matter in s 21A(2) or (3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (for State offences) or s 16A Crimes Act 1914 (for Commonwealth offences) bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offence.""
220Counsel for the appellant referred his Honour to Minehan as he did in his written submissions in response to the Crown appeal.  Although his Honour makes no reference to the decision, his sentencing reasons reflect that consideration was given to at least some of the enumerated factors in the judgment, including (10), (11) and (12).  In addition, as the appellant emphasised, in respect of factors (4) and (5), there were only three video files accessed and his Honour was satisfied that the appellant's purpose in accessing them was not self-gratification of an erotic interest in underage girls but in the first stirring of an interest in developing software to frustrate the internet trade in child pornography.
221The Crown submitted that in the sentence for the first access offence, his Honour had allowed the absence of an erotic purpose (or proof of it to the standard in this case) to overwhelm proper consideration of the need for general deterrence.  The Crown further submitted that in affording the appellant the benefit of having no conviction recorded under s 19B(1)(d), his Honour has failed altogether to have regard to general deterrence by implicitly accepting that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment.  This failure, in addition to his failure to approach the section in a principled way, was said to have contributed to the inadequacy of the sentence.
222The Crown acknowledged that an offender's purpose in accessing child pornography is one of the factors involved in an assessment of the seriousness of the offence.  However, the Crown submitted that even on the appellant's case, accessing the video files had an inherent financial motive in so far as the sentencing judge accepted that the appellant's purpose in accessing (and possessing) the child pornography was to develop software which he could exploit for commercial gain.  
223The appellant countered with the submission that to advance that argument on a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentence is specious given that the Crown's approach to disproving the appellant's ""scientific purposes"" defence was to seek to prove his erotic interest in underage girls.  While the Crown succeeded in disproving the defence, it failed to prove his interest was sexually deviant.  
224The appellant submitted that even were a financial motive attributed to him by his desire to develop software to frustrate the trade in child pornography, that is a motivation diametrically opposed to the great majority of offenders who access and possess child pornography for sale or dissemination to end users. We regard the appellant's commercial motives as neutral on the question of sentence.  The Crown referred to recent authority of this Court in which it has been held that the absence of any benefit or profit being obtained by an offender does not mitigate the offending:  see Saddler v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 48 at [54];  DPP v Latham [2009] TASSC 101 at [33].
225The appellant's subjective circumstances were also taken into account by his Honour in dealing with the appellant under s 19B.  In particular, his Honour appeared to take into account what he understood Dr Nielssen noted in his report in the following way:
""The Court also takes into account what was stated by Dr Nielssen in the report which was tendered, where he refers to the offender taking cannabis for the antihistamine effect on his sinus condition.  Dr Nielssen notes that the period of his elevated [mood] would have been associated with increased propensity to act on impulse while taking cannabis, and impaired recognition of the correct procedure to follow and the possible consequences of his actions in accessing material he knew to be illegal.""
226As we read Dr Nielssen's report, there is no suggestion of any causal connection between what the appellant reported to Dr Nielssen of his ""elevated mood"" whilst developing his software programs and the particular offending the subject of count 1.  Neither do we see it suggested in the report that there is a causal connection between the appellant's cannabis use at that time impairing his capacity to appreciate the consequences of accessing child pornography he knew to be illegal.
227The Crown also submitted that his Honour should have taken into account the fact that on the appellant's own admission at trial he downloaded between 1,000 and 2,000 child pornography files in November 2007 and that this undermined any suggestion in Dr Nielssen's report that the access the subject of count 1 was isolated or impulsive.  The Crown further submitted that his Honour should have taken into account the additional files the appellant downloaded so as to place the circumstances of the first access offence into context.  As we see it, his Honour was entitled to take into account the extent of the downloading in November 2007 in considering the appellant's character and antecedents generally and, in particular, for the disciplined and principled approach under s 19(1)(b)(i).  
228The Crown referred the Court to Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629 where the plurality (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) stated, at [32]:
""Taking all aspects, both positive and negative, of an offender's known character and antecedents into account in sentencing for an offence is not to punish the offender again for those earlier matters; it is to take proper account of matters which are relevant to fixing the sentence under consideration.""
229Limited in this way, there would be no breach of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383 as contended for by the appellant, were his Honour to have taken the appellant's admission to having downloaded a massive number of files into account.  Again, as we see it, the extent of downloading impacts directly on the ""triviality"" of the offending (s 19B(1)(b)(ii)) and, to a lesser extent, whether the offence was committed under extenuating circumstances (s 19B(1)(b)(iii)).
230The Crown further submitted that it was apparent from the schedule of comparative cases provided to his Honour that the offence should not have been dealt with under s 19B of the Crimes Act (Cth).  In our view, limited assistance can be gleaned from the cases to which the Crown referred given the unique features of this case.  What the Crown has to establish is that the sentence was plainly unreasonable or unjust where the criminal conduct the subject of count 1 was effectively unpunished.  In addressing that question it is not necessary to identify any error in sentencing principle:  it is the sentence itself that is scrutinised.  In this case, however, we are of the opinion that his Honour's approach to s 19B was fundamentally flawed and that his sentencing discretion miscarried for that reason.
231Even if it might be said that the context in which the offending occurred reduced the need for general deterrence, what cannot be ignored is that accessing pornography (and the possession of the material accessed) creates a market for the material irrespective of the motives of the person accessing the material.  The fact that s 91H(4)(c) has been repealed and replaced with a provision that requires a person to obtain permission from the relevant authorities before undertaking research reduces the need for general deterrence.  That does not, however, in our view, adequately address the question whether there was error in his Honour's approach to sentence in the sense discussed, resulting in an inadequate sentence.  We are satisfied that the sentence was inadequate.
232The Court retains a residual discretion under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act not to interfere even where the Crown has demonstrated error and a manifestly inadequate sentence has resulted:  see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 302 ALR 192 at [24].  The primary purpose of a Crown appeal was recently stated by the High Court in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [1] ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"".  Despite the fact that the principles relating to child pornography offences have been recently restated by this Court, as the Crown's submissions recognise, and that the proper approach to whether the discretion in s 19B(1)(d) is enlivened is well settled, we are satisfied the inadequacy of the sentence actually imposed in this case cannot be ignored and that there is no warrant for the exercise of the residual discretion in the appellant's favour.  
Re-sentence
233The substituted sentence on count 1 will satisfy the need for general deterrence and punishment and will conform with the principle of totality.  Not only was there nothing in the offence or the offending the subject of count 1 to attract the operation of s 19B (it being offending which should have resulted in a conviction being recorded), it was, in a real sense, conduct which precipitated the course of offending which followed and should be treated consistently with the sentences imposed on counts 2, 3 and 4 for that reason.
Orders
234The Court's orders are:
1. Appeal against conviction dismissed;
2. Grant leave to the appellant to appeal against the sentences imposed in respect of counts 2, 3 and 4 on the indictment;
3. Dismiss the appellant's appeal against sentence in respect of counts 2, 3 and 4;
4. Uphold the Crown appeal against sentence in respect of count 1.  Quash the order made under s 19B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and impose the following sentence:
The appellant is convicted of accessing child pornography using a carriage service on 21 November 2007, contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).  In accordance with s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) he is released without passing sentence upon his giving security in the amount of $500 to be of good behaviour for 2 years.

		05 June 2014",2014-06-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764094,Workcover v Robertsons Painting and Decorating P/L [2014] NSWDC 230,"Judgment



1The defendant company Robertson's Painting and Decorating comes before this Court charged with two offences, one under s 8(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000, a claim that it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all its employees, and in particular to Igor Kostanyuk and Ramy Osman.

2And a second summons was brought that has to be dealt with, alleging a failure to ensure that persons not in its employ, in particular Andrew Scott Baker were not exposed to risks of safety arising from the defendant's undertaking while they were at the defendant's place of work contrary to s 8(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000.

3This Act which has been repealed which remains in force for offences of particular types provides in s 8(1) that ""An employer must, so far as is reasonably practicable, ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all its employees."" There are particular duties that are set out ensuring any premises controlled by the employer where the employee works is safe and without risk to health. Ensuring any plant or substance provided by use of the employees is safe and without risk to health. Ensuring that systems of work and the working environment of the employees are safe and without risks to health. Providing such information, instruction, training and supervision as may be necessary to ensure the employees' health and safety at work.

4Section 8(2) provides that an employer must as far as reasonably practicable ensure that people other than the employees are not exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from the conduct of the employer's undertaking while they are at the employer's place of work - .

DUNCALF: Your Honour, I don't mean to interrupt, just in relation to the sections that your Honour is reading, the concept of so far as reasonably practicable wasn't part of this particular Act at the time of the offence. These offences occurred in January 2011.



HIS HONOUR: Yes.



DUNCALF: The concept of ""reasonably practicable"" wasn't implemented until June, into those particular sections until 2011. It is not part of the summons which are before your Honour. I'd just thought I'd raise that with your Honour.


HIS HONOUR: Okay. Thank you for drawing that to my attention.


5The defendant is not charged with the breach of duty alleging that he failed, or it failed, so far as is reasonably practicable. However, the other particulars, it is charged with: It has no previous convictions. It is exposed to a maximum penalty of $550,000 for each offence. There was a plea of guilty that was entered into at the earliest opportunity. That has the consequence that any penalty should be ameliorated by 25% to reflect that early plea of guilty.

6The parties agreed to a statement of facts. The statement of facts understandably dealt more with the offence under s 8(1) because that offence resulted in the death of a man. The other offence was rather directed towards the risk of injury to a person who happened to be near the site of the accident. The defendant company is a painting and decorating organisation and substantially it is run by Mr Leslie Robertson the managing director who has provided two very lengthy affidavits with annexures. The company at the time of the accident was engaged in painting work on a building. At the time the company had approximately 25 employees and engaged 20 painters as contractors. The company itself, I am satisfied, did have regard to Occupational Health and Safety normally. It spent a great deal of time and effort before the unfortunate death of Mr Osman, the man killed in this accident, in putting into place all types of Occupational Health and Safety Policies.

7The annexures to Mr Robertson's affidavit, which unfortunately does not have a date on it but apparently may have been signed on or sworn on 27 May 2014, indicates the steps that the company has taken over many years to ensure that it operated safely. Since the death of Mr Osman the company has taken further steps to tighten its procedures and ensure that events of the type that did take place would not take place in the future. The company itself is fully responsible for safety under the legislation. It cannot delegate its responsibilities to employees.

8One of the employees who obviously failed in his duties on this day was a Mr Alameddine. Mr Alameddine was the subject of separate proceedings but appears to have left the country. However, the company cannot urge as a factor to be taken into account in its favour that Mr Alameddine acted negligently and carelessly and did not do his duty.

9It was their duty to ensure that he did do his duty. It was their duty to ensure that he acted properly, they failed to do this. There was a supervisor and that supervisor had been trained in every aspect of the business, including Occupational Health and Safety but before the date of the accident, 24 January, he had not read the whole of the documented Occupational Health and Safety system of the company but had some understanding of it.

10One of the problems in my experience with many companies is they can have very extensive documentation covering all sorts of aspects of their business. They can have systems where people are required to sign acknowledgements they have read these particular systems but that is not good enough.

11When it comes to Occupational Health and Safety and particularly where companies are engaged in activities which have dangers in them they cannot rely on written documents signed by people and procedures in thick manuals. There are many organisations that do this and very often fail and find to their cost that terrible accidents happen. I am not going to name the organisations but some of them are in fact Government organisations.

12What happened on this particular day was in essence very simple. Two painters were required to go onto an elevated work platform which extended above 11 metres and work on the side of a building. Neither of them were given any training in the work of the platform apart from some cursory instructions by Mr Alameddine. Neither of them were supplied with safety harnesses or required to use them. Neither of them had a certificate of competency to operate the equipment although the law required they had one.

13The operating instructions issued by the hiring company that owned the equipment made it perfectly plain that if the equipment was on a slope of more than 5% an alarm would ring and those using the equipment should immediately desist from using it and rectify the problem of the slope as this equipment was not made to stand on slopes. Neither of the men working on this equipment were told anything about the alarms. There was a sign on the side of the equipment, whether either of them read it or not, who knows. The alarm, according to the facts, rang loudly and frequently while one or other of these men was in the air but neither of them did anything, presumably because they did not know the significance of the alarm. Ultimately, the platform fell. There are photos that show in a very stark way exactly how it fell.

14Mr Osman was thrown from the cab, if one can call it that, at the top of the arm, He was not wearing a safety harness and was killed. Mr Kostanyuk had been on that same piece of equipment a number of times, he was not killed, he was not injured when this fell but he could well have been injured or killed. Mr Andrew Scott Baker who was an electrician was working on the ground in adjoining premises. When the equipment came down he managed to get away so that it did not strike him but clearly it could have. Both Mr Kostanyuk and Mr Osman were quite fearful of working on this device and had expressed that fear to one another.

15Mr Alameddine should have prevented them from working on this device because they did not have licences and they did not have safety equipment in the form of harnesses, nor were they wearing hard hats. If he failed to do that as he did, Mr Furnell should have done something about it, and ultimately, Mr Robertson should have done something about it.

16The plain fact of the matters is that people who had no competence to operate this equipment and who in fact were debarred from operating it, were operating it, they did not obey the safety direction because they did not know they existed, and disaster happened, one of them was killed and a nearby worker who was not employed by the company could have been injured as well. These facts are very stark.

17It is surprising one sense that they are so stark as the company had been operating for many years without incident and safely, it has no previous conviction, it has won various awards and the like for the way in which it conducts itself. What happened this day was a major breach or were major breaches of its duties under the legislation.

18In the period since the accident the company has co-operated fully with the WorkCover Authority and has spent a considerable amount of money to put into place new safety procedures; Apart from written programs those safety procedures are also reinforced by toolbox meetings which are held regularly.

19Exclusion zones are placed around these platforms if they are used.

20Only licensed people are allowed to use these platforms.

21All workers working at height have to wear harnesses.

22All workers have to wear fluoro vests while using machinery or scaffolding.

23Every site is checked and double checked and spotters are employed to stand on the ground and look at people who are working at height.

24Supervisors check jobs.

25If people are not complying with what they are required to do those workers are removed from the job.

26They have a ""Three strikes and you're out"" policy.

27Two warnings are given. If they are not heeded and another one is then given the worker is dismissed and that has occurred, one worker has been dismissed.

28One of the consequences of the accident is the workers compensation premiums the company had to pay went up markedly. Pre-accident they were paying something like $53,000. After the accident it went up to $220,000, and then the year after that $228,000, then started to drop to $178,000, and has now dropped to $71,000 and that reflects, according to Mr Robertson, and I would accept that, an assessment by the insurance company that the company's policies, for safety have been now implemented. Mr Robertson provided information that the cost to the company after this incident, doing things to make sure there was safety, are very considerable and amounted to an investment of $473,000. That, including, $240,000 for engaging an employee as an Occupational Health and Safety Officer.

29The company also incurred very large legal fees of some $270,000 as a result of the incident, has paid out $1,441,899.18. Mr Robertson who is 61 has delayed his retirement because of all these problems.

30Attached to the affidavit are various schedules indicating steps taken to implement Occupational Health and Safety. All of these steps are commendable. What Mr Robertson and his employees have done since the accident is obviously very desirable. It is obvious, too, from my reading of his affidavit that he and his company have been engaged for many years in very large projects and I would accept that may have done so without incident.

31He has also provided information of a financial nature showing the profit and loss of the company for each year from 30 June 2010. In 2011 to 2012 a loss of $871,000-odd was incurred and a lot of that resulted from this unfortunate accident. It has a capacity to pay a fine or fines but obviously does not want to pay the maximum fine that could be imposed. Extensive submissions were put to me both orally and in writing. I have read those submissions and I have heard the oral submissions.

32When sentencing anyone for any offence, and these are offences, the Court has to have regard to a number of important sentencing principles. First of all there are the principles of deterrence, specific and general. That is to say, imposing a penalty that deters the defendant individually from committing such an offence again. Principles of general deterrence are aimed at ensuring that penalties are of such a nature that anybody who might be tempted to commit a similar offence would be deterred from doing so.

33There is then the important principle of retribution, which does not mean vengeance, it means fixing an appropriate penalty for the seriousness of the offence. And finally, there is the principle of rehabilitation. If the defendant can be rehabilitated or has been rehabilitated that ought to be taken into account as well. Generally, the maximum penalty for any offence should not be imposed, except in rare cases, where the offender has committed the offence for the first time. Generally the maximum comes into play where the offender has offended more than once.

34What is unusual in this industrial legislation is that if an offender offends more than once, the offender is then liable to even bigger penalty of $825,000. Normally at Common Law there is one maximum penalty, not two. Industrial Law has a different approach. So I have to assess the seriousness of this matter. I have to look at the objective facts as well as the subjective features to which I have referred. Objectively these are very serious breaches, particularly the breaches pertaining to the death of Mr Osman. What happened on this day was done in complete defiance of all safety requirements, it has to be said. The company that hired the equipment made it plain what safety requirements had to be followed, they were not followed. The law required that only licensed people operate the equipment. The law required that people who operated from a height should wear safety harnesses and hard hats, that was not done.

35If the workers themselves want to behave stupidly then it is up to the supervisors to stop them doing it. It is not good enough just to have a set of procedures in a manual and get the workers to sign them. The supervisors have to apply what I would call the idiot test. If somebody behaves in idiotic fashion they have to stop them. And allowing a man to go as an unlicensed worker on a piece of equipment like this without a safety harness, working on a slope with alarms ringing is pretty idiotic, the supervision was non-existent.

36So I have to conclude that this normally very safe organisation on this occasion just utterly failed in its duties and that lead to the death of a man and the possible injury to two others. The question is, what should be done? I am required to impose a penalty that sufficiently punishes the conduct, that is, satisfies the principles of retribution and acknowledges also principles of deterrence. That requires me to impose a significant fine for the major matter and a lesser fine for the other one. The organisation continues. The organisation continues to employ people and the organisation is normally safe.

37It would be inappropriate to impose anything like the maximum penalty because that would be likely to drive it out of business and would be a punishment in excess of what should be imposed. However, a severe enough punishment needs to be imposed to indicate to anybody engaged in the building industry that mere compliance with rules about having safety procedures on paper is not good enough, and so;

38For the offence under s 8(1) I impose a fine of $150,000, and for the offence under s 8(2) I impose a fine of $10,000. I order the defendant to pay the agreed costs of WorkCover and I order a moiety of 50% of the fines to be paid to WorkCover.

		11 December 2014",2014-06-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764095,R v Briggs (No 5) [2014] NSWSC 854,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Section 5BAA of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (NSW) (""the Act"") is as follows:
5BAA   Taking evidence of government agency witnesses from outside courtroom or place where court is sitting-proceedings generally
(1)  Subject to any applicable rules of court, a government agency witness must, unless the court otherwise directs, give evidence to the court by audio link or audio visual link from any place within New South Wales.
(2)  Subsection (1) does not apply unless the necessary audio links or audio visual links are available or can reasonably be made available.
(3)  The court may make a direction under subsection (1) on its own motion or on the application of a party to the proceedings.
(4)  The court may make such a direction only if it is satisfied: 
(a)  that the evidence to be given is likely to be contentious, and
(b)  that it is in the interests of the administration of justice for the government agency witness to give evidence by appearing physically before the court.
(5)  In this section: 
expert, in relation to any issue, means a person who has such knowledge or experience of, or in connection with, that issue, or issues of the character of that issue, that his or her opinion on that issue would be admissible in evidence.
expert's report means a written statement by an expert (whether or not an expert witness in the proceedings concerned) that sets out the expert's opinion and the facts, and assumptions of fact, on which the opinion is based and includes a hospital report.
government agency witness means the following: 
(a)  a member of staff of the Government Service or the NSW Health Service, or a person employed in or engaged by any government agency, who has provided an expert's report for use in evidence in proceedings or proposed proceedings or who is called as an expert to give opinion evidence in proceedings,
(b)  a member of the NSW Police Force called to give evidence in proceedings to corroborate evidence in chief given by another member of the NSW Police Force for the prosecution,
(c)  any other witness of a class prescribed by the regulations.hospital report means a written statement concerning a patient, made by or on behalf of a hospital, that the party serving the statement intends to adduce in evidence in chief at the trial.
2With regard to the forensic pathologist, Dr Vuletic, it seems that the default position, if I may call it that, is that she must give evidence if an audio visual link is available, without having to attend Court in person: s 5BAA(1) of the Act. 
3Nevertheless, the parties are agreed, first, with regard to s 5BAA(4)(a) of the Act, that there is evidence to be given by the forensic pathologist that is likely to be contentious; and, secondly, with regard to s 5BAA(4)(b) of the Act, each party submits that it is in the interests of the administration of justice for Dr Vuletic to give evidence by appearing physically before the Court.
4Apart from that, it has been foreshadowed that defence counsel will seek to have the witness examine directly two objects that have been tendered in evidence; namely, a chair leg and a baseball bat.  As a matter of logistics, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for those items to go back and forth, as it were, from the Courthouse to a remote location, in order for any cross-examination to proceed in a sensible way.
5One can seriously query whether, pursuant to s 5BAA(2) of the Act, in light of that logistical aspect, in truth the ""necessary audio visual link"" is available.  
6In all of the circumstances I make a direction, contrary to the default position in s 5BAA(1) of the Act, that the forensic pathologist, Dr Vuletic, is required to give evidence in the witness box in person in this trial.

		01 July 2014",2014-06-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764099,R v Briggs (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 853,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR: An application has been made by the Crown Prosecutor to have Constable Hill read through his signed statement, pursuant to s 33 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), as his examination-in-chief.  Defence counsel has opposed that course.  The statement became exhibit G on the voir dire.  
2The chronological background is that the statement recounts events that occurred some time after 3.45pm on 24 December 2012 at Armidale.  It also recounts subsequent events with regard to which I understand there to be no objection to the statement being read.  
3The statement is dated 26 December 2012, but it seems that it was signed by the witness at 12.30am on 27 December 2012.  Counting from 3.45pm  on 24 December 2012, that is two days and almost nine hours after the events in question.  
4Section 33 of the Evidence Act is as follows:
33   Evidence given by police officers
(1)  Despite section 32, in any criminal proceeding, a police officer may give evidence in chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer.
(2)  Evidence may not be so given unless:
(a)  the statement was made by the police officer at the time of or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers, and
(b)  the police officer signed the statement when it was made, and
(c)  a copy of the statement had been given to the person charged or to his or her Australian legal practitioner or legal counsel a reasonable time before the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution.
(3)  A reference in this section to a police officer includes a reference to a person who, at the time the statement concerned was made, was a police officer.
5Only s 33(2)(a) is in dispute.  In a nutshell, the question is whether the statement was made ""soon after"" the occurrence of the events to which it refers.  
6There is a paucity of authority on the point even though, as I understand it, s 33 replaced the almost identical s 418 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) when the Evidence Act commenced in 1995.  In Orchard v Spooner (1992) 28 NSWLR 114, Newman J extracted a passage from the Second Reading Speech with regard to s 418 of the Crimes Act.  That passage demonstrates that the section was originally directed to ameliorating the laborious process of police officers attempting to memorise statements, and then going through the process at common law analogous to the current s 32 of the Evidence Act.  The then Attorney General described that process as a ""farce"".  
7Newman J said at 119B:
""It is a question of fact for the court hearing a matter to determine whether a witness' statement falls within the indefinite time restraints referred to in the subsection.""
8In that case his Honour held that the reading of a statement made six weeks after the events in question did not fall within the section.  
9In Steve v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 231; 189 A Crim R 68, although there was a ground of appeal founded upon the section, in the event senior counsel for the appellant did not submit that a statement made approximately eight days after the events in question did not fall within the section.  
10In Dodds v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 78; 194 A Crim R 408, the ground of appeal was founded on a misapprehension as to the timing of the events described in a statement.  The events were not those that had occurred some months before, but rather a review of those events that took place at the time of the making of the statement.  Accordingly, the ground was not upheld.  
11Finally, in Chisari v R (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 325, no error was detected in the decision of the trial judge to permit reliance upon a statement made up to eight days after the events in question.  The Court of Criminal Appeal emphasised that the question is a discretionary one, and that sometimes it will be preferable for the police witness to be led through the statement by way of questions and answers, rather than reading it.  
12Here, I consider that the statement was made ""soon after"" the events in question.  I repeat: the timeframe is no more than two days and nine hours.  
13I do not consider that there is any discretionary basis upon which I should refuse the application, bearing in mind that 18 months have passed since the events about which evidence is to be given.  
14Finally, it is a matter for the learned Crown Prosecutor whether he wishes to adduce the evidence by way of the witness reading the statement, or by way of the witness being led through it.  
15My order therefore is that the evidence will be allowed in the form foreshadowed by the Crown Prosecutor.

2764115,Mencarious v R [2014] NSWCCA 104,"Judgment
1SIMPSON J:  I agree with Adams J.
2ADAMS J: 
Introduction
3On 21 March 2006, the appellant, Ashraf Mencarious, was convicted following a trial by jury of the murder of his wife Nevine Youseff.  He was sentenced on 7 July 2006 to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 20 years commencing 15 December 2004, with a balance of term of 6 years and 8 months to expire on 14 August 2031.  He appealed from his conviction and sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  On 14 October 2008 the appeals were dismissed.  The appellant, in late 2013, applied under s 78 of Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) for an enquiry into his sentence, submitting that the judgments both of the learned primary judge and in the Court of Criminal Appeal proceeded upon a basis which was disapproved by the High Court in Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120.  Although the sentences at first instance and the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal accorded with the law as it was then understood, the appellant submitted, his sentence was imposed and subsequent appeal dismissed by applying erroneous principle.  
4The crucial passage in the judgment at first instance (R v Mencarious [2006] NSWSC 719) was -  
""[30]  Parliament has decreed that an offence of murder which is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such offence should have imposed a standard non parole period of imprisonment for twenty years. It is therefore a matter to which I must turn to determine whether your offence is in the middle of that range.
...
[35]  It is not inevitable that upon such a finding the standard non parole period must be applied if there are reasons to depart from it, and I turn to consider subjective matters raised on your behalf. In an appropriate case, such matters may operate to result in departure in favour of an offender from imposition of the standard non parole period.
...
[45] ... [After considering the question of remorse, rehabilitation, assistance to authorities and the applicant's claim that he was suffering from depression, the judge went on.]  I have concluded that this is not an appropriate case in which to depart from the standard non parole period.""
On the hearing of the appeal, the Court (McClellan CJ at CL (James and Fullerton JJ agreeing)) confirmed the judge's approach to the standard non parole period: Mencarious v R [2008] NSWCCA 237 at [108]. 
5The application of the appellant under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act was granted by Latham J on 20 December 2013 and the matter referred to this Court for redetermination of the sentence.  By a combination of s 88(2) s 85(4) the matter is to be treated as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  The Crown did not dispute that the sentence decisions were in error but submitted that the Court should dismiss the appeal under s 6(3) of that Act on the ground that no lesser sentence is warranted in law.  
6It is, of course, for this Court to determine itself whether there was an error of law, although the parties are agreed that there was.  It is unnecessary, however, to engage in any analysis.  In my view, the concession of the Crown that the sentence proceedings miscarried, although approached in the way that, at the time, was binding on the trial judge, is appropriate.  Error of law having been established, it is necessary for this Court to consider first whether the appellant should be re-sentenced and, if so, determine the appropriate sentence.  
The facts
7These were not in dispute, although certain inferences drawn by the primary judge were submitted to be unjustified by Mr Barrow, counsel for the appellant.  The appellant's first marriage having failed sometime before, he and the deceased entered into an arranged marriage.  They were married in January 2002 in Egypt, the appellant returning to Australia in February 2002, but the deceased's arrival was delayed to August 2003 due to immigration requirements.  The marriage was not a happy one.  They had a son in July 2004.    
8The deceased had come to reside at a women's refuge after having been rescued by a police officer who found her shaking, crying and very distressed by the side of a remote rural roadway where the appellant had abandoned her.  The appellant told police that the deceased ""needs to understand her place here and respect me.  I am on my way home and I don't want her to come back"".   At this time their child was only a few months of age.  Overall, the learned primary judge concluded that the appellant did not regard his marriage as a partnership but that his wife was a subordinate who was subject to his dictates.  Although an apprehended violence order had been taken out, the appellant and the deceased continued to have contact and they met from time to time, although this was also in breach of the rules of the refuge.  The appellant killed the deceased at a hotel where they had arranged to spend the night together.
9The appellant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings, amongst other things, concerning the events of the night in question.  He claimed that the second marriage failed mainly because the deceased entered it to facilitate the migration of her family to Australia.  The judge rejected the evidence of both the appellant and his sister about this matter, commenting about the latter that she had a tendency to unacceptable overstatement, exemplified by her statement that the appellant had been ""always... a wonderful family man and an amazing father [who] absolutely loves, adores and cherishes all three of his children as they do him"".  His Honour said he gained the impression that the appellant's answers were contrived and he was not candid.  In particular, he rejected as incredible that, despite the deceased's agreement to spend the night with him, he thought she was not seeking genuine reconciliation.  
10On the appellant's account, when he and the deceased arrived in the hotel room they had some drinks, ordered and consumed pizza, watched some television and then had intimate relations.  Reconciliation was discussed but, when the discussion turned to the possibility of the appellant sponsoring the deceased's brother to Australia (a subject that had been the cause of substantial friction in the past), the appellant claimed he realized her primary concern was the welfare of her brother and her apparent affection for the appellant was not genuine.  His Honour dismissed this claim as incredible.  Whatever triggered his (""savage"") attack on the deceased, the appellant struck her with considerable force multiple times to the head with a bottle.  The appellant said that he did this to force her to release a bite hold on his finger.  The judge accepted that, at some stage the deceased did bite his finger, but this was trivial given that it was treated with antiseptic and a bandaid.  The primary judge accepted that the appellant drank alcohol during the evening.  (There was no alcohol detected in the blood of the deceased.)  Of critical importance was the fact that she died from asphyxiation following the beating although the precise mode by which this was inflicted by the appellant was never explained.  
11The jury having convicted the appellant of murder, it was a question for the primary judge to determine whether the appellant had intended to kill the deceased as distinct from intending to inflict grievous bodily harm.  His Honour concluded that he intended to kill the deceased.  The judge pointed out that the appellant left the hotel by avoiding areas where he might have been filmed by security cameras.  He did not attempt to contact reception in order to summon an ambulance nor do anything himself about summoning assistance, although he had a mobile phone with him which he used to telephone a taxi.  
12After a delay of some hours the appellant drove himself to a police station, telling the duty constable that he thought he had ""done something horrible to my wife"".  He later spoke to a senior officer and conveyed the same information, adding that he thought he had killed her because he hit her a few times over the head with a bottle of bourbon.  The judge concluded that the appellant's admission that he had hit the deceased with a bottle could easily be demonstrated and was intended to conceal having killed her by suffocation.  
13The primary judge concluded that, although the appellant's use of the bottle to assault his wife ""occurred during an explosion of passion, whether provoked by the comparatively minor bite on your finger or her raising the subject of her family or anything else"", his subsequent act of killing her by asphyxiation fell ""well outside the category of lower objective seriousness"".  This conclusion was inevitable.  The Crown in the present appeal submitted that his Honour's conclusion meant that he rejected the probability that the asphyxiation occurred during the ""explosion of passion"".  I do not think that his Honour so concluded.  Rather, his Honour's reasoning, as it seems to me, was that the appellant's emotional state at the time he asphyxiated his wife, whatever it was, did not significantly reduce the objective seriousness of the offence, noting that the ""act was deliberate and separate from the attack with the bottle and ... intentionally fatal"".   
Subjective features
14Testimonial letters were tendered on the original proceedings.  Although their significance is a matter for this Court to determine, my reading of them leads me to respectfully agree with the primary judge's approach to them - 
""[36] ... I have no reason to think that the various authors are other than well meaning but the utility of their expressions is somewhat diminished by the absence of any acknowledgement of the detail of your crime, which not only involved a savage attack, but a subsequent and intentional killing.  One author referred to a ""sad accident"" and others, in differing ways, expressed levels of disbelief.""  
His Honour concluded - 
""[36] ... Of course it can be said to be out of character for you to commit the crime, as I accept that your life to date has been free of conviction for any offence whatever, but I would be inclined to give greater weight to the proposition that your crime was out of character if I were persuaded that you were remorseful for what you had done.
[37]  I am not so persuaded.  At the sentencing hearing you expressed sorrow and regret but were extremely reluctant to specify just what it was that your sorrow and regret was for.  I consider that you are a self centred person and have sought to manipulate the facts and circumstances as far as you are able in order to disguise the extent of your culpability.  You are not to be additionally punished by reason of that conclusion but it is a circumstance to be weighed when I consider whether this is an appropriate case in which to ameliorate the imposition of the standard non parole period.""
In my view, there was ample material justifying the judge's conclusions about lack of remorse and his Honour was entitled to apply this finding for the purposes of sentence.  
15The primary judge found himself unable to make a positive finding of likely rehabilitation, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree.  However, of course, this is of somewhat less significance given the lapse of time since the appellant's imprisonment commenced.  There is some evidence about this matter in tendered material and I will deal with it in due course.  
16His Honour noted that a psychologist reported the appellant had suffered depression since his wife's death but did not say that this arose from her death.  Rather it was associated with incarceration which would worsen with a lengthy period of imprisonment.  In my view, his Honour rightly rejected these opinions as significantly mitigatory.  
Submissions 
17Counsel on behalf of the appellant submitted that a lesser sentence is warranted in law given the appellant's lack of any prior criminal record, that this was the first time he had been imprisoned, that he had no history of violence or any addiction to drugs and alcohol and, finally, that the offence was not planned and probably the result of a loss of control during a conflict with the victim.  The Crown prosecutor in this Court did not take issue with this submission, except for the last, contending that the primary judge found there was no loss of control.  I have set out above the passage in his Honour's reasons dealing with this issue.  I do not think that his Honour went so far as to reject the reasonable likelihood of a heightened emotional state at the time of the killing but it was nevertheless ""deliberate"".  In effect, his Honour concluded the appellant's emotional state, whatever its extent, it was not so significant as to place the crime in the lower range of objective seriousness.
18In accordance with well established principle, ameliorating or mitigating features relevant to sentence are for the offender to establish on the balance of probabilities.  Once it be accepted that the appellant was not telling the truth about what actually happened, there is no basis, as it seems to me, for concluding in his favour that there was such a significant emotional upset as to justify a mitigation of the seriousness of the offence.  The primary judge had the significant advantage over this court of hearing the appellant give evidence both during the trial and on sentence.
Present circumstances
19The appellant has spent most of his sentence in maximum security on protection, with a period of five months in Parklea in 2008 for Family Court hearings.  In his affidavit, tendered without objection, he said that, although he gradually adjusted to the day to day routine of gaol life he was unable to ""manage the emotional distress that I was feeling about being responsible for my wife's death"" and, in 2005 ""began taking medication for depression which has continued to the present time"".  He says also - 
""Each day I think about my late wife Nevine and the grief I have caused her family, my family and our son... I don't think it will ever get easier to cope with this, although the medication is helping me to sleep better and manage my day.  However, it doesn't dull my feelings of guilt, shame and revulsion that I am responsible for her death.  I feel a deep sorrow which will last my life time.""
20The appellant describes his present continuing relationship with his youngest child and reconciliation between the deceased's family and his family over the last four years.  It appears also that he has re-established contact with his daughter from his previous marriage.  He has been regularly visited by his parents, sister and niece.  He has also been supported by a priest of the Coptic Orthodox Church of which he is a member.  It appears he has been working well within the gaol system, in particular in the textiles department and in undertaking educational programs.  He says (and I would accept) that he has been assessed by the psychologist as not suitable for the Violent Offenders Therapy program because of his assessment as low risk but has been advised that there are two other programs that would be more suitable, the Domestic Abuse and the Real Understanding of Self-Help programs.  He has been placed on the waiting list for both of them.   
21The only controversial part of this affidavit relates to the genuineness of his remorse.  He was not called to give evidence of this at the proceedings before us but, on the other hand, the Crown did not seek to cross-examine him.  Though indirectly, it seems to me that the reconciliation between the families provides some support, at least, for his expressions of remorse.  I am prepared, for present purposes, to accept that he is now somewhat remorseful.  However, the language in which this is expressed does not deal with what appears to be the fundamental underlying attitude towards the deceased which, as I understand the facts and the findings of the primary judge, was a substantial contributor to his forming the intention to kill.  It seems to me, until that factor has been acknowledged and repudiated as appropriate, his expressions of remorse can only be regarded as qualified.  
22One other matter requires some short discussion.  It will be recalled that the appellant turned himself into police a few hours after committing the murder.  This is capable of being regarded as assistance to the authorities within the meaning of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and, given the substantial public interest in encouraging offenders to surrender themselves to police, gives rise to the need to consider whether any downward adjustment should be made to the sentence otherwise appropriate.  However, in this case, it is clear that the appellant understood that his identification as the deceased's assailant was inevitable and he approached police in order to make such excuses as he was able in the hope that he might escape punishment, if not for the violent assaults, at least for murder.  Accordingly, I would not in this case make an allowance for his surrender to the police.  
Conclusion
23This was an extremely serious crime in which the requirements of general deterrence are of particular point since a significant part of the appellant's motivation was his attitude to the status of his wife as opposed to his own, a view which the Court sees all too frequently in cases of so called domestic violence.  There are no special circumstances justifying a variation of the ratio provided by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  Since, in my view, a sentence of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 20 years with a balance of term of 6 years and 8 months is the appropriate sentence, it follows that I do not accept that a lesser sentence is warranted in law and accordingly I would dismiss the appeal.  
24McCALLUM J:  I agree with Adams J.

2764145,Colomer v R [2014] NSWCCA 51,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Davies J. While preferring to refer to the legally essential reasons given by a judge for imposing sentence as the 'reasons' or 'judgment' on sentence, rather than as 'remarks', I also agree with the reasons of Davies J.

2This not being a case in which the evidence tendered on appeal should be admitted, it is not desirable to seek to resolve the ambiguities and disparities in approach in judgments referring to the circumstances in which it is appropriate to admit ""fresh"", ""further"" or ""new"" evidence.

3FULLERTON J: I agree with Davies J.

4DAVIES J: The Applicant stood trial on 19 October 2012 in relation to a number of charges arising out of an incident at a Bunnings store at Bonnyrigg on 5 August 2010. The Trial Judge directed verdicts of acquittal in respect of three counts and the jury returned guilty verdicts in respect of three counts as follows:

Count 2: Use an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence whilst in company. The maximum penalty is 15 years imprisonment.

Count 3c: Fire a firearm (a pistol) in a public place. The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment.

Count 4: Possess a prohibited firearm (a pistol) without being authorised by a licence or permit. The maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of three years.

5The Trial Judge, Acting Judge Nicholson SC, sentenced the Applicant as follows:

Count 2: A non-parole period of four years and six months commencing 5 August 2010 and expiring 4 February 2015 with a balance of term of two years and six months expiring 4 August 2017;

Count 3c: A non-parole period of four years and six months commencing 5 August 2010 and expiring 4 February 2015 with a balance of term of two years and six months expiring 4 August 2017;

Count 4: A fixed term of 18 months commencing 5 August 2010 and expiring 4 February 2012. 

6The Applicant originally sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on the following two grounds:

1. The Sentencing Judge erred in finding as an aggravating fact that the Applicant ""wracked the pistol by pulling back the breech cover, thereby elevating a bullet into the firing chamber"";

2. The Sentencing Judge erred in approaching the task on the basis that there existed ""an imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community"".

7However, at the outset of the hearing of the appeal the Applicant sought leave to add a further ground of appeal as follows:

3. The Sentence proceedings miscarried by virtue of the absence in evidence of a letter and statement from Mr Amiouni dated, respectively, 23 September 2011 and 9 February 2012.

Facts

8The following is a summary of the facts found by the Sentencing Judge. 

9At the Applicant's direction, the Applicant's father and an employee of the Applicant, Matthew Varghese, had attended the Bunnings store earlier on the day the offences were committed to purchase a drop saw and a compressor. As they were in the process of leaving the store they were stopped by a Bunnings employee who thought that they might have been shoplifting. 

10A security officer, Mr Amiouni, came upon the scene. He established that there was no wrongdoing and said that both were free to leave. Both the Applicant's father and Mr Varghese were upset by the incident and made their displeasure known by swearing at Mr Amiouni and the Bunnings employee. They were then asked to leave the store. 

11What the Applicant's father and Mr Varghese told the Applicant when they returned to work is not clear but the Applicant's case at trial was that there had been a confrontation between his father and Mr Amiouni. The Sentencing Judge found that there was absolutely no foundation for the Applicant to believe such a thing.

12The Applicant decided to act. He armed himself with a small .25-calibre automatic Colt self-loading pistol by taking it from where it was kept and placing it in the left-hand pocket of a hooded top that he was wearing. His possession of that pistol from the time of securing it in his clothing to the time of disposing of it at a later time constituted count 4 on which he was convicted.

13The Applicant took with him Mr Varghese and a young family relative. They drove to the Bunnings store. They parked near the trade door exit and the Applicant put some sort of cover over the rear number plate on his vehicle.

14The Sentencing Judge was satisfied that it was the Applicant's intention that his young relative, who was well built, and Mr Varghese would support him while he dealt with the person who he believed was the Loss Prevention Officer at the store. The Sentencing Judge was satisfied that the Applicant's intention was to confront the security officer in an aggressive manner but his Honour was not able to discern the purpose of the Applicant in arming himself with the pistol in advance of his arrival at the store. 

15When in the store the Applicant and his companions first encountered the floor manager Andrew McDonald. The Applicant said that he wanted to be taken to store security and asked Mr McDonald to point out the security officer. When Mr McDonald asked why the Applicant needed to see the security officer the Applicant replied on two separate occasions that the security officer had been rude to ""my mates"". Nothing was said about the Applicant's father. 

16Coincidentally, whilst the Applicant and Mr McDonald were speaking, Mr Amiouni appeared from one of the aisles behind the Applicant and those with him. Mr Amiouni said that he was the store security officer and asked what the problem was. The Applicant said to Mr Amiouni ""You were rude to my friend"". He said he wanted to speak to Mr Amiouni outside. Mr Amiouni declined to go outside and said they could talk about it in the store. 

17The Applicant then moved towards Mr Amiouni so that he was about six inches from his face. He placed his left hand on Mr Amiouni's right shoulder. When Mr Amiouni said again that he was not going outside but they could speak within the store the Applicant grabbed Mr Amiouni's clothing. Mr Amiouni then pushed the Applicant's hand away. At that stage the Applicant's companion stepped closer to the Applicant. 

18Mr Amiouni then said, ""This is an assault. Back off. This is an assault. Andy you are my witness. This is an assault"". As he spoke, Mr Amiouni moved backwards.

19Mr McDonald then moved towards the group intending to intervene between the Applicant and Mr Amiouni. At the same time the Applicant moved his left hand into the pocket of his hood saying, ""That's not an assault, this is an assault."" He withdrew his hand from the pocket with the Colt pistol secured in his left fist, pointing it at Mr Amiouni. At the same time Mr McDonald was pushed back by one of the three men. 

20The Sentencing Judge then said this:

Colomer passed his right hand over the top of the Colt barrel and, in so doing, wracked the pistol by pulling back the breech cover, thereby elevating a bullet into the firing chamber. The weapon was now armed and at it (sic) most dangerous, but for the safety catches, if they were engaged. 

21Mr Amiouni reached for the Applicant's left arm which was holding the pistol, grabbing it around the forearm. A struggle then ensued with the Applicant and Mr Amiouni wrestling over control of the pistol. 

22The Applicant, Mr Amiouni and the two other men all fell to the floor with the Applicant on top of Mr Amiouni. Mr Amiouni was screaming, ""Help, help"", and a little later, ""Help, he's got a gun, he's going to shoot me. Help me"".

23A third Bunnings employee arrived and Mr McDonald told him to call the police because the Applicant had a gun. Mr Amiouni managed to free himself. He raced from the back of the store to a room near the trade entrance where he rang 000. 

24After Mr Amiouni ran off, the Applicant put the gun back in his pocket and walked towards the front of the store. Mr McDonald followed them. Mr McDonald called out to other staff ahead of them to ""Keep away, back off"". As they approached the tool shop the Applicant turned around and said to Mr McDonald, ""Stop following us. If you keep following us I'll shoot you"". The Applicant and the two others then left by the trade exit. A number of staff and two customers had gathered around and outside the trade entrance to watch them depart. 

25They returned to their truck. As the Applicant opened the door of the truck he took the gun from his pocket, turned and fired two shots towards, or in the direction of, the group gathered at the trade exit. The Sentencing Judge was not able to say when the two safety features on the pistol were disengaged. 

26The exact path of the projectiles discharged was impossible to determine as the spent projectiles were not found. 

Grounds of appeal

27The preliminary issue raised by Ground 3 is whether further evidence should be admitted on this appeal. The evidence is related to the issue raised in Ground 1 of the appeal. It is necessary first to address Ground 1 by reference to the evidence which was available to the Sentencing Judge. 

Ground 1: Wracking the pistol as an aggravating fact

28The relevant evidence at the trial about this issue came from Mr McDonald and a statement by Mr Amiouni. Mr Amiouni was unfit to give evidence. His statement was admitted when the Trial Judge ruled that he was ""unavailable"" within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). 

29The evidence in chief of Mr McDonald was relevantly this:

Q: Yes, and did he do anything when he said that?
A: That's when he reached into his - into his hoodie pocket and started having difficulty getting something out (TT216.39)

Q: And did you see what, if anything, he was having trouble getting out?
A: Well when he did get it out it was - it was silver and - and - and it was a gun.

Q: And how far away from the gun were you when you saw that? A: Well I was just in between them. I got shoved to the side so I would have been only a metre away when the gun came out.

Q: And how did you feel when you saw that?
A: Well at first it was really tiny and I thought it might have been one of those little lighters. But then he - he motioned with it with his other hand to -

Q: Again I'm -
A: Sorry

Q. - having to put on the record here, you're using your right hand in a kind of a lateral or horizontal motion? 
A: Yeah, like -

Q: Backwards and forwards over -
A: Over the gun.

Q: - a bunched left hand? 
A: Yeah.

Q: Allright.
A: So like you're cocking a gun. And he did that motion and that's
when - 

Q. I'm going to stop you there. Have you ever seen a gun cocked
before? 
A: Not in my face, no. Just on T.V."" (TT217.3ff) 

30Mr McDonald was cross-examined about what he saw the Applicant do in relation to the gun. However, the issue in dispute at the trial was not what was done to the gun when it was produced. Rather, the issue was whether the Applicant had produced the gun or had simply managed to grab it from Mr Amiouni during the course of the struggle. The Applicant contended for the latter position. Implicit in that contention was the assertion that the gun belonged to Mr Amiouni and not to the Applicant. 

31The evidence in cross-examination of Mr McDonald was relevantly as follows:
Q. You indicated yesterday and I won't take you through the whole transcript at page 217, but that he made a movement as to cock the gun? 
A. Yes, that's what it appeared like.

Q. That's what you said, ""Like you were cocking a gun""? 
A. Yes.

Q. You'd never said that in your statement did you? 
A. Not in the statement no.

Q. And that's a specific and significant fact isn't it? 
A. It is yes. Yes.

Q. So when you were trying to cooperate and be as accurate as you could with the police on 5 August 2010, do you agree with me that that would've been a relevant thing to tell them?
A. Yes, they told me to ring if any other things came to mind after the date and I rang one of the detectives and told him that, that I'd forgotten to make that in my statement. 

Q. When did you ring and tell them that?

HIS HONOUR: Wait a minute. Better question is who and then when.

KRISENTHAL: I'm sorry.

Q. Do you recall who you rang?
A. I believe it was Detective Lowe.

Q. Do you recall when you made that telephone call?
A. I think it was around the time before the video walk through, so around--

Q. Right, so before 22 March? 
A. Around that time yes.

Q. I'm not trying to pin you down to a date? 
A. I see, yeah.

Q. But using 22 March 2011 as a marker?
A. Yeah.

Q. Before that time? 
A. I believe so yes.

Q. And on 22 March 2011 Detective Lowe took another two statements from you didn't he?
A. He did yes.

Q. It's not mentioned in those statements is it? 
A. I do not recall the video thing all that well.
Q. But if I could just - would you like to have a look at your two statements, they're brief statements?
A. If you say it's not there, then I'll take your word.

Q. So even though you say that you see this man cocking the firearm, it wasn't something that you remembered on the very day that it occurred? 
A. There was a lot to remember on the day.

Q. Because what I'm suggesting on 5 August 2010, you were making specific reference to what you saw with regards to that firearm when it was produced weren't you?
A. Yes I was trying to.

Q. So, you're talking about that very specific short period of time? A. Yeah.

Q. It doesn't appear in the statement that you saw the weapon was cocked? 
A. No, it doesn't.

Q. Because what I'm suggesting to you is that you never saw the hooded man, and that's my client, but you never saw the hooded man produce a weapon at all? 
A. I would disagree with that.

Q. Because what I'd also suggest to you is that you didn't have any conversation with my client prior to him being involved in an incident with [FA]?
A. I would strongly disagree with that.

Q. That you weren't there before the struggle started? 
A. Definitely disagree with that.

Q. And when you came on the struggle you saw Mr Amiouni and the hooded man fighting over something?

HIS HONOUR

Q. Do you agree with that, that you came across--
A. No, no, that's incorrect.

Q. Physical interaction already occurring? 
A. No, incorrect.

KRISENTHAL

Q. And that during that struggle it wasn't the hooded man that was holding the weapon but rather it was Mr Amiouni that was holding the weapon? 
A. Disagree.

HIS HONOUR: I think by that you mean it wasn't the hooded man holding the butt of the weapon.

KRISTENTHAL: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Because they were apparently at some stage--

KRISTENTHAL: I accept your Honour's correction, yes.

Q. Do you understand the difference?
A. Yes, I understand the difference.
Q. What I'm suggesting to you is that the butt and the hand wrapped around the butt was being done by Mr Amiouni 

A. I understand, I disagree. 

Q. My client was in a struggle over that gun and that there was yelling about a gun.
A. I disagree.

...

Q. And what I'm suggesting to you is that the evidence that you've given, particularly about the conversations with my client before his involvement with [FA] are simply not right?
A. Disagree.

Q. And that he was not the person that ever produced the firearm? A. Disagree. (emphasis added)

32It can be seen that, although there was a challenge to Mr McDonald, because his Statement did not mention the Applicant cocking the gun, he was never directly challenged that he was mistaken that he had seen the Respondent make a movement ""like you are cocking a gun"". Nor was it suggested to him that his evidence was untrue. The challenges were confined to the issue of who produced, and who was holding, the gun.

33In Mr Amiouni's statement he said the following:

[12] The big guy walked up to me and stood face to face to me. I saw his hands doing something near his stomach, I looked down and I saw a Colt .22 semi automatic pistol. He was holding it in his right hand and was cocking it with his left. I know about firearms, I have a firearm licence, I am a firearms enthusiast and recognised the make and model of the pistol as soon as I saw it. 

[13] Just after he cocked the pistol, he began to point the muzzle towards my stomach.

34Early in the Remarks on Sentence the Sentencing Judge said this:

In this case the accused gave evidence contrary to the evidence of, particularly one witness, Andrew McDonald, and inconsistent with the evidence of the (sic) [Mr Amiouni's] statement before the jury. It is clear from the jury verdict that not only did the jury reject the accused's evidence, but it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew McDonald was both an honest and accurate witness. That foundational finding by the jury should be reflected in my finding of facts.

35It was on the basis of that evidence of Mr McDonald, and what appeared in Mr Amiouni's statement, that the Sentencing Judge said what is set out at [19] above and then this:

A factor enhancing the criminality of this offender is the potential for danger to Andrew McDonald, who also grappled with the offender. The offender himself and his companions were also in danger.

While I cannot find the safety catch was off, I do find, in the dynamics of the situation, that they were not so secure as to guarantee, even if they were on, that the weapon did not become free of mechanical restraint; and I have found that it was armed.

36The Applicant submitted that the availability of the finding as to the ""wracking"" of the pistol was not the subject of specific argument during the sentencing proceedings. As noted earlier, the issue at trial had been whether the Applicant brought the weapon to the scene. That issue was decided adversely to the Applicant as a result of the jury's verdict on Count 4. This is because he could not have been convicted of illegal possession of the gun if his possession of it only came about because he had managed to wrest the gun from Mr Amiouni during the struggle.

37The Applicant further submitted that his Honour had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant had deliberately caused a bullet to enter the firing chamber of the weapon immediately after he had pointed the weapon at Mr Amiouni, if that was a fact aggravating the offending the subject of count 2. Because there was no direct or forensic evidence supporting such a conclusion, and because the gun had not discharged during the conflict, the Applicant submitted that it was not open to find that there was a bullet in the chamber of the pistol at that time. 

38The Sentencing Judge had available to him two pieces of evidence which were entirely consistent on the point. The first was Mr McDonald's evidence, albeit he had never seen a person cock a gun other than on television. It can be seen from the cross-examination of Mr McDonald that there was no direct challenge to his assertion that the Applicant had moved his hand in a way that suggested he was cocking the gun. The second piece of evidence was Mr Amiouni's statement. That was a statement that carried considerable weight because of Mr Amiouni's knowledge of guns. 

39That evidence provided more than a sufficient basis for the Sentencing Judge to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the gun had been cocked with the result that there was a bullet in the chamber in the course of the confrontation with Mr Amiouni. There was ample basis for finding that that was an aggravating feature of the offence because in those circumstances the offence involved a grave risk of death to another person or persons: s 21A(2)(ib) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

40Although of lesser weight because of the lapse of time, the discharge of the gun, indicating that a bullet had entered the chamber at some stage, was supportive of the finding.

41Ground 1 fails.

Ground 3 - Absence of evidence

42The evidence that is now sought to be relied upon is a letter from Mr Amiouni dated 23 September 2011 and a further statement of Mr Amiouni dated 9 February 2012. 

43The letter relevantly said this:

I wanted to correct the original statement I made on the incident which occurred with the offender on the 05/08/2010 about the firearm being cocked. On 05/08/2010 when making the statement to Detective Senior Constable Olmos I clearly stated to him the offender whom I now know as Pedro Colmer (sic) had the pistol next to his stomach with his jumper slightly covering the pistol and it looked like it was being cocked before it was pointed at my direction. Now those words I used are not stated in the statement.

...

I was insured (sic) that the charges was (sic) reduced to intimidation with a firearm accepting the fact that the original statement was not going to be used in this matter and expected to make another statement correcting the mistake in the original statement. 

44The further statement of Mr Amiouni said this:

[3] On the 5th of August 2010, I made a five page statement to Detective Olmos. In paragraph 12 I said he was holding it in his right hand and cocking it with his left. In addition to this statement I remember that he was holding the pistol in his right hand against his stomach. With his left hand he grabbed his jumper and slightly covered the pistol. He looked like he was trying to cock the pistol through the jumper. [Emphasis added]

45By seeking to rely on this Ground, as well as tendering the letter and the statement, the Applicant was effectively applying to adduce further evidence. No application to that effect was filed nor was an affidavit filed or read at the hearing of the appeal in relation to the further evidence. Also tendered was a list of the documents marked for identification at the trial. MFI 4 was an email from Mario Licha, who was the Applicant's counsel at the sentencing hearing, to Stephen Makin, the solicitor at the DPP. The email from Mr Licha makes clear that the statement of 12 February 2010 was faxed to him but at that stage he was no longer instructed in the matter. However, he was later retained again and, as I have said, appeared for the Applicant at the sentence hearing. No explanation was given why the letter from Mr Amiouni and his second statement were not put before the Judge at the sentencing hearing. 

46The Applicant submits that the evidence should be received on the hearing of the appeal. The Applicant submitted further that if the evidence had been before the Sentencing Judge his Honour could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the gun was cocked, and the feature of aggravation under s 21A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act would not have been made out. 

47The general rule in criminal matters relating to the adducing of further evidence is that before the evidence will be received it must be shown that the sentencing of the Applicant, in the absence of that evidence, resulted in a miscarriage of justice with the result that an unjust sentence is permitted to stand: R v McIntee (1985) 38 SASR 432 at 435; Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 395.

48In R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359, the Court was concerned with whether a report from a psychologist obtained after sentence, which identified that the applicant was suffering from a ""significant intellectual disability"", should be received in support of a ground of appeal which challenged a finding by the sentencing judge that the applicant was ""a cunning and not unintelligent (but uneducated) man..."".

49Howie AJ (with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Smart J agreed) said (at 377):

Absent sentencing error which requires the Court to resentence an appellant, this Court should, in my view, resist attempts to place before it material which was not before the sentencing judge. Simply because the legal representatives of an appellant (very often not the particular solicitor and barrister who acted for the appellant at the hearing on sentence) feel that some aspect of the personal circumstances of the appellant was not properly investigated and, therefore, not placed before the sentencing judge, or because they consider that more attention should have been given to some subjective factor than was paid to it by the legal representatives of the appellant at the sentencing hearing, it should not generally follow that a proper basis has been made out for this Court to receive such material. Those representing an accused person before the trial court have a wide discretion to conduct the defence as they see fit and this Court should not generally interfere in the exercise of that discretion: R v Birks [(1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683-685]. I see no reason why that principle should not apply, at least to the same extent, to sentencing proceedings as it does to the actual trial.

Generally before fresh or new evidence will be received by this Court, it must be shown that the sentencing of the appellant in the absence of that evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. As a general rule, where that evidence was available to the defence at the time of sentencing, a miscarriage of justice would rarely result simply from the fact that the evidence was not before the sentencing judge, even if the evidence may possibly have had an impact upon the sentence passed.

However, fresh evidence has been received by this Court where a miscarriage of justice may have occurred because there has been incompetent legal representation at the hearing before the sentencing court: Abbott (1984) 17 A Crim R 355 or where there has been negligence or carelessness in the presentation of the defence: McKenna [CCA, 16 October 1992, unreported]. It has been held that new evidence may be admitted where the evidence has real significance to the sentencing proceedings, and where the significance of the evidence was unknown to the appellant and the existence of that evidence was not made known to the legal representatives at the time of sentencing: Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328, compare De Marco [CCA, 20 November 1995, unreported]. There is also a general power in the Court to receive fresh or new evidence where the interests of justice require that course: Many (1990) 51 A Crim R 54.

50More recently in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460, Johnson J observed at [82] that there are rare circumstances where the Court may be invited to have regard to a factor which may operate in mitigation of penalty which has been overlooked by defence counsel and the sentencing judge despite it being part of the material before the sentencing court. That is not this case. His Honour also referred at [81] to a line of authority in Victoria that spoke of the need for the circumstances to be exceptional and for there to be a demonstrated miscarriage of justice before that approach might be allowed on a sentence appeal.

R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216 at [38]-[45] involved an application by a respondent to tender evidence in the event that a Crown appeal against inadequacy was upheld. The evidence sought to put in issue the facts which were agreed in the Court below, in contrast to evidence which is customarily received on re-sentence being directed to events or matters that post-date the original sentencing. After referring to the extract above from the judgment of Howie AJ in Fordham, James J (with whom Mason P and Hislop J agreed) said:

It is apparent that the new evidence in the present case does not fit within any of the classes of cases described by Howie AJ in Fordham, with the possible exception that fresh or new evidence may be received ""where the interests of justice require that course"". The new evidence was available to the defence at the time of the proceedings on sentence and hence was not ""fresh"". As previously noted, at the hearing of the appeal counsel for the respondent expressly disavowed making any submission that the respondent had been improperly or incompetently represented by his legal advisers in the proceedings on sentence...

51As in Deng, counsel for the Applicant (who did not appear at the sentencing hearing) disavowed any submission that the Applicant had been improperly or incompetently represented by his legal advisors in the proceedings on sentence. In those circumstances, it is necessary for the Applicant to show that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the evidence not being ""fresh"" evidence but evidence that was available both at trial and on sentence which could have been placed before the Sentencing Judge with reasonable diligence. No explanation has been offered for why that was not done.

52Even if it may be accepted that the further evidence from Mr Amiouni was credible, the question is was it material to any issue raised on sentence. The question is not whether it may have produced a different sentencing outcome (in the sense that the Judge may have imposed a lower sentence), but whether the fact that it was not relied upon or referred to has been productive of a miscarriage of justice.

53In my opinion the evidence lacked the necessary materiality for a question of miscarriage to arise. The letter from Mr Amiouni says that ""it looked like it was being cocked before it was pointed in my direction"". That is entirely consistent with Mr McDonald's evidence which the Sentencing Judge accepted. The only difference of significance between the letter and the subsequent statement on the one hand and Mr Amiouni's original statement on the other is that the letter and subsequent statement refer to the gun as being partly covered by the jumper or hoodie. Mr McDonald's evidence was that he saw the weapon as it was apparently being cocked. Whether it was partly covered by his clothing is not to the point. The matter referred to in [40] above is of relevance to this consideration also.

54The sentence proceedings did not miscarry by reason of the absence of the evidence sought to be tendered. This is sufficient to conclude that ground 3 fails.

55In any event, by reason of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), even if the further evidence was capable of producing a lesser sentence, this Court would have to be satisfied that a lesser sentence was warranted and should have been imposed in those circumstances. 

56In my opinion, a non-parole period of four years and six months with a balance of term of two years and six months might be thought to be a lenient sentence in all the circumstances. It was bad enough that the Applicant armed himself with a pistol and produced it during the totally unjustified assault on Mr Amiouni. The fact that it was loaded with at least two bullets, even if the gun had not been wracked, raises the matter to a high level of seriousness. 

57The leniency is further emphasised by the fact that the Sentencing Judge made the sentence for discharging the pistol twice in the direction of a group of persons on a Saturday morning at a retail shop entirely concurrent with the sentence in respect of the use of a weapon to intimidate. Even if the Sentencing Judge was wrong to have concluded that the offence of intimidation was aggravated by the guns having been cocked it cannot be said that the sentence imposed produced a miscarriage of justice. 

58These three matters, (1) the lack of an adequate explanation for the further evidence not being placed before the Sentencing Judge, (2) the lack of cogency of the further evidence, and (3) the inability to identify any miscarriage of justice, means that the evidence should now be rejected. 


Ground 2: The focus of sentencing

59During the course of his introductory remarks the Sentencing Judge said this:
One of these offences, memory serves me, carries a standard non-parole period, and that matter will also need to be addressed. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against an imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. 

60The Applicant submitted that since the commencement of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the protection of the community is not the only purpose of sentencing. Section 3A sets out seven purposes. One of those purposes is ""to protect the community from the offender"" but that purpose is not, of course, the same as protecting the community in a general sense.

61The Applicant drew attention to what was said in Attorney-General's Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No. 2 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 515 at [57]-[58] per Spigelman CJ (Wood CJ at CL, Grove J, Sully J and James J agreeing):

[57] ... [T]his Court did not receive submissions about the impact of s 3A of the 1999 Act which also takes effect from 1 January 2003. It is arguable that some of the ""purposes of sentencing"" which must now guide sentencing decisions constitute a change of pre-existing sentencing principle. 

[58] For example, ""prior"" case law refers to the role of sentencing to protect the community, but that objective was often said to be achieved by means of rehabilitation, deterrence or retribution. Section 3A(c) now suggests that this should be regarded as a separate ""purpose"" and one concerned with protection of the community ""from the offender"".

62Those remarks must be understood in the wider context of the case and the paragraphs that follow (to which the Court was not taken by the Applicant's counsel). The Attorney-General's application in that case for a guideline judgment concerning the offence of ""assault police"" in s 60(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) was made pursuant to an application dated 10 May 2002. As Spigelman CJ noted, after that date Parliament amended the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in 2002 to take effect from 1 February 2003 with the amending Act introducing (inter alia) s 3A.

63That led Spigelman CJ to say: 

[59] It may also be arguable that s 3A(c) [scil. (e)] - making the offender ""accountable"" - introduces a new element into the sentencing task. The same may be true of the reference to ""harm"" to ""the community"" in s3A(g).

[60] In the absence of argument, I would not wish to be understood to be expressing a view on these matters. The possibility that prior sentencing principle may need to be reviewed does, however, support the conclusion that the present application is premature.

[61] The guideline is sort at a time when new identification of the purposes of sentencing and the specification of the list of aggravating factors has not been considered by any courts. (emphasis added)

64It may be accepted, quite apart from s 3A, that there is a number of different purposes of sentencing which overlap with none being able to be considered in isolation: Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476; R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92; (2004) 145 A Crim R 434 at [23].

65In any event, a five member bench of this Court in R v Pogson [2012] NSWCCA 225; (2012) 82 NSWLR 60, when discussing rehabilitation, approved at [117] what was said in Vartzokas v Zanker (1989) 51 SASR 277 at 279:

The object of the courts is to fashion sentencing measures designed to reclaim individuals wherever such measures are consistent with the primary object of the criminal law which is the protection of the community.

66The argument raised by the Applicant is an arid one. It focuses on one sentence in the Remarks on Sentence and overlooks the fact that the Judge has clearly addressed other purposes including punishment and denunciation, rehabilitation and deterrence. 

67Moreover, it cannot be overlooked that the offences for which his Honour was sentencing all involved the use of a firearm. His Honour made a number of references to the underlying principles of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) set out in s 3 of the Act. Two of the underlying principles are these:

(a) to confirm firearm possession and use as being a privilege that is conditional on the overriding need to ensure public safety, and

(b) to improve public safety:

(i) by imposing strict controls on the possession and use of firearms, and

(ii) by promoting the safe and responsible storage and use of firearms.

68When the Remarks on Sentence are read as a whole, I do not consider that the Sentencing Judge's statement, that sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community, was an error that infected the sentencing process. 

69In any event, even assuming his Honour erred in making that remark, the ultimate task for this Court is to determine if some less severe sentence is warranted in law. For the reasons I gave when considering Ground 3 I am not persuaded that any lesser sentence is warranted.

70I propose the following orders:



1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

		18 June 2014",2014-06-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764146,"Kennedy v Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage [2014] NSWCCA 107","Judgment
1WARD JA:  Mr Kennedy pleaded guilty to, and was convicted on 20 July 2012 by the Land and Environment Court of, an offence against s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (NSW) (the Native Vegetation Act).  The offence, as charged in the prosecutor's summons filed 5 July 2011, was that, between about 1 June 2009 to about 31 August 2009 inclusive, at or near Bendemeer in the State of New South Wales, Mr Kennedy cleared native vegetation otherwise than in accordance with a development consent granted in accordance with the Native Vegetation Act or a property vegetation plan.
2The summons particularised the place of the offence as being the property ""Greenmount"" at Green Valley Road in Bendemeer and the native vegetation alleged to have been unlawfully cleared as including five species of eucalyptus.  The manner of breach was particularised as being:
(a) The Defendant instructed Bernard Joseph Kennedy and/or another person or persons to clear native vegetation and Bernard Joseph Kennedy or other such person or persons cleared the native vegetation using a bulldozer and chainsaw; and/or 
(b) The Defendant was the landholder of the land on which the clearing of native vegetation was carried out.
3The date on which evidence of the offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer was particularised as being 29 July 2009 (the officer in question being identified as Mr Stephen Beaman).  The particulars did not identify the actual area of land cleared during the relevant period.
4On 9 December 2011, the sixth mention of the matter before the Court, Mr Kennedy, through his then counsel, pleaded guilty to the offence.  The matter was then listed for hearing in the Land and Environment Court in July 2012, at which time Mr Kennedy represented himself.  On 20 July 2012, Mr Kennedy was convicted of the offence as charged and was fined the sum of $40,000.  He was ordered to pay the prosecutor's costs of the proceedings ([2012] NSWLEC 159). 
5Mr Kennedy now appeals from his conviction and sentence.  Pursuant to s 5AB (read with s 5AA) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), such an appeal lies as of right.
Background
Agreed facts
6Filed in the Land and Environment Court proceedings was a Statement of Agreed Facts.  Briefly, it records the following:  that at the time of the alleged offence the property known as ""Greenmount"" was owned by Mr Kennedy; that some of the vegetation on the property prior to December 2005 was dense and included trees that were between 10 and 20 metres high and included various types of eucalypts; that clearing of native vegetation was carried out on the property at Mr Kennedy's direction and consistent with his verbal instructions between approximately June and August 2009 by Mr Kennedy's brother using a bulldozer, chainsaw and log loader; that some of the overstorey of the vegetation that was cleared comprised large native trees; and that native groundcover, mid-storey shrubs and juvenile eucalyptus were also cleared.
7It was agreed that the clearing was not carried out in accordance with a property vegetation plan or development consent issued under the Native Vegetation Act.  It was also agreed that the clearing was not authorised or permitted by any direction issued by a Catchment Management Authority; nor under the Rural Fires Act 1997 (NSW) or any Bushfire Management Plan or direction issued by the Rural Fire Service; nor under any direction or order issued by the Livestock Health and Pest Authority or its predecessor.
8It was further agreed that Mr Kennedy had no prior convictions for environmental offences in New South Wales but had been issued with a remedial direction under s 47 of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 (NSW) in January 2005 in respect of unlawful clearing of other land.
Mr Kennedy's evidence
9Mr Kennedy, who is a grazier, affirmed an affidavit on 23 February 2012 (parts of which were the subject of objections and either not read or not admitted).  In that affidavit, he deposed to the run-down condition of Greenmount when the property was purchased by him in about 2005; that the country varied from completely cleared to small regrowth with a large amount of dead fallen timber; that it was obvious to him that the property had been logged over many years; and that many areas were completely inaccessible to him.  He said that the property had been stocked heavily with sheep and was very bare; and that there were signs of pigs and substantial rabbit warrens over the property.
10Mr Kennedy deposed that he removed the sheep from the property; ran only cattle to allow the pasture and country denuded by sheep to recover and to reseed; and that he had granted several shooters access to the property to shoot feral game and rabbits.
11Mr Kennedy said that there had been an ongoing rabbit and pig problem on the property and that he had engaged his brother ""to bulldoze and burn the regrowth as the rabbit infestation and resultant land damage was totally out of [his] control without immediate action"" ([49]).  Mr Kennedy said that the timber was small regrowth, dead fallen timber and old heaps.  He asserted that it was within the exemptions for clearing, as was clearing for tracks and fencelines ([51]).
12Mr Kennedy further said that there was some timber for farm use which he intended to use for sheds and yards ([52]).  He deposed that regrowth and dead timber was burnt over the next 8 weeks ([54]), which he said would not have been possible with bigger timber as it would need to be stacked for many months to allow it to dry enough to burn ([55]).  He said that retained logs were stacked, measured and stamped as he intended to send them off site to be milled, but that the log quality was not good enough for that to happen ([56]-[58]).
13Relevantly, Mr Kennedy's affidavit explained his understanding of the guilty plea that was entered on his behalf.  He deposed that he had pleaded not guilty since receiving the summons ([106]); that he was unaware that failure to use timber cut under routine agricultural management activity (RAMA) provisions for on farm use within a set time was a breach of the Native Vegetation Act (at [107]); that he had not used the timber within the specified time ""and I am guilty to that breach however it was not intentional"" at [108]; and that he believed that ""this breach"" should be mitigated by the circumstances to which he had referred.  By that he was presumably referring to his evidence as to the unintentional nature of the breach; the fact that he could not proceed with the proposed building/yards as there was no income to fund the work due to the cost of the remediation order demanding removal of stock and that the past two years had been very wet preventing earth works or building being undertaken.
14At [112], Mr Kennedy deposed that he had ""therefore"" changed his plea from not guilty to guilty.  At [113], Mr Kennedy stated that ""[t]he guilty plea relates only to failure to use timber within a specified time"".
Guilty plea
15There was no qualification on the plea of guilty at the time it was made on behalf of Mr Kennedy by Mr Bolger.  At that time, the Court was informed that Mr Kennedy sought to call some expert as to the degradation of the property and as to other matters in mitigation.
16When the matter came before Biscoe J for sentence in July 2012, his Honour expressed concern as to whether Mr Kennedy understood whether he really wanted to plead guilty.  There were a number of exchanges between his Honour and Mr Kennedy in which his Honour sought to elucidate whether Mr Kennedy maintained his guilty plea (having regard to the time that had by then been spent in the hearing on whether or not he came within certain exceptions).  Mr Kennedy agreed with the proposition that what he was saying at [113] of his affidavit was that his perception was that he had to do something within a specified time with the timber (i.e., use the felled timber for construction on the farm) and that ""except for that [he] would be not guilty"".
17His Honour pointed out to Mr Kennedy that the time limit was not as to whether the timber was in fact used in that period but whether it was cleared for use within that time limit; which raised an issue as to whether, at the time the timber was cleared, Mr Kennedy intended to use the timber within 18 months - that being a matter on which the onus was on Mr Kennedy.  Mr Kennedy informed his Honour that he had obtained a quote for the construction of the shed (for which the timber was going to be used) in June 2010 and that the construction was going to be done within that year 2010.  Asked whether he was going to use all of the timber (for that purpose) Mr Kennedy said at first that some of it was exempt, for tracks, fence lines and regrowth, but then said that he was going to use all of it.  Presumably that answer should be understood as meaning all that was not otherwise exempt.  His Honour noted that there was no evidence of this in Mr Kennedy's affidavit but then went on to ask Mr Kennedy if he was content to maintain his guilty plea, to which Mr Kennedy said:
Yes, in respect of not using the timber, yes
18Counsel for the prosecutor expressed a concern that Mr Kennedy was seeking to carve out a part of the charge to which he was content to plead guilty.  His Honour then indicated that, as he understood the guilty plea, it indicated that some of the clearing was unlawful and that the issue was as to the extent of the unlawful clearing.  His Honour proceeded on that basis.
Prosecutor's evidence
19The prosecutor relied, among other evidence, on an affidavit affirmed 4 July 2011 by a compliance investigator employed by the Office of Environment and Heritage, Department of Premier and Cabinet (OEH), Mr Glendon Turner.  Mr Turner was at all relevant times an authorised officer within the meaning of s 34 of the Native Vegetation Act.  He was the officer within the Department who was assigned the task of investigating the alleged illegal clearing of native vegetation on the Greenmount property ([6], [15] of his affidavit).
20At [16] of his affidavit, Mr Turner deposed that he first received knowledge of the clearing of native vegetation on the property on 24 August 2009 when he received an email from a departmental officer (Mr Bryce Gorham) providing details of ""clearing activity"".  Mr Turner deposed to his inspection of the property on 25 August 2009, from the fenceline, where he observed burning stacks of vegetation on the property and took photographs of a dozer operating on the property.  He obtained authorisation to enter the land and took various photographs of the vegetation and cut logs.  He further inspected the property on 31 August 2009 in the company of Mr Beaman, again having obtained authorisation to enter the land, and took other photographs on the property.  On 10 September 2009, he and Mr Beaman took a helicopter flight over the property and took digital photographs of the property and adjoining land.  Further site visits were made by Mr Turner on 21 June 2010 (in the company of Mr Beaman) and 4 May 2011, in the company of Dr Christopher Nadolny, a botanical ecologist employed by OEH.
Relevant Statutory Provisions
21Section 12 of the Native Vegetation Act provides as follows:
12 Clearing requiring approval 
(1) Native vegetation must not be cleared except in accordance with: 
(a) a development consent granted in accordance with this Act, or 
(b) a property vegetation plan. 
(2) A person who carries out or authorises the carrying out of clearing in contravention of this section is guilty of an offence and is liable to the maximum penalty provided for under section 126 of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW)] for a contravention of that Act.
(3) It is a defence in any proceedings for an offence against this section if it is established that the clearing was permitted under Division 2 or 3 or was excluded from this Act by Division 4.
22""Native vegetation"" is defined in s 6(1) of the Native Vegetation Act as meaning any of the types of indigenous vegetation there specified (including trees and understorey plants).  Section 6(2) provides that vegetation is ""indigenous"" if it is a, or comprises, species of vegetation that existed in the State before European settlement.
23Section 9 deals with what is meant by remnant native vegetation and regrowth:
9 Meanings of remnant native vegetation and regrowth
(1) For the purposes of this Act, remnant native vegetation means any native vegetation other than regrowth.
(2) For the purposes of this Act, regrowth means any native vegetation that has regrown since the earlier of ... :
(a) [in the case of the subject land] 1 January 1990 ...
24Subject to any exclusion in a property vegetation plan, s 19 of the Native Vegetation Act permits the clearing of native vegetation that is ""only regrowth"" (but not ""protected regrowth"" as defined in s 10).   
25Section 22, in Division 3 of the Native Vegetation Act, permits clearing for routine agricultural management activities in the following terms:
22 Routine agriculture management activities 
(1) Clearing for routine agricultural management activities is permitted.
(2) This section does not authorise any clearing of native vegetation: 
(a) if it exceeds the minimum extent necessary for carrying out the activity, or 
(b) if it is done for a work, building or structure before the grant of any statutory approval or other authority required for the work, building or structure. 
26Section 11 defines routine agricultural management activities as meaning various activities on land carried out by or on behalf of the landowner, including: (a) the construction, operation and maintenance of rural infrastructure including, among other specified infrastructure and subject to the regulations, dams, permanent fences, buildings and farm roads; (b)-(c) the removal of noxious weeds or control of noxious animals, in each case under the relevant legislation; and:
(i) any activity reasonably considered necessary to remove or reduce an imminent risk of serious personal injury or damage to property
27Section 11(2) provides that the regulations may make provision for or with respect to extending, limiting or varying the activities that are routine agricultural management activities.  Part 4 of the Native Vegetation Regulation 2005 (NSW) deals with routine agricultural management activities and, relevantly, clause 16 provides as follows:
16 Obtaining construction timber
(1) The activities that comprise routine agricultural management activities for the purposes of section 11 of the Act are extended to include the clearing of native vegetation on land for use in the construction or maintenance of rural infrastructure on the land within whichever of the following time periods is applicable to the land:
(a) [relevantly for present purposes] 18 months after the clearing for land ...
(2) This clause authorises clearing of native vegetation only if the clearing:  ...(b) is carried out in conjunction with a restoration program or other arrangements that will ensure the restoration of native vegetation on the cleared land of the same or a similar species as the native vegetation cleared and to the same or a similar extent as existed on the cleared land.
(3) This clause authorises the clearing of native vegetation only if the native vegetation does not comprise:
(a) a threatened species, or a component of a threatened population or threatened ecological community, under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 or is likely to comprise habitat of such a threatened species, ...
Land and Environment Court hearing
28In the Land and Environment Court hearing, the prosecutor's case was that, during the charge period, Mr Kennedy had cleared 44.7 hectares of native vegetation from the Greenmount property, largely comprising 2,500 to 4,000 mature trees (established before 1 January 1990).  Approximately 6-10 hectares of the area cleared was said by the prosecutor to have comprised ""White Box, Yellow Box, Blakely's Red Gum Woodland"", an endangered ecological community listed in Schedule 1, Part 3 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW). 
29The prosecutor contended that the clearing had caused ""significant"" or ""substantial"" environmental harm, relying on a report prepared by Dr Nadolny in which Dr Nadolny concluded that the overstorey of the cleared vegetation comprised large native trees, including species of eucalypts; and that the cleared groundcover was predominantly native, as well as scattered shrubs and juvenile eucalypts.  Dr Nadolny identified four distinct communities in the cleared woodland, including the White Box endangered ecological community, and assessed the number of mature trees cleared as being between 2,500 and 4,000.
30Mr Kennedy denied that White Box was present on the property and (as referred to above) gave evidence as to the nature of the vegetation that had been cleared.  He contended that: much of the native vegetation cleared comprised a little more than 600 mature trees (which he mistakenly believed were permitted to be cleared for the routine agricultural management activity of constructing rural infrastructure (sheds, a stockyard and fencing) on the property within 18 months); there was clearing to create permitted infrastructure buffer distances for existing fences, tracks, dams and firebreaks (permitted by clause 20(3) of the Native Vegetation Regulation); and that otherwise the native vegetation cleared was only non-protected regrowth that was permitted to be cleared.  He maintained that the alleged area of 44.7 hectares should be reduced to about 27 hectares if allowance was made for the area permitted to be cleared by clause 20(3) of the regulation.  He contended that there was no environmental harm.
Primary judgment
31His Honour set out his findings on the main factual issues at [5] of his reasons.  His Honour found that the area unlawfully cleared was 32.48 hectares; that the nature and extent of the native vegetation cleared substantially comprised a little more than 600 mature trees and regrowth (established since 1 January 1990); and that the previous state of the property was in essence as Mr Kennedy had described in his affidavit.
32His Honour made the following findings as to the extent of the clearing and Mr Kennedy's reasons for the clearing.  First, that a little more than 600 mature trees were felled to construct rural infrastructure within 18 months ""which at the time [Mr Kennedy] mistakenly thought was sufficient to make that clearing permissible"".  Second, that some native vegetation was also cleared to create permissible buffer distances but that some of this was cleared for buffers for firebreaks which was not permissible (but which Mr Kennedy mistakenly believed was permissible).  Third, that the balance of the native vegetation cleared comprised only non-protected regrowth which was permissible (and his Honour noted that the reason for clearing this, though not relevant, was to remove fallen timber and control noxious animals).  Fourth, his Honour noted that in consequence of the clearing the stock management of the property was to be improved.
33His Honour found that the extent of the environmental harm caused by the unlawful clearing was moderate.
34His Honour accepted Dr Nadolny's view as to the presence of the four distinct communities comprised by the cleared woodland.  In particular, his Honour accepted (at [36]) that White Box was present on the property.  His Honour did so in light of Dr Nadolny's expertise and the fact that he was not cross-examined.  However, his Honour concluded that there was much less environmental harm than Dr Nadolny had estimated, for the following reasons.
35First, his Honour noted (at [61]) that the property included areas of much regrowth, scattered bigger timber, fallen dead timber and timber heaps stumps and bare ground and had been extensively logged by earlier owners prior to 1990; and that it was overrun with rabbits and had problems with feral animals.  His Honour noted that there was no suggestion that the earlier logging was unlawful or that the regrowth followed clearing of a kind that would cause it to be excluded from the concept of regrowth under s 9(4) of the Act.
36Second, his Honour noted at [62] that Dr Nadolny's estimate of the amount of mature trees felled was theoretical and based on a comparison of trees on an adjoining stock route that had not been subject to normal agricultural activities.  His Honour noted that only 601 logs had been counted on behalf of the prosecutor in August 2009 shortly after the clearing and accepted that a further log had been felled for butcher's blocks on the property.  His Honour accepted Mr Kennedy's evidence that recently felled trees of that maturity were too green to be burned until months after August 2009.  Therefore, his Honour accepted Mr Kennedy's contention as to the number of mature trees that had been logged.
37Third, his Honour found (at [63]) that 32.48 hectares had been unlawfully cleared.  His Honour accepted an estimate made by one of the prosecutor's witnesses (Mr Spiers) that the cleared area was 44.7 hectares but reduced that by 12.22 hectares, partially accepting Mr Kennedy's estimate that 17.62 hectares had been cleared for permissible buffer distances.  His Honour calculated this on the basis that the only item for buffer breaks that the prosecutor had disputed was 5.4 hectares for firebreaks.
38Fourth, his Honour accepted Mr Kennedy's evidence that the noxious animals had been virtually eradicated, as representing an offsetting environmental benefit ([64]).  Fifth, his Honour noted that a substantial belt of native vegetation through the property remained intact ([65]).  Sixth, his Honour accepted that the number of native fauna had been greatly reduced by reason of the feral animals prior to the clearing ([66]).
39His Honour also noted that the remedial directions issued to Mr Kennedy should in due course result in remediation at his cost of the damage that had been caused.
40Mr Kennedy notes that Dr Nadolny's report was made after the land was cleared and the timber was removed; and that all that remained were logs retained for his own use and they were Stringybark.  He emphasises that Mr Nadolny was unable to find White Box logs in the retained logs.
41His Honour concluded that Mr Kennedy's conduct should be characterised as negligent rather than reckless ([72]); he accepted that the reasons for clearing the property included the commercial object of improvement of stock management but that this aggravating circumstance had been negated to a substantial degree by the remedial direction in relation to the property ([76]).  His Honour concluded that the offence committed was of moderate objective gravity (taking into account the above and other matters) ([80]); the subjective circumstances of Mr Kennedy ([81]-[89]), including the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty (for which a 20% discount was allowed); and the need for deterrence and for consistency in sentencing ([90]-[93]).  His Honour concluded that the appropriate penalty was a fine of $50,000, which was reduced by 20% to $40,000.  His Honour noted that the prosecutor's costs were said to total $36,600 but said that, in the absence of any evidence as to the means of Mr Kennedy to pay whatever fine might be imposed, he did not give significant weight to the fact that Mr Kennedy would also be ordered to pay the prosecutor's costs.
Appeal
42In his notice of appeal filed on 30 April 2013, Mr Kennedy raises various grounds of appeal that largely appear to be submissions that he should not have been convicted of the offence to which he had pleaded guilty:
1. Native vegetation was cleared under exemptions in the act. 
2. Timber retained for on farm use is exempt under R.A.M.A provisions.  The approx 600 trees harvested for farm use have not been illegally cleared.  There has been no breach of the act in regards to clearing.  Evidence has been provided as to use of timber.
3. No E.E.C existed on the property.
4. Regrowth has occurred as a natural process hence a restoration programme was not required.
43Reference is made under the heading ""Grounds for Appeal re judgement"" to particular paragraphs of the judgment, with which Mr Kennedy either takes issue or cites in support of his appeal:
Page 4 (a) stated that some 600 trees were cleared which defendant mistakenly believed were permitted under RAMA. Defendant maintains trees were exempt under RAMA and has at no stage stated he was mistaken in his actions.
Page 6 (ii) stated balance of clearing comprises non protected regrowth which the defendant was legally able to clear.
Page 7 9 Onus of proof in establishing a regrowth defence is on the defendant; Director General of the department of Environment, Climate Change and Water v Walker Corporation Pty Ltd per Preston CJ. Judge Biscoe in his findings page 6 (ii) has found excluding the 600 trees exempt under RAMA the balance of the clearing is non protected regrowth. So a regrowth defence has been established.
Page 10 13 (c) control of noxious animals under RLP act 1998 falls within RAMA.
Page 18 37 his honor [sic] finds that 600 trees only were cleared excluding regrowth which was permissible. This equates to 18.47 trees per hectare which is basically cleared land with useful farm timber remaining. 
Page 26 63 firebreaks of 5,4 hectares not allowed despite accepting defendant had concern for fire control. Defendant submits fire breaks at magistrates [sic] discretion and should be allowed.
Page 26 64 accepts environmental benefit through regrowth clearing to reduce harbour for noxious animals.
Page 28 73 dispute no restoration programme in place to restore native vegetation. Some thousands of regrowth trees are now growing on the property where only 600 were removed. EEC was never established by Nadolny as he never saw the property prior to regrowth clearing. He did not find any white box nor did he find EEC in the adjoining TSR [Travelling Stock Route] which is remnant eucalypt vegetation.
Submissions by Mr Kennedy
44Mr Kennedy served written submissions in support of his contention that his conviction and sentence should be set aside in which he again emphasised that he had pleaded guilty ""to a breach of the act being failure to use timber within given time period"" caused by wet conditions and restrictions on his property causing him loss of income.
45Mr Kennedy attached various documents to his submissions.  By reference to his description of the documents and their contents, those attachments are as follows:
A. Photographs taken on the Greenmount property on 19 April 2013 and said to show: that the area is Stringybark woodland and not a grassy White Box woodland and therefore not a threatened community; that the light soil types would not support a White Box community; and a large amount of regrowth over the entire area and timber used for on farm use and faulty logs.
B. A letter dated 24 April 2012 from the Policy Director- Environment of the NSW Farmers' Association, expressing support for Mr Kennedy and, among other things, commenting on the primary judge's reasons for judgment, expressing an opinion as to the ""deeply flawed"" regulation of native vegetation in this State and calling for changes to the legislation.
C. A statement from the Environmental Scientist/Ecologist who was called by Mr Kennedy to give evidence in the Land and Environment Court hearing (Mr Stephen Cotter) as ""further evidence"" in support of the appeal, which states that a re-examination of the evidence indicated that his Honour erred in determining that White Box was cleared from the property by reference to certain matters stated in the document [not seemingly addressed in his affidavit that was read at the hearing below], relied upon as demonstrating the lack of evidence to support a White Box community on the property.
D. Letter dated 2 April 2013 from SMK Consultants commenting on certain matters raised in the experts' reports relied upon by the prosecutor at the hearing below (being the reports of Mr Spiers and Dr Nadolny).
E. A hand-drawn map of the property and comments as to the results of a regrowth count on 19 April 2013 [incorrectly referred to in the report as 19 July 2013].
F. A document headed ""Final submissions"" that Mr Kennedy says was put before the court below, dealing with the issue of incorrect areas within polygons (referring to the report of Mr Spiers), which it is said was not addressed by the primary judge.
G. Letter dated 10 April 2013 from SMK Consultants referring to the issues of polygon interpretation. 
46Mr Kennedy also submits that 5.4 hectares of firebreaks should be allowed for community safety.
Further evidence
47Insofar as Mr Kennedy's submissions seek to rely on material that was not before the primary judge (namely, attachments A, B, C, D, E and G), the prosecutor opposes leave being granted for further evidence to be adduced.
48As to the admission of fresh evidence, in Mickelberg v R [1989] HCA 35 (at [27]); (1989) 167 CLR 259 (at 273), Mason CJ considered the appropriate test to be applied by an appellate court in deciding whether to set aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence and said:
... It is established that the proper question is whether the court considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before it at the trial. This test was endorsed by four of the five Justices in Gallagher v The Queen. Deane J and I (at 402) considered that the test was best expressed in those terms. (footnotes omitted)
[There referring to Gallagher v R [1986] HCA 26; (1986) 160 CLR 392]
49In R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 (at [63]), it was said that material available at the time of the trial could not properly be characterised as ""fresh evidence"".
50The prosecutor submits that, with the exception of the results of the regrowth count held on 19 April 2013 in attachment E, all of the material was available to Mr Kennedy at the time of the hearing and therefore cannot properly be characterised as ""fresh evidence"" (in the sense considered in Abou-Chabake).  (Attachment A would also fall within the category of attachment E in that it consists of photographs taken at that same time.)
51As to attachment E (and presumably also attachment A), the prosecutor submits that this is not of relevance to any issue on the appeal in any event.  The prosecutor apprehended that this material was sought to be relied upon to show that no restoration program was necessary and submitted (as is clearly the case for the purposes of the relevant exemption) that a restoration program is required for clearing to fall within the relevant exemption.
52However, attachment E contains a statement that none of the regrowth counted in plots or observed in other areas was White Box or the species that constitute this community and that Stringybark was by far the dominant regrowth species as on adjoining timbered areas and retained timber on the subject property.  It seems to be capable of supporting a submission by Mr Kennedy that one could infer from this that there had not in fact been White Box on the areas cleared by him and if so it would be of potential relevance (though suffers from the difficulty that evidence of that kind could have been obtained at the date of the hearing).  In this regard I note that Mr Kennedy's position was that White Box does not grow on the property and accordingly there could not be an EEC of that description.
53The prosecutor submits that none of the material now sought to be relied on, had it been available at the hearing, could have resulted in an acquittal  (assuming Mr Kennedy had not pleaded guilty), the prosecutor raises the following matters.
54First, while the prosecutor accepts that material going to the presence or absence of the endangered ecological community identified by Dr Nadolny might have relevance when considering the appropriateness of his Honour's acceptance of Mr Kennedy's guilty plea (there referring to attachments A and C), it is submitted that the presence or absence of an endangered ecological community was not something on which any defence based on clause 16 of the Native Vegetation Regulation would have turned (that defence relating to an intention to use the cleared vegetation for routine agricultural management infrastructure within an 18 month time period).
55Further, it is noted that Mr Kennedy relied on a report from Mr Cotter at the hearing and that this report did not address the issues now raised in attachment C.  Mr Cotter was cross-examined on the presence or absence of an endangered ecological community.  In the course of that cross-examination, Mr Cotter said that he had not assessed the communities which comprised the cleared vegetation; that he was ""not convinced'' that the cleared vegetation could be separated into the two or three categories that Dr Nadolny had assessed; was not in a position to assess the work undertaken by Dr Nadolny; was ""not sure"" that part of the community was an endangered ecological community; and cavilled with the proposition that Dr Nadolny could make such an assessment based on trees in a ""log dump"" or based on a transept survey on a travelling stock route ""unless you can demonstrate that it's like for like"", pointing to the fact that prior to any clearing there was no vegetation assessment.  
56Similarly, in re-examination, Mr Cotter said that his understanding was that Dr Nadolny had based his conclusion as to the occurrence of the tree species in the endangered ecological community on their presence within the log dump, querying that it could be said that all those trees in the log dump had occurred together.
57The prosecutor relies on the above and also submits that in further cross-examination Mr Cotter revealed a significant misunderstanding as to what Dr Nadolny's methodology had been.  Mr Cotter there accepted that Dr Nadolny's conclusion could more confidently be drawn based on identifying juvenile eucalypts and saplings present throughout the cleared and uncleared parts of the property and having regard to trees or patches of trees remaining standing in the property.
58The prosecutor submits that there is nothing in Mr Cotter's further report that suggests that any new material or information had become available which might cast doubt on the primary judge's acceptance of Dr Nadolny's findings as to the presence of the endangered ecological community.  It is submitted that Mr Cotter's further report reflects an impermissible attempt by Mr Kennedy to revisit a forensic decision made by him as to what evidence should be called at the trial (Ratten v R [1974] HCA 35 at [18]; (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 517).
59I accept that attachments C, D and G seek to revisit issues already dealt with at the hearing.  Even though Mr Kennedy may be given some latitude, as a self-represented litigant, for unfamiliarity with procedural aspects of the trial, it is not appropriate for fresh evidence of this kind now to be adduced by way of submission when the prosecutor has not had the opportunity to test that evidence.
60Attachment F is clearly a submission and should be read as such.
61As to the photographs in attachment A and the regrowth count in attachment E, as noted above there was some doubt as to the purpose for which reliance was sought to be placed on them.  If reliance was sought to be placed on them for the proposition that it could be inferred that, since there had been no regrowth of White Box there could not have been a White Box EEC on the property in the first place, that proposition is difficult to test without expert evidence as to the state of regrowth of such an EEC. In any event, it is not clear why such evidence could not have been made available at the hearing (which was some 3 years after the clearing had taken place).  Furthermore, for the reasons I set out in relation to the conviction appeal grounds, the presence of an EEC was relevant not to conviction but only to sentence.  That counts against its admission on the conviction appeal at this stage.
62Finally, as to attachment B, in my opinion this is of no weight whatsoever.  Advocacy by the Farmers' Association as to legislative changes should be made in an appropriate forum.  That forum is not the Court.
63I would therefore refuse leave for the admission of the further evidence sought to be relied on by Mr Kennedy but would treat attachment F as a submission relevant to his grounds of appeal.
Principles relevant to Mr Kennedy's appeal
64On an appeal of the present kind, Mr Kennedy must establish error on the part of the primary judge (Gilmour v Environment Protection Authority [2002] NSWCCA 399; (2002) 55 NSWLR 593 [19] per Santow JA; Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Director General, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water [2012] NSWCCA 210; (2012) 82 NSWLR 12 at [43]).
65The prosecutor accepts that there is jurisdiction for this Court to entertain an appeal against conviction even after a plea of guilty (referring to Lars, Da Silva and Kalanderian (1994) 73 A Crim R 91 at 109ff) but submits that for this Court to allow such an appeal in the present case it is necessary for Mr Kennedy to demonstrate that there has been a miscarriage of justice (referring to what was said in R v O'Sullivan [2002] NSWCCA 98; (2002) 128 A Crim R 371 at [9]-[12]).
66In Lars, the Court (Wood, Mathews and Badgery-Parker JJ) said that the principle to be applied was said to be the same as that to be applied in a trial court where prior to sentence an accused person seeks leave to withdraw a plea of guilty previously entered (at 109).
67The principles were restated more recently in Thalari v R [2009] NSWCCA 170; (2009) 75 NSWLR 307 at [32]-[35] referred to with approval in Clark v R [2012] NSWCCA 158 at [18] (per Johnson J with Basten JA and Garling J agreeing) and Han v R [2012] NSWCCA 257 at [18] (per Latham J with McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreeing).  In Thalari, the Court said (at [32]-[35]):
This Court may quash a conviction entered upon a plea of guilty in the sentencing court if it is demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the Appellant is not permitted to withdraw the plea: R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 36; R v Van (2002) 129 A Crim R 229; Elmir v R [2009] NSWCCA 22 at [33]ff.
The onus lies upon the Appellant to demonstrate that leave should be granted: R v Marchando (2000) 110 A Crim R 337 at 338 [4]; R v Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 A Crim R 533 at 536-537 [16]-[23]. The Appellant must establish a good and substantial reason for the Court taking the course of granting leave to withdraw the plea: R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299 at [39]; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 at 46 [39]. An application to withdraw a plea of guilty is to be approached with caution bordering on circumspection: R v Liberti (1991) 66 A Crim R 120 at 122; R v Parkes [2004] NSWCCA 377 at [48]. (my emphasis)
The plea of guilty itself is a cogent admission of the ingredients of the offence: R v SL [2004] NSWCCA 397 at [51]. Indeed, it has been described as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: Charlesworth v R [2009] NSWCCA 27 at [25].
A person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt, and the entry of a plea of guilty upon such grounds nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence, and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and this will normally only arise where the accused person did not understand the nature of the charge, or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it: Meissner v R (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 157; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 45-46.  (my emphasis)
68The proposition that, before the Court will go behind a plea of guilty and entertain an appeal against conviction, it must be satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has occurred was emphasised in R v Kouroumalos [2000] NSWCCA 453, per Wood CJ at CL (with Studdert and Whealy JJ agreeing) at [16], citing R v Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 231; and R v O'Sullivan (2002) 128 A Crim R 371 at [9]-[12].
69One circumstance where that may be established is where the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charges.  Another is where the applicant, on the admitted facts, could not in law have been convicted of the offences charged (Liberti at 121-122).  In Kouroumalos at [19], Wood CJ at CL emphasised that what is required is ""the identification of some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt or that otherwise the integrity of the plea is bona fide in question"".
Should guilty plea be set aside? 
70I have referred above to what transpired in relation to Mr Kennedy's guilty plea.  It emerges from the exchanges his Honour had with Mr Kennedy that Mr Kennedy did not understand what was required to be established in order to rely upon an exemption under the RAMA provisions for construction of rural infrastructure, in that he thought he was guilty of the offence of unlawful clearing because he had not used the timber within 18 months, whereas the issue as to whether he could have relied on that exception was whether he had the intention of using the timber for that purpose within the relevant period.
71Although his Honour made clear to Mr Kennedy the distinction between whether at the time the clearing took place he had intended to use the timber for construction purposes within the specified time period, on the one hand, and whether he had in fact used the timber within the specified time period, on the other hand, the fact that there remains some doubt as to whether Mr Kennedy really understood the relevance of that issue raises the question whether his guilty plea was based on a real awareness of guilt.
72The prosecutor accepts that Mr Kennedy may not have fully comprehended the effect of his guilty plea.  However, he submits, first, that his Honour accepted that little turned on the question whether or not the timber cleared was in fact used within the 18 month period contemplated by clause 16(1)(a) of the Native Vegetation Regulation, the exemption relating to the clearing of native vegetation intended (at the time of the clearing activities) for use within that period.
73Second, the prosecutor submits that no miscarriage of justice can have arisen as a result of any outstanding uncertainty on the part of Mr Kennedy as to the extent or effect of his guilty plea.  The prosecutor contends that even if Mr Kennedy had intended (at the relevant time) to use all of the cleared non-regrowth native vegetation for the construction of rural infrastructure within 18 months of the clearing activities, this would not in itself have given him a complete defence to the charge for the two reasons to which his Honour adverted at [73] of his reasons.
74The offence as charged was of clearing within a period of time and not over a specific area.  The prosecutor submits that even at its highest there will always have been some part of the clearing which occurred during that period of time and which was not properly shown to be lawful clearing, i.e., that did not fall within one of the defences.  Accordingly, it is submitted that a finding of guilty, on any contested hearing, would have been inevitable.
75The prosecutor accepts that the area of unlawful clearing would have an impact on sentencing considerations and in particular the level of environmental harm.  It is accepted that if the area unlawfully cleared was quite small there may be a good argument that the environmental harm caused by that clearing was less than that which was found but it is submitted that in the present case all of the clearing which was found to be unlawful clearing was in fact unlawful clearing.
76In circumstances where, for the reasons set out below, the uncertainty on Mr Kennedy's part as to what was comprised by the offence cannot have altered the conclusion that, on the admitted facts, a contravention was established, there is no miscarriage of justice in the fact that his Honour accepted the guilty plea notwithstanding the confusion on Mr Kennedy's part as to what was required to fall within the exemption for clearing for rural infrastructure.
Conviction appeal
77I turn then to the contentions raised by Mr Kennedy on his conviction appeal.  In essence, what Mr Kennedy contends is that the clearing was permitted by various of the exemptions contained in the Native Vegetation Act.
78Sections 21 and 22 in Division 3 of the Act identify clearing which is allowed to be undertaken without a property vegetation plan or other approval.  Relevantly, s 22 contemplates clearing for routine agricultural management activities (RAMA) but does not authorise clearing of native vegetation for those purposes if it exceeds the minimum extent necessary.  The prosecutor notes that in the present case there were no findings about whether clearing for any of the identified RAMA was or was not to the minimum extent necessary (and hence if Mr Kennedy's appeal were to succeed the matter would need to be remitted for re-hearing).
79Mr Kennedy relies on the following matters for his contention that the clearing of native vegetation from his property within the charge period was permitted.
Regrowth
80First, Mr Kennedy contends that a large part of the vegetation cleared was ""regrowth"" within the meaning of s 9 of the Native Vegetation Act.  The prosecutor does not accept that Mr Kennedy established such a defence but notes that this contention was accepted by the primary judge (at [5], [31] and [61]).
81In that respect, the prosecutor notes that the onus, for a party seeking to defend a charge in reliance upon the regrowth exemption under s 19 of the Native Vegetation Act, is on the defendant (Director-General of the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water v Walker Corporation Pty Ltd (No 2) [2011] NSWLEC 229 at [134]).  That requires the defendant to establish on the balance of probabilities the matters set out by Preston CJ of LEC in Walker Corporation (No 2) at [136]-[144], one of which is that the vegetation cleared was ""only regrowth"".  It is submitted by the prosecutor that a finding that a large amount, but not all, of the native vegetation cleared was regrowth would not have established a defence to the charge.
82For that reason, Mr Kennedy's challenge to his conviction based on the cleared timber being regrowth cannot succeed.  His Honour accepted that there was some regrowth but a defence based on this could not have succeeded had the issue been fully argued.
83The prosecutor accepts that his Honour's finding that a large amount of the vegetation was regrowth was relevant to the question of penalty and submits that it was taken into account by his Honour for that purpose at [61] and [72].
Routine agricultural management activities 
84Second, Mr Kennedy contends that the balance of the native vegetation removed by him (found to have comprised approximately 600 mature trees [62]) was: harvested for the purpose of obtaining construction timber for the purposes of s 11(2) of the Native Vegetation Act and clause 16 of the Native Vegetation Regulation; cleared for the purposes of controlling noxious animals (said to be permitted by s 11(1)(c) of the Native Vegetation Act); and/or cleared for the purposes of creating firebreaks.
Clearing for construction purposes 
85As to the use of the timber for RAMA purposes (i.e., for the purpose of construction of rural infrastructure), the prosecutor accepts that Mr Kennedy's response to the question put to him by his Honour on this issue suggests that, from at least June 2010, Mr Kennedy may have intended to use some (if not all) of the timber cleared within the 18 month period.  The prosecutor submits that the evidence does not disclose whether Mr Kennedy had this intention at any earlier time within the charge period when clearing was undertaken on the property.
86However, it is not necessary to determine this (and this is the reason that there is no miscarriage of justice in acceptance of the guilty plea) because Mr Kennedy could not have succeeded in establishing the RAMA defence relating to construction of rural infrastructure in the absence of evidence satisfying clause 16(2)(b) of the Native Vegetation Regulation, which required that the clearing be carried out ""in conjunction with a restoration program or other arrangements that will ensure the restoration of native vegetation on the cleared land of the same or a similar species as the native vegetation cleared and to the same or a similar extent as existed on the cleared land"".
87His Honour found that there was no such program or other arrangement at the time of the clearing ([73]).  The prosecutor points in this regard to the evidence of Mr Kennedy as supporting his Honour's finding.  The prosecutor submits that it is no answer to this for Mr Kennedy to say that a restoration program was unnecessary (as ""regrowth has occurred as a natural process""), since the requirement under the Regulation is that the restoration include ""the same or a similar species ... and to the same or a similar extent as existed on the cleared land"".  The prosecutor further notes that the ""regrowth counts"" referred to by Mr Kennedy in attachment E make no attempt to identify the new regrowth species nor was any attempt made to identify or quantify the species present before the clearing commenced.
88The second reason that the prosecutor contends the RAMA exemption could not have been established is by reference to the finding that part of the cleared vegetation comprised an endangered ecological community ([36]).  It is submitted that this finding was properly available to his Honour on the evidence (referring to the report of Dr Nadolny) and that it takes at least some of Mr Kennedy's clearing beyond the scope of the RAMA rural infrastructure exemption on which he relies (referring to clause 16(3)(a) of the Native Vegetation Regulation).  Again, it is not necessary to determine this because, as noted above, the absence of a restoration program in relation to the clearing makes the RAMA exemption unsustainable.
Noxious animals
89As to the operation of s 11(1)(c) of the Native Vegetation Act, which permits landholders to clear native vegetation for the control of noxious animals under the Rural Lands Protection Act 1998, the prosecutor notes that each of the ways in which clearing may be permitted under the Rural Lands Protection Act requires a positive approval, direction or authorisation (as recognised by the primary judge at [18]). The prosecutor notes that it was an agreed fact that the clearing was not undertaken in accordance with any such approval direction or authorisation (referring to [17] and [18] of the Statement of Agreed Facts).
90Again the evidence does not support the conclusion that the clearing was permitted within this exemption.
Firebreaks 
91As to the submission made in relation to the community safety in the creation of firebreaks, the prosecutor notes that the combined operation of the Native Vegetation Act and Native Vegetation Regulation does not create an exemption for the purpose of creating firebreaks (as noted by his Honour at [63]).  Nor was the clearing authorised to be carried out under the Rural Fires Act in relation to any emergency fire fighting act as defined by that Act; or in accordance with a Bushfire Management Plan under that Act, or under any other direction authorising or permitting the clearing of native vegetation on the property was issued by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (reference being made to [16] of the Statement of Agreed Facts).
92There was no error by his Honour in that conclusion.
93The prosecutor further submits that there was no evidence to suggest that the firebreaks might reasonably have been considered necessary to remove or reduce an imminent risk of the type contemplated by s 11(1)(i) of the Native Vegetation Act.  The concept of ""imminent risk"" for the purposes of this exemption was considered by Pepper J in Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Rummery [2012] NSWLEC 271 (affirmed by this Court in Rummery v Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage [2014] NSWCCA 106).  It requires an assessment of the objective risk of harm and a temporal nexus between the vegetation and the risk posed by the vegetation; in other words that the risk was to be assessed against the likelihood of injury occurring relatively soon and not at some inchoate point in time ([57]).  There was no evidence to suggest that there was an imminent risk of injury requiring the clearance of particular areas of the property by way of firebreaks.
Necessity of a restoration program
94As to the contention (in ground 4) that regrowth had occurred as a natural process and hence that a restoration program was not required, if this is relied upon for an argument that the RAMA exemption for infrastructure construction could be invoked without the need for a restoration program, I have already explained why that does not follow.  If the regrowth since clearing is relied upon as indicating the earlier absence of an endangered ecological community, it suffers from the lack of any evidence to indicate the likely rate of regrowth of such a community.
95The absence of an endangered ecological community at the time of clearing would go to the degree of environmental harm; a matter relevant in relation to sentencing.  However, it is clear that attachments E and A were not before his Honour so there can have been no error in his Honour not having regard to subsequent regrowth analyses when accepting the expert evidence that was before him on that issue and when considering the objective seriousness of the offence for sentencing purposes.
Attachment F - the polygon analysis
96Finally, Mr Kennedy contends that his Honour did not address the submissions he had made as to there being incorrect areas included in the polygon analysis carried out by Mr Spiers (attachment F).  The dispute as to the polygon analysis at the hearing was as to the description of the land in various of the polygons and whether the area cleared was regrowth, in the context of Mr Kennedy's submissions at trial that there was an area exempt under RAMA provisions of 19.505 hectares. 
97Mr Spiers had interpreted the aerial photographs and had described areas by reference, among other things, to different colours or colour gradations.  Attachment F, at least in part, appears to represent Mr Kennedy's submissions as to Mr Spiers' conclusions and as to why the descriptions given by Mr Spiers should be seen as consistent with clearing having occurred at an earlier time.  Mr Kennedy informed his Honour at the hearing that he had estimated the percentages of the areas within the polygons that he believed had already been cleared and were not timbered.  The thrust of Mr Kennedy's submission, as his Honour noted, was that Mr Spiers had not sufficiently taken into account the areas that Mr Kennedy said were regrowth.  Mr Spiers was not cross-examined on his report at the hearing.
98While his Honour did not refer expressly in his reasons to the ""Final Submissions"" document (Attachment F), his Honour clearly adverted to the dispute as to the area of clearing (at [63] of his reasons) and to Mr Cotter's analysis (at [59]).  Further, his Honour accepted in Mr Kennedy's favour that the balance of clearing (other than the mature trees and the permissible buffer areas) was non-protected regrowth.  The prosecutor had contended that photographic evidence showing logs on the area referred to as polygon 165 was inconsistent with the proposition that all that was cleared in that particular area was non-protected regrowth.
99The primary judge did not err in accepting the unchallenged expert evidence of Mr Spiers as to the interpretation to be placed on the aerial photographs.  Moreover, his Honour's acceptance of Mr Cotter's conclusion that a substantial belt of native vegetation was retained on the property, and of Mr Cotter's view that, at least substantially, the vegetation cleared from polygon 165 was regrowth [59], was in Mr Kennedy's favour when his Honour came to assess the level of environmental harm that had been occasioned by the clearing.
100Therefore, the complaint made by Mr Kennedy as to his Honour's acceptance of Mr Spiers' evidence does not establish that the conviction based on acceptance of Mr Kennedy's guilty plea was unsound.
Conclusion on conviction appeal
101The prosecutor contends that this was not a case where the trial judge simply relied on the guilty plea as establishing the elements of the offence; rather that there was evidence that justified the finding and there was an exploration of the defences that Mr Kennedy now raises.  It is submitted that a finding of guilt, even had there been a not guilty plea, would have been inevitable.  I agree.
102Further, it is submitted that, having regard to the fact that his Honour accepted that Mr Kennedy believed he was allowed to clear some of this vegetation but was in part mistaken, the issue was properly addressed on the question of sentence as a subjective mitigating factor.  Again, I agree.
103Therefore, while there was doubt as to whether Mr Kennedy fully understood the basis on which he could not rely on the RAMA exemption for construction of rural infrastructure (mistakenly thinking it was because he had not in fact used the timber within the 18 month period), no miscarriage of justice occurred because the exemption was not available to him in any event since the clearing was not in accordance with a restoration program (and would also not have been available if, as the prosecution evidence demonstrated, the cleared area had included an endangered ecological community).  The appeal from conviction must be dismissed.
The sentence appeal
104As to the appeal from the sentence imposed, Mr Kennedy raises a number of issues by reference to which he contends that his Honour erred in relation to the imposition of the penalty.  However, as is clear from his Honour's reasons, in determining the appropriate penalty his Honour took into account each of the matters raised by Mr Kennedy on appeal.
105In a number of instances his Honour did so favourably to Mr Kennedy.  For example, his Honour accepted (at [61]) that a large portion of the cleared area comprised regrowth; accepted Mr Kennedy's contentions as to the number of mature trees that had been logged ([61]); and accepted that Mr Kennedy genuinely, but mistakenly, believed that the clearing fell within statutory defences or exemptions ([72]).  His Honour accepted Mr Kennedy's evidence as to the eradication of noxious animals and his submissions as to the matters referred to in relation to the remediation of the property ([76]).
106While his Honour considered that the area cleared was of some significance, his Honour noted that this was not determinative of the objective seriousness of the offence ([47]).  His Honour evaluated the level of environmental harm caused by the clearing as being of moderate objective gravity.  That conclusion has not been shown to be affected by a failure to take into account relevant matters or by account being taken of irrelevant matters and it is not a conclusion that could be said to reflect some error of principle.
107In oral submissions on the appeal, Mr Kennedy emphasised that his property had been extensively disturbed over a long period and had a severe noxious animal infestation and submitted that the area cleared was regrowth and that there was no endangered ecological community on the property.  Those matters were taken into account by his Honour in Mr Kennedy's favour.
108Mr Kennedy emphasised on the appeal that, as the owner of a property, he had a legal responsibility under Occupational Health and Safety provisions to provide a safe workplace and said that, prior to removing the regrowth, the area was entangled with remains of logging, had low cut stumps not clearly visible and extensive areas of rabbit warrens comprising a very unsafe workplace.  It is not clear that submissions of that kind based on the existence of OHS obligations were put to the primary judge but in any event if there were competing obligations under the OHS legislation that would not authorise a breach of the Native Vegetation Act.
109Mr Kennedy submits that he has complied with any remediation orders on the property and fencing at a cost of over $50,000.  He also submits that, prior to removing regrowth and addressing the issue of noxious animals and fire risk, he was physically unable to access these areas of the property for mustering, weed spraying and property management activities (since, due to work injuries, he is only able to use a four wheeled bike for access and management).  Mr Kennedy submits that no landholder should be denied access to his or her own property.  The remediation of the property was a matter which his Honour took into account.  As to limitations on use (prior to clearing) of the property due to Mr Kennedy's injuries, I accept that from Mr Kennedy's perspective such limitations would be unfortunate.  However, they do not authorise a breach of the legislation in relation to clearance of native vegetation.
110On the whole, as I read his Honour's decision, the findings on sentence were favourable to Mr Kennedy.  No basis has been demonstrated for any conclusion that his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion as to the imposition of sentence consequent upon acceptance of the guilty plea and the entry of a conviction against Mr Kennedy.
Conclusion
111For the reasons above, I would dismiss the appeal from both conviction and sentence.
112JOHNSON J:  I agree with Ward JA.
113R S HULME AJ:  I agree with Ward JA.

		18 June 2014",2014-06-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764150,"Rummery v Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage [2014] NSWCCA 106","Judgment

1WARD JA: Mr Rummery pleaded guilty to, and was convicted on 20 December 2012 by the Land and Environment Court of, an offence against s 12(1) of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (NSW). The offence, as charged in the prosecutor's summons filed 9 November 2011, was that: between about 13 August 2008 and 17 August 2010, at or near Bendemeer in the State of New South Wales, Mr Rummery cleared native vegetation otherwise than in accordance with a development consent granted in accordance with the Native Vegetation Act or a property vegetation plan.

2The summons particularised the place of the offence as being at or near the property ""Yarragool"" in Bendemeer (including reference to particular lot numbers) and the native vegetation alleged to have been unlawfully cleared as including nine particular species of vegetation. The manner of breach was particularised as being by use of a bulldozer and/or pesticide/herbicide application equipment (sub-para (c)(a)) and/or that Mr Rummery was the landholder of the land on which the clearing of native vegetation was carried out (sub-para (c)(b)).

3The particulars of the offence specified the date on which evidence of the offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer as being 12 November 2009 (the officer in question being identified as Mr Greg Roberts). The particulars did not identify the actual area of land cleared during the relevant period.

4On 9 March 2012, at which time Mr Rummery had the benefit of legal representation, Mr Rummery pleaded guilty to the charge. The matter was listed for hearing before Pepper J in the Land and Environment Court in October 2012, at which time Mr Rummery represented himself. On 20 December 2012, her Honour published her reasons for convicting Mr Rummery of the offence as charged and as to the penalty to be imposed ([2012] NSWLEC 271). Mr Rummery was fined the sum of $80,040 and, pursuant to ss 257B and 257G of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), was ordered to pay the prosecutor's costs of the proceedings.

5Mr Rummery now appeals from both his conviction and sentence. Pursuant to s 5AB, read with s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), his appeal is as of right. It is an appeal in the strict sense, requiring that error be shown on the part of the primary judge (per Santow JA in Gilmour v Environment Protection Authority [2002] NSWCCA 399; (2002) 55 NSWLR 593 at [15], [19]; Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Director General, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water [2012] NSWCCA 210; (2012) 82 NSWLR 12 at [43]).

Background

6The history of the Yarragool property taken into account by her Honour is set out in two statements of agreed facts and in Mr Rummery's affidavit of 17 August 2012. Briefly, that history includes the following matters.

7Around 1929, almost all the trees on the property were ringbarked. In the 1950's, the majority of the property was cleared by logging but vegetation in the south-eastern and very northern section of the property was retained. Selective hardwood saw logging occurred on the property from the 1950's through to 1989. During part of that time, the logging was by the Bendemeer Sawmill.

8Mr Rummery's father purchased the property in 1974. It had previously been owned by Mr John Thrift's family. Mr Thrift recalled that the northern area of the property was pretty much totally bare with the exception of a few trees and rocky outcrops and that a section of the southern side of the property was affected by beetles in the 1980's and had been ""virtually chopped ... all out"".

9Between 1974 and 2004, Mr Rummery's father owned and managed the property. He ran a fine wool enterprise on the property as well as beef cattle. In 1984, Mr Rummery's brother logged areas on the property that had previously been logged in the 1950's as well as areas that had not been logged before in the southern area of the property. In 1985, vegetation was completely removed from the walls of three dams that had been built in 1983. In 1989, Mr Rummery's brother re-logged areas that had been cut by the Bendemeer Sawmill in the late 1970's. In the years 1988-1991, Mr Rummery's father employed a team to poison timber on the property. In some areas, the poisoning resulted in new regrowth timber growing more thickly than before; in other areas, regrowth was controlled through the presence of livestock.

10Farm management across the property was based around three management zones. Zone one, at the northern part of the property, was subdivided with new fencing in the 1970's and contained a set of sheep yards. Mr Rummery's evidence was that regrowth trees in that area were controlled with herbicide from 1988-1991. Zone 2 was the central area used for livestock management and was described as generally open grazing country. Mr Rummery said this required only limited vegetation management which was undertaken mechanically with a tractor and blade or a bulldozer. Zone 3, referred to as the Back Paddocks, was rougher terrain with two long mountain ranges and a valley in between. Mr Rummery said that regrowth vegetation in the valley was controlled with herbicide for the period 1988-1991. 

11From 1996, Mr Rummery's father leased the property to various people to run livestock and the overall condition of the property declined. Mr Rummery and his wife purchased the property in 2004. They prepared a farm management plan. It was agreed that this did not constitute a development consent nor was it a property vegetation plan for the purposes of the Native Vegetation Act. Since purchasing the property, Mr and Mrs Rummery have developed the property, including carrying out clearing in accordance with that plan.

12In April 2008, two authorised officers of the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (DECCW), Mr Stephen Beaman and Mr Glendon Turner, observed evidence of clearing of the Yarragool property from the fenceline of the property (at Airlie Road) for about 1 kilometre in an easterly direction. The Supplementary Statement of Agreed Facts recorded that Mr Turner considered the small stacks of pushed vegetation to be regrowth and that Mr Beaman did not consider the clearing to be particularly significant.

13On 12 November 2009, Mr Greg Roberts (an authorised officer under s 34 of the Native Vegetation Act) took aerial photographs or images of the Yarragool property. This is the date specified in the summons as the date on which evidence of the offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer for the purposes of s 42(4) of the Native Vegetation Act. What led to the taking of those photographs was not part of the agreed facts and is relevant when considering the allegation now made by Mr Rummery that the claim against him may have been statute barred. I refer to Mr Rummery's contentions in that regard in due course (at [84]ff below). For present purposes, I simply note that there is a dispute as to when the clearing the subject of the charge to which Mr Rummery pleaded guilty first came to the attention of an authorised officer under the Native Vegetation Act.

14After the aerial inspection on 12 November 2009, officers from the Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) undertook a number of site investigations of the property: the first, over 11 and 12 May 2010; the second on 13 October 2010, and the third on 29 June 2011. On each occasion this was pursuant to an authority issued under s 35 of the Native Vegetation Act. Aerial photographs were again taken on 17 August 2010. Interviews were held with each of Mr and Mrs Rummery in June 2010 and July 2011. The summons was subsequently filed on 9 November 2011.

Relevant statutory provisions

15Section 12 of the Native Vegetation Act provides as follows:

12 Clearing requiring approval 

(1) Native vegetation must not be cleared except in accordance with: 

(a) a development consent granted in accordance with this Act, or 

(b) a property vegetation plan. 

(2) A person who carries out or authorises the carrying out of clearing in contravention of this section is guilty of an offence and is liable to the maximum penalty provided for under section 126 of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW)] for a contravention of that Act.

(3) It is a defence in any proceedings for an offence against this section if it is established that the clearing was permitted under Division 2 or 3 or was excluded from this Act by Division 4.

16""Native vegetation"" is defined in s 6(1) of the Native Vegetation Act as meaning any of the types of indigenous vegetation there specified (including trees and understorey plants). Section 6(2) provides that vegetation is ""indigenous"" if it is a, or comprises, species of vegetation that existed in the State before European settlement.

17Section 7 provides that ""clearing"" native vegetation means any one or more of a number of activities including cutting down, felling, thinning, logging or removing native vegetation.

18Section 9 deals with what is meant by ""remnant native vegetation"" and ""regrowth"":

9 Meanings of remnant native vegetation and regrowth

(1) For the purposes of this Act, remnant native vegetation means any native vegetation other than regrowth.

(2) For the purposes of this Act, regrowth means any native vegetation that has regrown since ...:
(a) ... 1 January 1990 [in the case of the present land] ...

19Subject to any exclusion in a property vegetation plan, s 19 of the Native Vegetation Act permits the clearing of native vegetation that is ""only regrowth"" (but not ""protected regrowth"" as defined in s 10).

20Section 22, in Division 3 of the Native Vegetation Act, permits clearing for routine agricultural management activities in the following terms:

22 Routine agriculture management activities 

(1) Clearing for routine agricultural management activities is permitted.

(2) This section does not authorise any clearing of native vegetation: 

(a) if it exceeds the minimum extent necessary for carrying out the activity, or 

(b) if it is done for a work, building or structure before the grant of any statutory approval or other authority required for the work, building or structure.

21Section 11 defines routine agricultural management activities as meaning various activities on land carried out by or on behalf of the landowner, including: (a) the construction, operation and maintenance of rural infrastructure including, among other specified infrastructure and subject to the regulations, dams, permanent fences, buildings and farm roads; (b)-(c) the removal of noxious weeds or control of noxious pests, in each case under the relevant legislation; and:

(i) any activity reasonably considered necessary to remove or reduce an imminent risk of serious personal injury or damage to property.

22Section 11(2) provides that the regulations may make provision for or with respect to extending, limiting or varying the activities that are routine agricultural management activities. Part 4 of the Native Vegetation Regulation 2005 (NSW) deals with routine agricultural management activities and, relevantly, regulation 16 provides as follows:

16 Obtaining construction timber

(1) The activities that comprise routine agricultural management activities for the purposes of section 11 of the Act are extended to include the clearing of native vegetation on land for use in the construction or maintenance of rural infrastructure on the land within whichever of the following time periods is applicable to the land:

(a) [relevantly for present purposes] 18 months after the clearing for land ...

(2) This clause authorises clearing of native vegetation only if the clearing:
...
(b) is carried out in conjunction with a restoration program or other arrangements that will ensure the restoration of native vegetation on the cleared land of the same or a similar species as the native vegetation cleared and to the same or a similar extent as existed on the cleared land.

(3) This clause authorises the clearing of native vegetation only if the native vegetation does not comprise:

(a) a threatened species, or a component of a threatened population or threatened ecological community, under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 or is likely to comprise habitat of such a threatened species, ...

23Pursuant to s 42(3) of the Native Vegetation Act, proceedings for an offence under the Act or regulations may be commenced within, but not later than, 2 years after the date on which the offence is alleged to have been committed. However, proceedings for any such offence may also be commenced within, but not later than, 2 years after the date on which evidence of the alleged offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer (s 42(4)). Sub-section (5) provides that if sub-s (4) is relied on for the purpose of commencing proceedings for an offence (as was the case here) the information or application must contain particulars of the date on which evidence of the offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer and need not contain particulars of the date on which the offence was committed. In such a case, sub-s (5) provides that the date on which evidence first came to the attention of an authorised officer is the date specified in the information or application, unless the contrary is established.

24The objects of the legislation are set out in s 3 and include to provide for, encourage and promote the management of native vegetation on a regional basis in the social, economic and environmental interests of the State (sub-s (a)).

Hearing in the Land and Environment Court

25In the Land and Environment Court hearing, the prosecutor's case was that Mr Rummery had cleared 286ha of native vegetation from the property during the charge period (between 13 August 2008 and 17 August 2010), of which 248ha had been unlawfully cleared. (The prosecutor accepted that 38ha of the vegetation cleared by Mr Rummery over the charge period had been lawfully removed for the purposes of Mr Rummery constructing rural infrastructure.) The prosecutor relied upon an expert ecologist report for the contention that 30,000 to 50,000 trees had been cleared, comprising mainly trees that were 80 years' old, and that there was present on the cleared area an ecological community of high value.

26The prosecutor's evidence included expert opinion evidence based on aerial photograph interpretation (from Mr Paul Spiers) expert ecological evidence (from Dr Chris Nadolny) and expert evidence as to threatened species (Dr Todd Soderquist) based on the site visits referred to above and vegetation sampling on a travelling stock route (which was Crown owned land) in the area. There was also evidence obtained in a recorded interview of Mr Rummery (under caution) and written answers to questions put to Mr Rummery.

27During their site visits, OEH investigators and ecologists visited approximately 110ha of the alleged unlawfully cleared 248ha, collected specimens of some cleared vegetation for later identification, took measurements of the breast height diameter (DBH) of some cleared and uncleared vegetation, and undertook on-property identification of some vegetation. Global Positioning System technology was used to identify where on the property the samples were collected and recorded.

28It was contended that the clearing had caused significant or substantial environmental harm.

29Mr Rummery's position, maintained both in opening and closing submissions at the Land and Environment Court hearing, was that he had pleaded guilty to illegal clearing only on 48ha of the property and that he did not agree that the area he had illegally cleared was 248ha. He disputed not only the area of illegal clearing but also: the number of trees that had been cleared; whether the cleared vegetation was proved to have been native indigenous vegetation; the age of the cleared timber; whether it had been proved that the cleared trees did not constitute regrowth; whether the trees were dead or alive when cleared; and whether there was evidence of an endangered ecological community having been present or of any impact on threatened fauna. Mr Rummery placed weight on the fact that the OEH ecologists had not visited a substantial portion (approximately 130ha) of the allegedly cleared area and had made estimates on the basis, among other things, of investigations of vegetation on Crown land some distance away that was a travelling stock route. Mr Rummery disputed the level of environmental harm claimed by the prosecutor.

30Mr Rummery gave evidence at the Land and Environment Court hearing as to his awareness of the requirements of the Native Vegetation Act; claimed that he had undertaken the clearing under the exception contained in s 11(1)(i) of that Act (due to the risk posed by vegetation to the safety of workers when mustering on the property); acknowledged that he did not seek advice from the consent authority regarding the clearing but relied on information sheets on the Native Vegetation Act issued by the Catchment Management Authority; and contended that he was in an impossible position having to meet his legal obligations under both the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW) (OHS Act) and the Native Vegetation Act if the exception under s 11(1)(i) did not apply. On this last point, Mr Rummery noted that clearing specifically for safety reasons was not a basis on which approval for a property vegetation plan would be given and that such a plan could not be approved unless it improved or maintained environmental outcomes (referring to s 29 of the Native Vegetation Act).

31Mr Rummery contended that the level of environmental harm by his activities was low, based on the limited area that he admitted having unlawfully cleared and his evidence that, in undertaking the clearing, he had actively sought to minimise the level of environmental harm by identifying and clearing small trees without habitat hollows and of relatively low environmental value; had not cleared environmentally sensitive riparian areas; and had cleared slowly to allow impacted fauna to relocate.

32Mr Rummery adduced evidence of good character and his financial inability to pay a fine; expressed his remorse and stated that he did not set out deliberately to breach the Native Vegetation Act; referred to his co-operation with the investigators and the prosecutor throughout the investigation and prior to the hearing and that he had undertaken the clearing without concealment or removing evidence. Reference was made to the Supplementary Statement of Agreed Facts in this regard.

33The prosecutor accepts that in the Land and Environment Court proceedings, Mr Rummery raised the matters set out at [9]-[20] of his submissions dated 5 September 2013 filed on the present appeal (broadly summarised above). In essence, in the proceedings before her Honour and on the present appeal, Mr Rummery contended that the prosecutor was not able to prove beyond reasonable doubt what he contended were the basic elements of the charge, including in this regard that the prosecutor had not proved that the cleared trees did not constitute regrowth. He nevertheless maintains that he did not rely on ""regrowth"" as an exception to s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act but, rather, as a mitigating factor when assessing the question of environmental harm.

Primary judgment

34Her Honour noted (at [21]) that the clearing the subject of the charge was undertaken using a single bulldozer and that Mr Rummery had estimated that he had cleared vegetation approximately 3 days per week over the charge period at a rate of approximately 1ha per day. Her Honour noted that Mr Rummery had cleared vegetation along fencelines, tracks and dams to the extent permitted under the Native Vegetation Act and had cleared an additional 30m along fences and tracks to provide mustering routes ([22]). Her Honour noted that the remainder of the land the subject of the offence was thinned or partially cleared with rough or rocky areas generally conserved; paddock trees retained in most areas; and greater numbers of trees retained in the northern section of the property ([22]).

35At [23]-[25], her Honour noted the predominant species of the cleared trees; the disturbance to native groundcover, mid-storey shrubs and juvenile eucalypts by use of the bulldozer; and the disputed expert ecological evidence that the cleared area may also have comprised a particular endangered ecological community listed under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW) (referred to as Box Gum Woodland).

36Her Honour noted that Mr Rummery contended that he had cleared 200ha of the land subject to two exemptions contained in s 11(1) of the Native Vegetation Act ([38]), the exemption for routine agricultural management activities (i.e., the ""rural infrastructure RAMA"" exemption in sub-s (1)(a)) and the exemption in sub-s (1)(i) (i.e., the ""imminent risk"" exemption).

37Her Honour accepted (at [44]) that the total area of lawfully cleared land pursuant to the rural infrastructure RAMA exemption was, on the balance of probabilities, 47ha. Her Honour thus concluded (at [46]) that the total area of unlawfully cleared land the subject of the charge was to be reduced to 239ha. Because Mr Rummery had agreed that he had unlawfully cleared 48ha of native vegetation, her Honour noted that this left an area of 191ha in dispute ([46]).

38Her Honour did not accept that the remaining 191ha had been lawfully cleared pursuant to the imminent risk exemption ([55]). Her Honour accepted that mustering was undeniably an inherently dangerous activity but said that this did not of itself mean that mustering involved an ""imminent risk"" for the purposes of s 11(1)(i). Her Honour concluded that the phrase ""imminent risk"" involved a temporal nexus; i.e., that the risk must be assessed against the likelihood of serious personal injury occurring relatively soon and not at some inchoate point in time ([57]).

39Her Honour considered that none of the native vegetation cleared had posed an ""imminent risk of serious personal injury"" and that, at its highest, the risks posed by vegetation in the mustering undertaken by Mr Rummery were better classified as potential or latent risks ([61]; [71]). Her Honour concluded that the total area the subject of the unlawful clearing was thus 239ha ([72]).

40Turning to the environmental harm caused by the unlawful clearing, her Honour noted the dispute as to the calculation of the number of trees felled by Mr Rummery ([77]-[78]). Her Honour was not able to find that the prosecutor had demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that the figures of its expert ecologist (Dr Nadolny) should be accepted ([80]), given that his estimate was given ""very roughly"" and it failed to take into account the area of land permissibly cleared pursuant to the rural infrastructure RAMA exemption ([79]). Expressly giving Mr Rummery the benefit of the doubt, her Honour found that between 18,000-20,000 trees were cleared by him during the charge period ([85]). Her Honour considered that the nature of the clearing could only be classified as extensive having regard to the fact that it resulted in ""the near total removal (apart from the retention of isolated patches of vegetation and larger trees) of forest and woodland vegetation, and the degradation of native groundcover, from an area covering 239ha of the 2,000ha property"" ([87]).

41As to the age of the trees that had been felled, her Honour considered that at the highest the evidence revealed that the majority were between 40-80 years old (which diminished the objective seriousness of the offence but only marginally) ([101]-[102]). Her Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Box Gum Woodland endangered ecological community (EEC) was present on the property and was adversely impacted by the commission of the offence ([105]) but was unable to make a finding as to the extent of the impact of the unlawful clearing on the EEC ([106]). Her Honour concluded that there was a real likelihood that fauna dependent on the type of woodland habitat that was cleared was present and that the potential adverse impacts of the unlawful clearing on this fauna should be taken into account ([111]).

42Her Honour noted that the experts agreed that in the long term the deleterious environmental consequences of the clearing could be alleviated and that Box Gum Woodland EEC could still be present in low or moderate form in the cleared area and could recover ([112]-[114]).

43Her Honour concluded that the commission of the offence had caused moderate to substantial environmental harm, although not as substantial as the prosecutor had posited, and accepted that harm was to be considered as an aggravating factor ([120]).

44As to Mr Rummery's state of mind, relevant to the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence, her Honour considered that Mr Rummery's actions were undertaken negligently (he having erroneously relied upon the imminent risk exemption to undertake clearing over a wide area and not having sought any advice as to the lawfulness of the clearing) ([129]). Her Honour did not accept that his actions were undertaken in reckless disregard of the provisions of the Native Vegetation Act. Rather, her Honour accepted that Mr Rummery undertook the clearing based on a genuine misunderstanding that the activity came within a statutory exception ([130]).

45As to Mr Rummery's reasons for the activity, her Honour found that there were several reasons, only one of which was the provision of a safe working environment; the clearing having been generally effected in order to develop the property in accordance with the farm management plan. ([140]). Her Honour did not find that the clearing was undertaken for commercial gain ([141]).

46Having regard to those matters, as well as Mr Rummery's acknowledgment that the risk of harm to the environment from the unlawful clearing was at all times reasonably foreseeable; the fact that there were practicable measures available to prevent the risk of harm (such as applying for a development consent or property vegetation plan and seeking advice); and the fact that Mr Rummery had full control over the causes of the offence, her Honour concluded that the offence was one of moderate to serious objective gravity ([142]-[145]).

47Her Honour then turned to the question of personal or mitigating factors, noting that Mr Rummery did not have any prior convictions for any environmental offences ([148]); had presented a number of affidavits as to his good character and contribution to the local community ([149]); had entered a plea of guilty at the second mention of the matter (as a result of which her Honour said that he was entitled to the full 25% discount, notwithstanding that the utilitarian value of the plea was affected to the extent that he had contested a number of issues) ([150]-[153]); that he had demonstrated genuine contrition and remorse, had not attempted to conceal the offence and had cooperated with the authorities ([157]-[160]); and was unlikely to re-offend ([161]).

48Her Honour also referred to the evidence relied upon by Mr Rummery as to the financial consequences of imposition of a penalty (including his evidence that he could no longer afford legal representation and that even the imposition of a modest penalty would have financial implications for himself and his family, and his ability to retain the property) ([163]); as well as evidence from Mr Rummery's accountant, bank manager and father-in-law ([164]). Her Honour said that the evidence did not unequivocally disclose whether Mr Rummery's primary place of residence was Yarragool but that it did reveal that Mr Rummery owned at least two properties, the value of each of which was unknown ([167]). Her Honour was unable to conclude that the imposition of more than a nominal fine, though accepting that it would cause a degree of financial distress, would result in the forced sale of Mr Rummery's primary residence or, if his two properties be separate, of Yarragool ([168]).

49Her Honour concluded (at [169]) that the subjective circumstances operated to mitigate to a considerable degree the penalty that would otherwise be imposed by the Court.

50Having regard to those matters, and to the need for general deterrence and consistency in sentencing, her Honour concluded that the appropriate penalty was $120,000 ([193]). That penalty was then discounted by 33% to $80,040. Her Honour indicated that but for Mr Rummery's financial circumstances the fine would have been considerably higher given the objective gravity of the offence. Her Honour said that there was no disentitling conduct by the prosecutor that would justify an order that each party bear its own costs and ordered that Mr Rummery bear the prosecutor's costs noting that the payment of those costs (which were likely to be considerable) was taken into account in setting the appropriate fine ([191]-[192]).

Appeal

51In his notice of appeal filed on 9 September 2013, Mr Rummery raises the following five grounds of appeal:

1. The judge erred in failing to understand the requirements and gravity of the legal obligations and responsibilities placed on the Defendant under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (OHS Act) (now repealed) which placed an absolute duty on an employer to ensure the health and safety of workers in the workplace. The judge further erred in failing to recognise that it was not possible for the Defendant to meet the legal obligations of the OHS Act 2000 without breaching the Native Vegetation Act 2003 if the exception of s 11(1)(i) is not accepted.

2. The judge erred in failing to understand that the Defendant only pleaded guilty to 48 hectares (ha) of illegal clearing (an offence under s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003). The judge further erred in accepting the proposition made by the Crown that Routine Agricultural Management Activities are the only reasons why clearing would not contravene s 12 of the NV Act [Transcript 23/10/12 page 3, paras 25-43 AB4 Tab 54]. The judge was in error in not putting the evidence of the Crown on clearing 248 ha to the test of proof under the Native Vegetation Act 2003 s 6(1)(a), s6(2), s 7(a)(b), s 9(2)(a) before examining the validity of any claimed exceptions.

3. The judge cannot support the finding she made on the 'level of harm' caused by the clearing based on the lack of evidence put before the court by the Crown witnesses for the area of unlawful clearing.

4. The judge failed to fully understand that the Defendant had absolutely no capacity to pay a fine. The judge failed to take into consideration the impact the legal and expert witness costs that the Defendant incurred to show the Crown case was inaccurate, overstated and substantially based on unfounded opinion and assumptions rather than any evidence that could be proven beyond reasonable doubt. The judge erred in not recognising the lack of profitability in a grazing business and the extreme and long term financial consequences for the Defendant's dependant family including the real possibility of having to sell the family home and farm business, by imposing a significant financial penalty.

5. The Appellant claims that at least part of the charge may be statute barred under s42(4) of the Native Vegetation Act 2003. This was unable to be examined in the trial court as the Prosecutor refused to produce some documents under a Notice to Produce, provided false information to the Defendant prior to a plea being entered and then filed a relevant affidavit 3 days prior to the hearing date, (11 months after the summons was filed), that contradicted previous information provided to the Defendant. The Defendant was self represented and was unable to process this information in sufficient detail to raise the issue in court

Application to tender further evidence

52Relevant to the fourth and fifth grounds of appeal, is Mr Rummery's application to rely on further evidence as to various matters: the date on which evidence of the clearing first came to the attention of an authorised officer; the unlikelihood or inability of Mr Rummery to have been permitted to clear the area under a property vegetation plan having regard to OEH guidelines; and the financial impact of the fine on Mr Rummery. Volume 5 of the Appeal Books contained most of that additional evidence.

53As to the first of those three matters (the date on which evidence of the clearing first came to an authorised officer's attention), Mr Rummery sought to tender two affidavits that had been filed but not read in the proceedings below (an affidavit affirmed 31 January 2012 of Mr Roberts and an affidavit affirmed 18 October 2012 of Mr Beaman); a letter dated 3 March 2012 from a legal officer with OEH (Ms Rebecca Hicks). Mr Rummery also sought to rely upon material produced at the commencement of the hearing by the prosecutor in answer to an order for production that had been made, on Mr Rummery's application, on 7 February 2014 shortly before the hearing of the appeal.

54The 7 February 2014 order for production required production of documents falling within three categories of documents. The Court was informed by Mr Muston, Counsel for the prosecutor, that there had previously been informal production of documents falling within those categories (1, 4 and 7 of the order). Formally produced in Court in answer to the order for production was a folder of documents. The prosecutor's solicitor, Mr Fox, was cross-examined by Mr Rummery in relation to the production (to which I will refer in due course).

55Paragraph 1 of the order for production called for the hard copy satellite image of the Yarragool property referred to in Mr Roberts' 31 January 2012 affidavit ""and used by him to confirm his location when flying over the property on 12 November 2009"". Produced in answer to this was a coloured image bearing the identifying reference ""NWA09 012"". Mr Fox gave evidence that he had made enquiries within the department in an attempt to locate the image referred to in paragraph 1 of the order to produce and that he was instructed that the image that had been produced ""was likely to be"" the image that was called for in that paragraph (T 6.23). Mr Fox also said that he had made enquiries as to, but had been unable to determine, the date on which that particular image was taken. Mr Fox did not know the source of the image. He referred to enquiries that had been made of Mr Roberts (who had retired some time ago) at an earlier stage in order to locate the particular image to which Mr Roberts had referred in his affidavit.

56Paragraph 4 of the order for production called for production of the ""07/08 SLATS [Statewide Landcover and Tree Survey] image"" of the Yarragool property, including any ""supporting data on the area of vegetation change"", referred to in Mr Beaman's 18 October 2012 affidavit. What was produced in answer to that paragraph was a ""thumb drive"", which the Court was informed contained a vast electronic file requiring particular software for it to be viewed (and which I have not attempted to review).

57Paragraph 5 of the order for production called for production of ""[a]ll remotely sensed images (hard copy or electronic aerial photographs and satellite images)"" of the property captured on or after 13 August 2008 and viewed or accessed by authorised officers prior to 12 November 2009.

58Mr Fox gave evidence that what was produced in answer to this paragraph was a CD containing a digital file being an image that was taken on 13 August 2008, which was viewed and/or accessed by the authorised officers in relation to the investigation prior to 12 November 2009. Also produced was a hard copy of the image labelled ""SPOT Image"".

59As to the second matter (ability to obtain a property vegetation plan for clearance of the land for safety reasons), Mr Rummery sought to tender an affidavit affirmed 10 April 2012 from an OEH Natural Resources Officer (Mr Craig Wood) as to his assessment of whether a property vegetation plan could have been issued for areas of identified clearing on the Yarragool property (which affidavit had also been filed in the proceedings below but not read) and a copy of the OEH's published Environmental Outcomes Assessment Methodology pursuant to the Native Vegetation Regulation 2013 (NSW).

60As to the third matter (ability to pay the fine), Mr Rummery sought to tender Notices of Assessment issued by the ATO for the years ended 30 June 2009, 2011 and 2012 as well as an estimate prepared by him of his weekly income and expenditure for 2013/2014.

61In Mickelberg v R [1989] HCA 35 at [27]; (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 273, Mason CJ considered the appropriate test to be applied by an appellate court in deciding whether to set aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence and said:

... It is established that the proper question is whether the court considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before it at the trial. This test was endorsed by four of the five Justices in Gallagher v The Queen. Deane J and I (at 402) considered that the test was best expressed in those terms. (footnotes omitted) [There referring to Gallagher v R [1986] HCA 26; (1986) 160 CLR 392]

62In R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 (at [63]), it was said that material available at the time of the trial could not properly be characterised as ""fresh evidence"".

63Turning to the categories of fresh evidence here sought to be adduced, there is no suggestion that any of the affidavit material on which Mr Rummery now seeks to rely was not served on him prior to the Land and Environment Court hearing. Mr Rummery complains that he had only had a few days to consider Mr Beaman's 18 October affidavit before the hearing commenced on 20 October 2012. Nevertheless it had been served on him in advance of the hearing and he must have appreciated that it was provided in order to respond to the issues that had been raised (by Mr Rummery and/or his former legal representatives) as to the date on which evidence of the clearing had first come to the attention of an authorised officer (this apparently having been an issue agitated in the correspondence to which Ms Hicks' March letter responded and having been the subject of at least one earlier notice to produce). Similarly, both the OEH assessment outcome methodology and the ATO assessment notices would reasonably have been available to Mr Rummery at the time of the hearing below.

64Where there might be room for argument as to the unavailability, at an earlier time, of the material on which Mr Rummery now seeks to rely is as to the material the subject of the order for production made on 7 February 2014. There appears to have been a history of attempts by Mr Rummery to obtain material of this kind.

65Mr Rummery says that his lawyers had requested the prosecutor to provide any information on the involvement of Mr Beaman or Mr Turner in the investigation prior to him entering his guilty plea. He refers to the letter from Ms Hicks in March 2012, in which his lawyers were informed that there were ""no records of any documents relating to investigations carried out by Mr Beaman or Mr Turner of OEH concerning the land between 13 August 2008 and 12 November 2009"". In context, that statement appeared as follows: 

In relation to the refined term of the Notice to Produce set out in point 2 of our letter of 27 February 2012, our response is we have no records of any documents relating to investigations carried out by Mr Beaman or Mr Turner of OEH concerning the land between 13 August 2008 and 12 November 2009.

I note the filed affidavits of Mr Turner and Mr Beaman outline what action they did take in relation to the clearing they observed on the property, Yarragool, but that is outside the above period.

66Mr Rummery maintains that this statement was shown to be incorrect and asserts that it was on the basis of that information that he had pleaded the way he did, on advice from his then lawyers.

67The 3 March 2012 letter in its terms responded to a query as to a notice to produce. The Court was informed by Mr Muston that the notice to produce to which the 3 March 2012 letter was responding was one that called (at para 1.4) for any investigations carried out by Mr Beaman and Mr Turner of the OEH concerning the land and any alleged contravention of the Native Vegetation Act on the land between 1 January 2008 and 12 November 2009. It was submitted that there was no error in the response since neither Mr Beaman nor Mr Turner had carried out any investigation of a contravention during the period stated in the letter. 

68On the material to which this Court has been taken, the only arguable inaccuracy (in the statement that there were ""no records of any documents relating to investigations"") is that in his affidavit Mr Beaman referred to having placed the Yarragool property on a flight list of properties to monitor. It is conceivable that there would have been records of that flight list. However, if (as may well have been the case) OEH understood the position up to the time of the flight as being that there was no investigation at that point of any contravention (the formal investigation being treated as commencing after the flight had been taken) then any inconsistency in the response that was given in that letter would be explicable by reference to that understanding.

69That Mr Beaman had looked at the SLATS 07/08 data provided in October 2009, had observed that there had been some change from earlier data and had listed the Yarragool property as one in respect of which aerial photographs should be taken, would not necessarily have amounted to an ""investigation"" if that was understood in a formal sense.

70Similarly, the arguable inconsistency between the commencement of flights on 9 November 2009 (and placement of the Yarragool photographs in an image subfolder dated 9 November 2009) and the statement that there were no records of documents of investigation of a contravention before 12 November 2009 might be explicable if the formal investigation of the Yarragool property did not commence until after the photographs were taken by Mr Roberts on 12 November 2009.

71It is submitted for the prosecutor that the reference in the 3 March letter to ""investigations concerning the land"" must be read, having regard to the context in which the question was being raised, as ""investigations concerning any contravention in respect of the land"".

72Mr Rummery says, in effect, that he entered his guilty plea in March 2012, after receiving legal advice, on the basis that he and/or his lawyers understood from Ms Hicks' response that there had been no investigations concerning the land prior to 12 November 2009. Mr Rummery says that when he later sought to cross-examine Mr Beaman in the sentencing hearing as to Mr Beaman's knowledge of alleged unlawful clearing prior to 12 November 2009, the prosecutor served the October affidavit from Mr Beaman but that he was at this time self-represented, had already entered a guilty plea, and did not have sufficient time to consider his position in that regard.

73Hence Mr Rummery makes complaint as to his inability to examine this issue in the proceedings before the Land and Environment Court which he attributes to a refusal by the prosecutor to produce documents in answer to the earlier notice to produce issued in those proceedings (a copy of which was not in the appeal books before this Court).

74No issue is taken by the prosecutor as to delay by Mr Rummery in seeking the documents for the purposes of these appeal proceedings, it being accepted by the prosecutor that the issue had been raised some time before the application for an order for production was heard in February this year.

75Without in any way suggesting that Mr Rummery's complaint that he was misled by the OEH solicitors' response has any foundation (since that could only be tested by reference to the complete correspondence on that topic and OEH would need to be given an opportunity to be heard on that issue), there is at least some doubt as to whether the material produced in Court to Mr Rummery at the commencement of the hearing was reasonably available to him at the time of the Land and Environment Court hearing.

76Therefore, I would have been inclined to give leave for the admission of the material relied upon as going to the date on which evidence first came to the attention of an authorised officer if this would be likely to have led to a different conclusion on whether the offence had been proved (assuming for this purpose that Mr Rummery's guilty plea were treated as having been withdrawn) or as to the exercise of the discretion on sentencing. However, for the reasons set out below when considering the relevant grounds of appeal, I am not persuaded that this is the case. Therefore, I would refuse leave to admit the additional evidence sought to be relied upon by Mr Rummery in that regard, as well as the additional evidence in relation to the OEH guidelines and Mr Wood's report as to the likelihood of obtaining a property vegetation plan.

77As to the financial material sought to be relied upon, that was admitted during the course of the hearing on the basis that the prosecutor did not object thereto (although the prosecutor maintained that no weight could be put on it).

Conviction appeal

78As noted above, Mr Rummery entered a plea of guilty to the charge on which he was convicted. The principles applicable where an appeal is brought against a conviction after a plea of guilty were considered in Lars, Da Silva and Kalanderian (1994) 73 A Crim R 91 at 109ff and have been adopted and restated in various cases, including more recently in Thalari v R [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at [32]-[35] referred to with approval in Clark v R [2012] NSWCCA 158 at [18] (per Johnson J with Basten JA and Garling J agreeing) and Han v R [2012] NSWCCA 257 at [18] (per Latham J with McClellan CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreeing).

79In Lars, the Court (Wood, Mathews and Badgery-Parker JJ) said that the principle to be applied was said to be the same as that to be applied in a trial court where prior to sentence an accused person seeks leave to withdraw a plea of guilty previously entered (at 109).

80In Thalari, the Court said (at [32]-[35]):

This Court may quash a conviction entered upon a plea of guilty in the sentencing court if it is demonstrated that a miscarriage of justice will occur if the Appellant is not permitted to withdraw the plea: R v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 36; R v Van (2002) 129 A Crim R 229; Elmir v R [2009] NSWCCA 22 at [33]ff.

The onus lies upon the Appellant to demonstrate that leave should be granted: R v Marchando (2000) 110 A Crim R 337 at 338 [4]; R v Toro-Martinez (2000) 114 A Crim R 533 at 536-537 [16]-[23]. The Appellant must establish a good and substantial reason for the Court taking the course of granting leave to withdraw the plea: R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299 at [39]; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 at 46 [39]. An application to withdraw a plea of guilty is to be approached with caution bordering on circumspection: R v Liberti (1991) 66 A Crim R 120 at 122; R v Parkes [2004] NSWCCA 377 at [48]. (my emphasis)

The plea of guilty itself is a cogent admission of the ingredients of the offence: R v SL [2004] NSWCCA 397 at [51]. Indeed, it has been described as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made: Charlesworth v R [2009] NSWCCA 27 at [25].

A person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt, and the entry of a plea of guilty upon such grounds nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence, and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and this will normally only arise where the accused person did not understand the nature of the charge, or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it: Meissner v R (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 157; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 45-46. (my emphasis)

81The proposition that, before the Court will go behind a plea of guilty and entertain an appeal against conviction, it must be satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has occurred was emphasised in R v Kouroumalos [2000] NSWCCA 453, per Wood CJ at CL (with Studdert and Whealy JJ agreeing) at [16], citing R v Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 231; and R v O'Sullivan [2002] NSWCCA 98; (2002) 128 A Crim R 371 at [9]-[12].

82One circumstance where that may be established is where the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charges. Another is where the applicant, on the admitted facts, could not in law have been convicted of the offences charged (Liberti at 121-122). In Kouroumalos at [19], Wood CJ at CL emphasised that what is required is ""the identification of some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt or that otherwise the integrity of the plea is bona fide in question"".

Consideration of conviction appeal grounds 

83Turning first to the grounds on which Mr Rummery contends that his conviction should be set aside, they are, in substance, his contention that the proceedings were statute barred (ground 5); the contention that her Honour erred in not accepting that the clearing fell within the ""imminent risk"" exemption (ground 1); and the contention that her Honour erred in concluding that the charge had been proven (ground 2). I propose to deal first with ground 5, since a conclusion that, even on the facts admitted, Mr Rummery could not have been convicted of the offence charged would be a clear instance where the conviction appeal should succeed.

Ground 5 - that proceedings were statute barred

84As outlined earlier, in the present case the prosecutor relied on s 42(4) of the Native Vegetation Act in commencing the proceedings against Mr Rummery. Therefore, pursuant to sub-s (5), the date on which evidence of the alleged offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer is taken to be the date stated in the summons (12 November 2009) unless the contrary is proved. Had this been raised by way of defence the onus of proving the contrary would lie on Mr Rummery as the party alleging this to be the case.

85Mr Rummery referred to an affidavit affirmed on 25 July 2011 by Mr Beaman that he said was served with the summons. He says that in that affidavit Mr Beaman did not indicate that he (or Mr Turner) had had any further involvement with the investigation of clearing on Yarragool beyond the initial drive past 1 April 2008 and recording of waypoints for clearing not the subject of the charge (to which reference was made in the Statement of Agreed Facts).

86In essence, Mr Rummery seeks to draw from Mr Roberts' 31 January 2012 affidavit, which was filed on 3 February 2012 but not read in the proceedings, that someone within OEH was made aware of the alleged illegal clearing at a time prior to 12 November 2009.

87Mr Roberts deposed (at [6] of his 31 January affidavit) that on or around 2 November 2009 he was made aware of alleged illegal clearing of native vegetation on the Yarragool property and that he was asked by Mr Beaman to arrange vertical aerial photography of the property to be used by the department to define more accurately the extent of clearing that had been detected by a SLATS and to determine whether further clearing had occurred since the date of that survey. He deposed that the aerial photography was first undertaken on 12 November 2009 and then repeated on 17 August 2010. (Copies of the vertical aerial photographs recorded as being taken on those dates are in the appeal books.)

88Mr Roberts further deposed (at [9]) that ""... to further confirm the correct position of the aircraft over the property, [he] checked that readily observable on-the-ground features could be identified on a previously prepared hard copy satellite image of the property"". That is the hard copy satellite image production of which was sought by paragraph 1 of the February order for production.

89Mr Rummery contends that if Mr Roberts was made aware of the alleged illegal clearing on 2 November 2009 (referring to [6] of Mr Roberts' affidavit) then the proceedings are statute-barred (since the summons was filed on 9 November 2011, more than two years after that date).

90Mr Beaman presumably sought to address a contention of that kind in his affidavit affirmed 18 October 2012, which again was served on Mr Rummery but not read in the proceedings. Mr Beaman deposed that OEH received data (SLATS 06/07 data) in August 2008, which indicated that about 77ha of possible clearing had occurred on the Yarragool property between May 2005 and January 2007. He said that this clearing was assessed as not a priority in light of other competing priorities and limited resources and that this clearing was not the subject of the charge against Mr Rummery.

91Mr Beaman deposed that in October 2009 he was provided with the SLATS 07/08 data; that it was in an electronic format; and that it was the role of an officer in the OEH unit to prepare the data into a format that could be ""interpreted by the Unit"" ([6]). He said that when he reviewed the information he noted that it indicated 27ha of landscape change on the property between January 2007 and March 2008 and that caused him to regard the property as a general area of interest for OEH to monitor.

92He confirmed that on or about 2 November 2009 he asked Mr Roberts to undertake a flight to take aerial photographs of a large number of properties in the Armidale region including the Yarragool property. He said that at the time of the flight he had no knowledge of any landscape change on the property that had occurred after the 07/08 SLATS data ([13]).

93Mr Beaman also deposed that Mr Roberts had conducted the flyover of various properties over several days between 9 November and around 17 November 2009; that the images taken of the Yarragool property were lodged in an electronic folder with the date 9 November 2009; that the images were not assessed at that time; and that he was not aware when the assessment was conducted that lead to the further investigation but that he did not review those images until after the Yarragool investigation had commenced ([14]-[17]).

94At the time of production of the ordered documents at the commencement of the hearing Mr Fox gave evidence as to how SLATS data was received by and utilised within the Department. He said that the data was received in a digital form. His understanding of the process was that the satellite image was converted by the satellite operator to an electronic image which was then purchased by the Department but that the image when so purchased was not in a form that could readily be used by the Department's investigators. Mr Fox said that experts in aerial and satellite imagery then undertook work to ""rectify"" that image to ensure that it was an accurate reflection of the particular area of the State of which the image was taken. His understanding that the satellite or electronic image was in a very large file and in its raw form was not broken into its component areas. He said that it was the work of experts in satellite interpretation to process the image into a usable form for the Department's authorised officers for the purpose of investigation (T 11.21-36).

95Mr Fox also gave evidence that the experts in satellite imagery interpretation who carried out the work of ""rectifying"" the satellite images were not authorised officers under the Native Vegetation Act. His understanding was that it would take in the order of between 3 to 6 months or more between the date of the actual image being taken to the date that that image became available to the Department's investigators in a usable form to create images similar to the image produced in answer to paragraph 1 of the order (T 11.37-47).

96Pausing there, it is apparent that the mere receipt of the SLATS 07/08 data as at 13 August 2008 cannot possibly have drawn to the attention of any authorised officer who viewed or accessed that data any evidence of clearing of the property that took place after that date, i.e., after the electronic or digital satellite images were taken. Evidence of clearing after that date based on a comparison with the position shown on the SLATS 07/08 data and subsequent satellite data or aerial photography.

97There was no evidence of receipt by OEH of relevant SLATS data after the 07/08 data. In any event, more than mere receipt of a later satellite image in electronic form would be required to show evidence of unlawful clearing. One would need to have some form of comparison between that and earlier data for that purpose. Mr Fox gave evidence that the information purchased by the department required rectification and the application of software know-how before it was in usable form for authorised officers to review for the purpose of any investigations. That is consistent with the reference in Mr Beaman's affidavit to the provision to him in October 2009 with the SLATS 07/08 data in an electronic format and to it being the role of the unit GIS officer to prepare that information into a format that could be interpreted by the unit.

98The upshot of Mr Beaman's affidavit is that what led to his instruction in November 2009 to Mr Roberts to take aerial photographs of the Yarragool property was that the 07/08 data showed clearing to the property between January 2007 and March 2008 (not any evidence of clearing after 13 August 2008) and that the purpose of that instruction was to be able to assess whether there had been any change in the clearing from that earlier image.

99Mr Rummery considers it highly likely that an authorised officer of OEH had evidence of the alleged illegal clearing prior to 9 November 2009 because: he believes that OEH authorised officers have ready access to high quality satellite imagery; Mr Beaman had prior knowledge and observations of clearing on the property; and because the high cost of conducting a flyover to check existing SLATS data would not be undertaken without up to date satellite imagery of the kind to which Mr Roberts had referred. Mr Rummery submits that it is incomprehensible that the department was operating on two-year-old photography; does not accept that it would have taken months to have access to the satellite images in usable form; and asserts that the department must have had access on desktop computers of SPOT-5 imagery (of the kind used to produce hard copy satellite images such as the one produced in answer to paragraph 1 of the order to produce).

100In this regard, Mr Rummery noted that the expert report of Mr Spiers (an expert in the interpretation of aerial photography) referred to satellite images on 13 August 2008, 19 March 2009 and 24 November 2009 as well as aerial photographs taken on 17 August 2010. Mr Spiers' report states that he had obtained SPOT 5 Satellite Images (being digital images of the satellite images) for the 2008 and 2009 dates from OEH's ""network database"". In his affidavit of 2 August 2011, Mr Spiers deposed that he was provided with the 2008/2009 SPOT-5 satellite images from OEH aerial imagery library staff in order to prepare his report [16] and that the 2008/2009 images were an electronic image, the files containing which were stored on the OEH server ([18]). The prosecutor submits that this does no more than indicate that, at the date of preparation of Mr Spiers' report, the OEH library staff was able to obtain access to those SPOT-5 images, not that they were readily accessible at a much earlier date by authorised officers.

101Mr Rummery's contentions amount to no more than speculation. There might be any number of reasons why it would take time for digital images to be rectified into a form suitable for authorised officers to review and any number of reasons why OEH might consider the cost of a charter flight to be warranted. (In this regard, Mr Beaman's affidavit deposes that the instruction was to take photographs of a large number of properties not just Yarragool.)

102Although what Mr Roberts was told as to the ""unlawful clearing"" on 2 November 2009 is not made clear in Mr Roberts' affidavit, read with Mr Beaman's affidavit it must be inferred that the reference was either to the earlier clearing (observed in April 2008), which is not the subject of the charge, or to the evidence of clearing since then (still not part of the subject charge) that had caused Mr Beaman to decide the property should be monitored. Mr Beaman's evidence was that he had reviewed the data received in October 2009, considered that it showed further clearing from that which had been apparent on the SLATS data for the previous period, and had asked Mr Roberts in that context to carry out the aerial photography.

103Mr Rummery also points to what he maintains is inconsistency between the statement by Mr Beaman that ""At the time of the flight I had no knowledge of any landscape change on the property Yarragool that had occurred after the 07/08 SLATS data"" and a statement in Mr Beaman's first affidavit (recorded in the agreed facts) to the effect that Mr Beaman had personally observed clearing on the property in April 2008, since the latter was after the Jan 07/Mar 08 SLATS dates. That inconsistency would be relevant if Mr Rummery had been prosecuted with the April 2008 clearing but it does not point to any evidence of clearing post August 2008 having come to Mr Beaman's attention before the flight.

104Insofar as ground 5 of the grounds of appeal is put forward as a basis for setting aside the conviction because of an argument that ""at least part of the charge may be statute barred"", the material sought to be relied upon by Mr Rummery does not establish that the date specified in the summons (as to when evidence of the clearing first came to the attention of an authorised officer) was incorrect. That is an issue on which Mr Rummery bears the onus.

105What is put forward by Mr Rummery is largely speculation, namely his belief that authorised officers in the OEH were able to have access to the electronic data in a usable form without the need for the rectification process described briefly by Mr Beaman and elaborated upon by Mr Fox and must have had access to that information in order to justify the cost of a charter flight over his property.

106There is a logical explanation provided by Mr Roberts and Mr Beaman in their respective affidavits as to the course of events. That evidence does not support a conclusion that evidence of the unlawful clearing that was the subject of the charge (i.e., the clearing after 13 August 2008) had come to their attention before they were able to view (from the air) the state of the property on 12 November 2009 and compare that to the hard copy satellite image of what was there on 13 August 2008. (Mere possession of the hard copy satellite image that was taken up with them onto the flight would not have been sufficient to cause them to be aware of post 13 August 2008 clearing.)

107Simply having the ability to access electronic data by way of a computer program (as Mr Rummery contends would have been open to the OEH officers on the basis that it is something to which he himself is readily able to have access through a particular government website) is not sufficient. What would need to be shown is that in some way evidence of unlawful clearing had actually come to an authorised officer's attention. That could only be done by someone accessing or viewing data from which the possibility of such clearing became apparent. If that were not the case, then the evident purpose of sub-s (5) (namely, to provide a time frame in which proceedings can be commenced where the actual date of clearing is not known) would be frustrated simply by the availability of access to search engines or tools such as those to which Mr Rummery referred in his submissions.

108The prosecutor concedes that Mr Beaman's evidence reveals that, as at October 2009, Mr Beaman had knowledge of whatever clearing was shown in the 07/08 SLATS data but says that since that clearing could only have occurred on or prior to 13 August 2008 (that being the date on which the 07/08 SLATS data was captured when the photograph was taken), this does not establish that Mr Beaman had evidence of the clearing the subject of the charge. I agree.

109The prosecutor further contends that there are two reasons why ground 5 does not provide a basis for setting aside Mr Rummery's conviction.

110First, the prosecutor points to Mr Rummery's own evidence (in his affidavit affirmed 17 August 2012 at [69]) to the effect that clearing occurred on the Yarragool property until 10 August 2010. It is submitted that since a prosecution could, even on Mr Rummery's case, have been brought for clearing occurring after 9 November 2009 (the summons having been filed on 9 November 2011), and it is not necessary for the actual date of the clearing to be specified in a summons brought in reliance on sub-s (4), the proceedings could on no view be said to be statute barred. That conclusion is supported by Chief Executive of the Office of Environment and Heritage v Humphries [2013] NSWLEC 213. Provided that some of the period of clearing (as is conceded by Mr Rummery) took place within the two year period, the prosecution is not statute-barred.

111It is submitted that there is no evidentiary basis for concluding that the charge period extended beyond that which is permitted by s 42(4) of the Native Vegetation Act. The prosecutor notes that there is no evidence before the Court that would enable it to determine any argument that might now be run by Mr Rummery to the effect that the 48ha was unlawfully cleared in a time period which was earlier than two years before the summons was filed. (In that regard, the most that is before this Court is Mr Rummery's affidavit evidence as to clearing on 3 days per week at 1ha a day.)

112Reference is made to Mr Spiers' report dated 2 August 2011, as to the aerial photograph interpretation of the vegetation changes on Yarragool between 1970 and 2010, in which he identified the changes from the various images. Mr Spiers confirmed that none of the pre-August 2008 clearing was included in the charge. Mr Spiers identified changes from the satellite images by reference to numbered polygons corresponding to the cleared areas.

113Second, it is submitted that Mr Rummery had full knowledge of all of the relevant facts at the time when his guilty plea was entered, since he had been provided with Mr Roberts' 31 January 2012 affidavit (which Mr Rummery contends discloses the timing issue) prior to entering his plea. This goes to the second matter raised by ground 5, namely whether there was procedural unfairness in the manner contended in that ground.

114The prosecutor notes that the only information which came to Mr Rummery's attention after he entered his guilty plea but before the sentencing hearing was Mr Beaman's 18 October affidavit in which Mr Beaman deposed that the only information he had available to him at any time prior to the flight on 12 November 2013 was a satellite photograph taken on 13 August 2008. It is noted that no issue was taken about this at the time. It is submitted that if there was any inaccuracy in the 3 March 2012 letter, that was clarified when Mr Beaman's affidavit was served, prior to the hearing before Pepper J.

115In the course of submissions on the appeal, Mr Rummery indicated that what he wished to do was to subpoena Mr Beaman in order to ask him what information he had at the relevant time. He contends that he was not given the opportunity to do that in the Land and Environment Court proceedings because he was misinformed by the OEH as to Mr Beaman's involvement and that the provision of the October affidavit from Mr Beaman was provided to him at a time when he was not represented and not able to process the information for the hearing. He candidly accepts that he was out of his depth.

116Mr Rummery emphasises that Mr Beaman must have been central to the making of the decision to request people within the Department to undertake the investigation on his behalf as he was at the time the acting head of the department. He believes that there has been at some level some miscarriage of justice, identifying that as being that he was provided with misinformation on which he relied at the point of making the plea. He submits that the department should have made clear to him who it was that had made Mr Roberts aware of the ""alleged illegal clearing"" and how that person had become aware of this.

117I have no doubt that Mr Rummery is genuine in his stated belief that he has been provided with misinformation by the OEH (just as I accept he is genuine in his belief that the outcome of the proceedings below will cause him to sell the property). However, at the time the earlier notice to produce (and correspondence in relation thereto) was issued, Mr Rummery was represented by lawyers. He had the benefit of legal advice. Had the legal advisers considered that there was anything unclear in the response that had been received it was open to them to press for clarification or for an answer to the notice to produce.

118I am also conscious of the fact that by the hearing Mr Rummery was not represented by lawyers. However, he did not raise any issue before her Honour as to the potential involvement of Mr Beaman in investigations prior to 9 November 2009 concerning any contravention in relation to the property. What is now raised by Mr Rummery is a mixture of assertion and speculation. It is not suggested by him that the only clearing to which his plea of guilty related was clearing before 9 November 2009.

119The principle of finality of litigation is relevant to take into account in this context. Mr Rummery had an opportunity to raise issues in relation to his prosecution when the matter was before her Honour. He did so. He conducted cross-examination of the expert witnesses and he made detailed submissions to her Honour. There is nothing in the material before me to warrant a conclusion that Mr Rummery was denied procedural fairness in the sentencing hearing or that he should now be allowed leave in effect to reopen the case in order to test the prosecution evidence to see whether a limitations defence could be run.

120In my opinion, ground 5 is not made out.

Ground 1 - imminent risk exemption

121In relation to ground 1 of the grounds of appeal, Mr Rummery emphasises the dilemma in which he contends he was placed having regard to the requirements of the OHS Act (as to the steps to be taken to ensure the health and safety of workers in the workplace). While that is a matter that might be taken into account when considering the personal factors on sentencing (as her Honour did), it is no answer to a charge for breach of s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act to point to the requirements of other legislation. There are various instances where the Native Vegetation Act contemplates that conduct permitted under other State legislation will, in effect, override the prohibition in s 12. The OHS Act is not one of them.

122It is not to the point, therefore, that the OHS Act (as Mr Rummery points out) is concerned not with ""imminent risks"" but with an assessment of the likelihood of the risk occurring, the degree of harm that might result, what the person ought to reasonably know about the hazard and ways to eliminate the hazard, the availability of suitable ways to eliminate the hazard and then assessing the cost of elimination. True it is that there are serious penalties under the OHS Act for reckless conduct causing death at a workplace but that does not mean that taking steps to comply with the OHS Act and avoid the prospect of penalty for breach thereof comes within the ""imminent risk"" exemption.

123Nor does the fact, if it be the case, that there is no practical means under the Native Vegetation Act for clearing native vegetation identified as being required under an OHS risk assessment. (Mr Rummery points out in this regard that s 29 of the Native Vegetation Act has the effect that permission to undertake broadscale clearing and approval of property vegetation plans is dependent on the improvement or maintenance of environmental outcomes.)

124Her Honour did not err in my opinion in the construction placed on the ""imminent risk"" exception. Mr Rummery takes issue with the rejection by the primary judge (at [66]) of the notion of permissible clearing being based on a grazier's subjective assessment of his or her mustering skills and the skills of his or her workplace. It is said that this is in direct conflict with an employer's legal responsibilities of the OHS Act (namely, the duty to undertake risk assessment and risk management in the workplace, which Mr Rummery submits can only be subjective). What her Honour was there emphasising, however, was that for the purposes of the imminent risk exception there must be an objective risk. Her Honour did not err in that conclusion.

125Similarly, criticism is made of the statement by the primary judge (at [68]) that the Native Vegetation Act was primarily enacted to ensure the conservation of native vegetation and not as a vehicle to facilitate agricultural activity and to her Honour's implicit conclusion at [70] that the implementation of a clearing strategy was not justified simply by reference to the evidence of accidents while mustering. Mr Rummery submits that this involves a misunderstanding as to the legal obligations as to the provision of a safe workplace. However, the fact is that a landowner in the position of Mr Rummery may have a number of different and perhaps competing obligations does not mean that Mr Rummery's conduct in clearing the property should have been found to fall within the imminent risk exception.

126What her Honour concluded was that ""imminent risk"" was directed towards the risk posed by native vegetation and not the activity per se; that is, that clearing is permitted where native vegetation creates an immediate danger, and not an indeterminate danger at large derived from mustering ([59]), and that the risk required is of serious personal injury ([69]). I agree.

127The substance of Mr Rummery's contention is that he should not be placed in the legal position where it is impossible to comply with one law without breaking another law and that the primary judge erred by not placing sufficient weight on his legal obligations under the OHS Act and not recognising his inability to meet the legal obligations of both laws. However, this focuses on the consequences of the application by the legislation not whether he was liable in the first place.

128The prosecutor maintains that there are three answers to the matters raised in ground 1 of the notice of appeal.

129First, that the offence as charged did not contemplate a particular area of land having been cleared (rather, it related to clearing having been undertaken within a particular date range) and hence that any conflict between the OHS Act and the Native Vegetation Act could at best only provide a basis for setting aside the conviction if acceptance of that contention would mean that all of the clearing undertaken by Mr Rummery was permitted under the imminent risk exception.

130It is submitted that Mr Rummery's admission that he had illegally cleared native vegetation from his property during the charge period (at [69] of his affidavit affirmed 17 August 2012) was sufficient to found the conviction.

131Second, it is submitted that there is no inconsistency between the OHS Act and the Native Vegetation Act. The prosecutor accepts that, throughout the charge period, s 8 of the OHS Act imposed a positive obligation on an employer to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all of the employees of the employer and that this obligation required an employer to ensure that any premises controlled by the employer where the employees work were safe and without risks to health and that systems of work and the working environment of the employees were safe and without risk to health.

132However, the prosecutor maintains that s 28 of the then OHS Act (which provided a complete defence to any proceedings against the person for an offence against, inter alia, s 8 of the OHS Act if that person was able to prove that it was not reasonably practicable to comply with the provision) is a complete answer to the contention by Mr Rummery that the OHS Act required him to remove native vegetation from the property. It is submitted that even if, properly construed, s 8 of the OHS Act would otherwise have required the removal of native vegetation from the property, it was not reasonably practicable for him to have complied with this obligation if the removal of that vegetation was prohibited by the Native Vegetation Act.

133Third, it is submitted that even if there is an inconsistency between the two pieces of legislation it remained for Mr Rummery to bring himself within the exemption contained in s 11(1)(i) of the Native Vegetation Act and that, to do so, he needed to establish that the clearing was ""reasonably considered necessary to remove or reduce an imminent risk of serious personal injury"". The prosecutor notes that her Honour rejected this aspect of Mr Rummery's case at a factual level (referring to [51]-[55] and [61]-[70]).

134Her Honour did not err in my opinion in concluding that there was no ""imminent risk"" established by reference to which part or all of the clearing was reasonably necessary.

Ground 2 - challenge to conviction generally

135The second ground of appeal contains a number of contentions.

136First, it is submitted that the primary judge failed to understand that Mr Rummery had only pleaded guilty to 48ha of illegal clearing. Her Honour's reasons clearly note that this is the case. This contention is unfounded.

137Second, it is submitted that the primary judge erred in accepting the prosecutor's argument that routine agricultural management activities were the only reasons why clearing would not contravene s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act (this being Mr Rummery's understanding of what was said on 23 October 2012 at p 3 of the transcript). However, her Honour clearly had regard to the other exemption relied upon by Mr Rummery (namely the imminent risk exemption).

138Third, it is contended that the primary judge was in error ""in not putting the evidence of the prosecutor on clearing 248 ha to the test of proof under the Native Vegetation Act 2003 s 6(1)(a), s 6(2), s 7(a)(b), s 9(2)(a) before examining the validity of any claimed exceptions"". Mr Rummery refers to the definitions contained in the Native Vegetation Act of ""native vegetation"", ""clearing"" and ""remnant native vegetation"", which have been referred to or set out earlier. Mr Rummery contends that the prosecutor did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that illegal clearing did occur. In particular, he claims that her Honour failed to put the prosecution to proof as to the identification of indigenous native vegetation, the presence of regrowth, the age of the trees cleared and the presence of dead timber. He submits that as those matters could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt, there was no basis for finding that the clearing was unlawful on any area greater than the 48 ha to which he had pleaded guilty.

139The prosecutor's primary answer to this ground of appeal is that the offence as charged did not contemplate the clearing of any particular area of land and that Mr Rummery admitted that he had unlawfully cleared 48ha during the charge period. Hence there is no basis for setting aside the conviction on any of the bases raised in ground 2.

140Turning to the particular contentions made by Mr Rummery in connection with this ground, they may be summarised as follows: 

Identifying indigenous native vegetation

141Mr Rummery contends that the primary judge could not find beyond reasonable doubt that the vegetation alleged to have been unlawfully cleared across the property could be identified as ""indigenous native vegetation"" and therefore that there is no basis for the finding of unlawful clearing of native vegetation across the disputed 130ha.

142The prosecutor relied on the evidence of Dr Nadolny on this issue (Exhibit L). Mr Rummery notes that Dr Nadolny visited the property on 13 October 2010 and on 29 June 2011; that he identified the location of his site inspections by recording GPS waypoints (Maps 1, 2 and 3 at Attachment 3 in Exhibit L) and identified vegetation samples collected by OEH inspectors on 11 and 12 May 2010 at locations identified by GPS waypoints (on maps located in Exhibit A).

143Mr Rummery refers to Dr Nadolny's acceptance in cross-examination that where no waypoints had been recorded he had not visited the areas of alleged clearing and that he was not able directly to identify the species of trees on areas he did not visit. Mr Rummery points to the maps at Tab 10 and 11 in Exhibit G as showing that Dr Nadolny did not visit approximately 130-140ha of the alleged area of clearing. This is not disputed by the prosecutor.

144Mr Rummery also points to cross-examination of Dr Nadolny which he says indicated that Dr Nadolny could only identify cleared trees to species if he was within 10 metres or closer to allow him to inspect leaves and bark; and that if the clearing had occurred 2 or 3 years previously then only bark would be available to inspect.

145Mr Rummery notes that Dr Nadolny claimed he used extrapolation techniques and viewed aerial photographs of the property from 1970, 1986 and 1993 to determine that the vegetation cleared in the areas he did not visit on the site visits would have been indigenous native vegetation. Mr Rummery contends that there was no evidence that the vegetation viewed in aerial photos was the same vegetation that was cleared; that Dr Nadolny did not use specialist equipment (stereoscope) to examine the photos in a 3-dimensional view which would allow the different levels of vegetation (trees, shrubs and groundcover) to be identified.

146Mr Rummery notes that Mr Spiers, who examined the property from aerial photographs (using a stereoscope) and high quality satellite images, stated in his report that he was not required to determine species for which the requirement of canopy detail and field checking were needed and that Dr Nadolny had agreed with this.

147Mr Rummery called expert evidence from Mr Travis Peake to the effect that in order to determine whether or not species is native or otherwise it is necessary to identify the plants themselves and cannot readily be done simply by looking at their features or growth form.

148However, as the prosecutor notes, there was no requirement that it establish beyond reasonable doubt that the whole of the 191ha of cleared vegetation was indigenous vegetation. All that was necessary was to establish that the vegetation cleared ""included"" vegetation that existed in New South Wales before European settlement (Walker Corporation at [33]). This was established by [29] and [30] of the Statement of Agreed Facts filed on 2 August 2012.

149The prosecutor submits that there is no doubt as to the area across which clearing took place and there was no dispute that amongst the vegetation cleared were species which were present in New South Wales prior to the date of European colonisation. If Mr Rummery sought to advance a case that all of the vegetation removed was noxious weeds or the like, the onus was on him to do so.

150There is no substance to the appeal from conviction on this ground.

Evidence of regrowth - age, trigger event for regrowth and clearing of live/dead trees

151Mr Rummery maintains that it was necessary (for the prosecutor to prove that there was unlawful clearing) for the prosecutor to prove that the clearing that occurred was not of regrowth as defined in s 9(2)(a) of the Native Vegetation Act.

152He points out that Dr Nadolny was required to assess/estimate the age of the cleared trees on the property and that the prosecutor did not give evidence of any direct measurement of the age of any of the cleared trees on the property (such as dendrochronology, i.e. the counting tree rings). Mr Rummery notes Dr Nadolny's claim that annual growth rings are very pronounced on the New England tablelands because of the very seasonal climate. Mr Rummery also notes that Dr Nadolny admitted to measuring the breast height diameter of very few cleared trees and relied on his ""fairly rough and ready"" estimates to come to the conclusion that ""most of the felled trees were in the size range of 25-45 cm diameter"".

153Mr Rummery points out that Dr Nadolny's expert report states that in his experience trees grow at about 1 cm diameter per year but that in a further expert report Dr Nadolny explained that this experience was based on measurements taken of the growth rate of four trees on a property approximately 100 km from Yarragool. Mr Rummery notes that one of the said trees was of a species not identified on Yarragool and the other three trees represented only one species; that no data were presented on the climate, time frame for growth, landscape position, competition effects, soil type, soil depth or soil fertility, fertiliser history, water supply, elevation or aspect or any factors that may have influenced the growth rate of those four trees.

154Dr Nadolny and Mr Peake both agreed tree growth rates could be very variable and dependant on a large number of factors.

155Mr Rummery points to growth rate data from three sites located either within the alleged cleared area or immediately adjacent to the area and says that trees of known age that had grown since 1985 were measured on failed dam walls, with the growth rate measured on these sites at 2.1 cm diameter per year, twice that recorded by Dr Nadolny. Mr Rummery says that, although Dr Nadolny claimed Mr Rummery's data was unrepresentative (as the growing environment was unrepresentative of the general paddock environment), Dr Nadolny conceded that the tree growth rates measured on Yarragool could be correct (though stating that they would be at the upper end of the expected variability).

156Mr Rummery again notes that Mr Spiers, who identified that vegetation was present in disputed cleared areas prior to 1 January 1990, had noted in his report that he had not attempted to make any conclusions as to the absolute age of the vegetation involved. Mr Rummery also points to the explanation by Mr Spiers that each set of aerial photographs provides a snap shot of what was in existence at the time of the photography and what may have occurred at some time prior to the time of the photography and that ""[a]ll the interpretations are restricted to the times at which the aerial photographs were flown"" as showing that the prosecutor brought no evidence that any vegetation observed in aerial photographs from prior to 1990 was the same vegetation that was cleared between 2008 and 2010.

157Mr Rummery emphasises that the history of the property included two trigger events to spark regrowth: the widespread poisoning of trees across the property between 1988 and 1991 (on areas identified on a particular map as agreed in the Statement of Agreed Facts); and the removal of a large number of sheep from the property in late 1990. He contends that the prosecutor was unable to bring any evidence of unlawful clearing on these areas as the OEH officers did not visit these areas and hence that the prosecutor was unable to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the clearing was not regrowth or that the trees were alive when cleared.

158Mr Rummery contends that her Honour correctly identified that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the estimated age of the trees was as high as contended by the prosecutor but erred in concluding that there was sufficient evidence to estimate the age of the trees at all.

159The prosecutor contends, and I agree, that there was no requirement that the prosecutor establish that what was cleared was not ""regrowth"". The onus of proof rested on Mr Rummery if he wished to rely on the regrowth exemption under s 19 of the Native Vegetation Act (Director General of the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water v Walker Corporation Pty Ltd (No 2) [2011] NSWLEC 229 at [134]). Preston CJ of LEC in Walker Corporation (No 2) at [136]-[144] identified the five matters necessary to be established for such a defence. The prosecutor submits that it is clear from her Honour's reasons at [90] that Mr Rummery did not seek to do so.

160Indeed, Mr Rummery's submissions on appeal make clear that he was not relying on the ""regrowth"" exception (though he does submit it is a mitigating factor). Rather, Mr Rummery maintains that the prosecutor had an onus to negative ""regrowth"". As a matter of statutory construction that is not the case as was made clear in Walker Corporation (No 2) (at [133]ff).

161In any event, the prosecutor notes that to establish a regrowth defence it is necessary to establish that the cleared vegetation ""was only regrowth"". The prosecutor maintains, and I agree, that the fact the prosecution did not seek to prove it was not regrowth is not an answer to the charge.

162As to evidence of poisoning and that there were areas of the property which the ecologist Dr Nadolny had not visited, the prosecutor accepts that what Dr Nadolny did was to look at transects and plots to identify what he was able to find within them and using statistics he sought to expand that out. The prosecutor maintains that there was evidence as to what was cleared and what was present prior to 1 January 1990 (that being the evidence of Mr Spiers).

163Reference is made to Mr Spiers' report (at [34]) in which five intervals of clearing between 15 November 2004 and 24 November 2009 were identified and to Mr Spiers' conclusion (at [35]), based on his examination of the aerial photographs and satellite imagery, that in all areas there was native vegetation cleared that was not vegetation that had re-grown since 1 January 1990. The prosecutor accepts that some vegetation cleared may have been regrowth and that some may have grown post-1990 but emphasises that Mr Rummery bore the onus of proof and that in all of the areas cleared at least some of the cleared vegetation was present prior to 1 January 1990.

164This ground of appeal is not made out.

Appeal Against Sentence

Ground 3 - assessment of level of harm caused by unlawful clearing

165Mr Rummery indicated that ground 3 was not pressed if ground 2 of the notice of appeal were not successful. On that basis, strictly speaking it would not be necessary to deal with this aspect of the appeal, although, in the event that the finding as to ground 2 were to be incorrect, it would be appropriate to address ground 3. Furthermore, it seems from Mr Rummery's submissions that the basis on which he may have considered ground 3 could not be pressed if he were unsuccessful on ground 2 was that a finding that her Honour did not err as to the area of unlawful clearing would be determinative of the level of harm caused by the clearing.

166Mr Rummery submits that if the area is found to be significantly smaller than originally found then the level of harm should be found to be similarly reduced. Insofar as he relies in support of this ground on the challenge to the area of clearing, his challenge fails for the above reasons. However, Mr Rummery's submissions in relation to the assessment of level of harm caused by the unlawful clearing go beyond the issue as to the area of the clearing, as will be discussed below.

167Mr Rummery raises much of the same issues as to the alleged lack of evidence put before the Court as to ground 2 in the context of ground 3. He points to her Honour's acceptance of the proposition that on matters of sentence the Court must not take facts into account in a manner that is adverse to the defendant unless those facts have been proven beyond reasonable doubt ([30]) and maintains that the essential elements to establish unlawful clearing were not able to be proved beyond reasonable doubt (as the prosecution could not provide evidence to support the premise that the trees cleared were live, remnant native indigenous vegetation over an area of 248 ha).

168It is contended that the primary judge erred in determining both the area of alleged clearing and the number of trees unlawfully cleared and has therefore erred in characterising the clearing as extensive ([85], [87]).

169Mr Rummery notes that the primary judge rejected the prosecutor's estimate of the number of trees cleared and accepted Mr Rummery's evidence but says that the number of trees cleared identified by him in cross examination referred to the total number of trees including very small trees. Mr Rummery maintains that measurements collected by OEH investigators on the size of cleared trees identified 22% of the trees were less that 25 cm breast height diameter; that being the size identified by Dr Nadolny as regrowth. Therefore it is submitted that the primary judge's estimate of the number of trees cleared unlawfully should have been reduced by 22%.

170Mr Rummery also challenges her Honour's assessment that the commission of the offence caused moderate to substantial harm ([120]). He contends that the level of harm was overstated having regard to the broad rejection of the evidence on which the prosecutor had relied and the inability of the prosecutor to establish that the area of unlawful clearing was 248ha. Mr Rummery maintains that the level of harm was low based on the reduced area of unlawful clearing and the lack of proof of any actual environmental harm being caused by the thinning of smaller trees.

171The prosecutor maintains that her Honour did not err in rejecting the contention that the clearing of 191ha of the removed vegetation was permitted by s 11(1)(i) of the Native Vegetation Act. (The prosecutor nevertheless accepts that if, contrary to the prosecutor's submissions as to ground 1, the clearing of that 191ha was lawful, then the environmental harm caused by the unlawful component of the clearing would need to be reassessed and that the outcome of that reassessment would likely impact upon the penalty imposed.)

172As to the findings regarding environmental harm, the prosecutor notes that the process adopted by her Honour in concluding that the total number of trees cleared was in the vicinity of 18,000 to 20,000 was supported by the evidence referred to by the primary judge and involved a rejection of the evidence put forward by the prosecutor in relation to this issue. The number of trees felled was said by the primary judge to be important but not determinative of the environmental harm caused by the clearing ([86]).

173As to the number of trees unlawfully cleared, the regrowth exception was applicable only if it could be established that what was cleared was ""only"" regrowth. Her Honour's conclusion as to the number of trees felled was supported by the evidence and has not been shown to be incorrect.

174Insofar as Mr Rummery takes issue with the findings as to the age of the trees cleared, the prosecutor notes that her Honour accepted that the majority of the trees cleared were significantly younger than had been suggested by the prosecutor, concluding that trees were within an age range of 40 to 80 years with the majority of those cleared being at the lower end of this age spectrum ([101]). It is also noted that her Honour considered that the fact that the trees cleared were younger than had been suggested by the prosecutor diminished the objective seriousness of the offence (by which it must be inferred the environmental harm caused by the offence) but only marginally ([102]). In these circumstances, the prosecutor submits that no error in the primary judge's approach to assessing the environmental harm caused by the offence has been demonstrated.

175There is, however, a difficulty with the finding that the majority of the trees felled were between 40 and 80 years ([101]). Dr Nadolny's evidence was that the majority of felled trees that he observed during the site inspections had a stem size of 25-45 DBH. Dr Nadolny also observed that the cleared area had included ""smaller trees of pole or sapling form"". On Dr Nadolny's evidence as to tree growth rates (referred to at [153]-[155] above), an estimate of tree age based on the measurements taken by him during the site inspections would put the likely age of the majority of those felled trees at 25-45 years (or at least more than 20 years to, say, 40 years). As noted earlier ([154]-[155]), both experts agreed that tree growth rates could be variable, though Dr Nadolny considered that the growth rates contended for by Mr Rummery would be at the upper end of the expected variability.

176Mr Peake (at [132] of his report) said that a substantial proportion of the overstorey species would have been established since 1970 (i.e., by 2008-2010 would have been in the order of at least 38-40 years' old) and that a reasonable proportion of the overstorey species cleared would have been established since 1990 (i.e., by 2008-2010 would have been in the order of at least 18-20 years' old).

177Her Honour noted that Mr Peake was of the opinion that overall the harm was reasonable or moderate (at [117]). Mr Peake's assessment of the harm as moderate, notwithstanding that in his view the trees cleared were younger in age than estimated by Dr Nadolny, is consistent with the recognition by her Honour that the retention of younger trees is necessary ([102]). At [118] her Honour noted the importance of native vegetation for the maintenance of fauna habitat.

178Her Honour noted (at [100]) that the expert evidence was that tree growth rates could not be precisely determined in the absence of comprehensive quantitative analysis (of which there had been none in the proceedings). Although her Honour's finding as to the number of trees cleared has not been shown to have been in error, the conclusion that the majority of trees the subject of clearing were between 40 and 80 years' old is not supported by the evidence. That was one of the matters that her Honour took into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.

179Therefore, while there was no error demonstrated in her Honour's acceptance, for the purpose of sentencing, that the factual elements of the offence had been established to the requisite degree of proof, there was an error in one of the matters on which her Honour relied in reaching the conclusion that there was ""moderate to substantial"" environmental harm caused by the clearing.

180Although Mr Rummery did not in oral submissions press this challenge to her Honour's findings, the prosecutor did address this issue in written submissions (at [28(c)-(d)]) and in oral submissions was content to rest on those submissions for the contention that the challenge to her Honour's finding as to the level of harm had not been made good. The prosecutor pointed to her Honour's conclusion (at [101]) that the fact that the trees cleared were younger than had been suggested by the prosecutor diminished the objective seriousness of the offence only marginally.

181Given that the prosecutor's submissions specifically address the issue as to the age of the trees, and the error is one that is identified in Mr Rummery's submissions, the fact that Mr Rummery (who did not have the benefit of legal representation) indicated that ground 3 would only be pressed if ground 2 were successful does not lead me to conclude that this Court should not proceed to consider the effect on Mr Rummery's sentence appeal of the error that has been established in her Honour's finding as to the age of the trees.

182It is clear that her Honour's finding as to the level of environmental harm caused by the offence took into account an erroneous finding as to the age of the felled trees. That matter, which her Honour noted was not determinative, cannot be dismissed as having no significance in her Honour's reasoning. To that extent, part of the basis on which ground 3 challenges her Honour's finding as to the level of harm is made out.

183In those circumstances, it is necessary to consider whether, on the assumption that the majority of trees cleared were in the 20-40 year range, but all other factual findings by her Honour were correct, the environmental harm was ""moderate to substantial"" and what impact this has on the size of the fine imposed on Mr Rummery.

184There was no dispute by Mr Rummery's expert that the level of environmental harm was at least ""moderate"". Given the number of trees, the extent of the clearing and that the retention of younger trees is necessary for the maintenance of native vegetation, in my opinion her Honour did not err in finding that ""moderate to substantial"" environmental harm had been caused. Nevertheless, the fact that the majority of the trees felled were younger than her Honour considered them to be, and that Mr Rummery would (had he confined himself to clearing only regrowth) have been lawfully able to clear an unknown proportion of those trees, taken with the matters considered by her Honour from [120] as other factors relevant to sentencing, leads me to conclude that the size of the fine should be revisited.

185I consider that, adopting the findings made by her Honour as to the discount to be applied to reflect Mr Rummery's personal circumstances, and bearing in mind that Mr Rummery was also ordered to pay the prosecutor's costs, the appropriate fine would be $66,000 (that being 66% of the pre-discounted original fine of $120,000 but rounded down to $100,000 i.e., 66% of $100,000).



Ground 4 - financial consequences of the penalty

186Mr Rummery contends that the primary judge failed to understand that he had no capacity to pay a fine. In this regard, he emphasises the legal costs incurred in his defence; the lack of profitability in a grazing business; and the ""real possibility of having to sell the family home and farm business"".

187Mr Rummery notes that the prosecutor did not contest any of the matters raised in the affidavits relied upon in relation to his financial position. He notes that he has four school age dependent children and says that their school based activities have been curtailed by a lack of funds brought about by the expenses of the case. He says that he had borrowed $90,000 to fund legal representation but then had to dismiss that representation due to no further funds being available and represented himself because of lack of funds. He says that he sold large numbers of livestock to pay $60,000 in fees for expert witnesses (to counter what he maintains were the overstated opinions and assumptions made by the prosecution experts) which has had the ongoing impact of having lost the capacity to generate income into the future to meet the costs of living, business and the legal costs.

188Mr Rummery says that he has agreed costs with the prosecutor at $40,000 and has reached an agreement to pay off these costs over five years. He submits that the total financial costs of the trial are about $270,000 and submits that this ""will probably result in the sale of the family home and the farm"" to cover the debts incurred.

189Mr Rummery appreciates that the fine imposed was only about 10% of the maximum fine available for an offence under the Native Vegetation Act and that it was heavily discounted to $80,040 for entering an early guilty plea and acknowledgement of his financial circumstances. He acknowledges that her Honour correctly assessed the factors that go towards determining an appropriate penalty. However, Mr Rummery claims that the level of the fine is well beyond the reality of a grazing business and well beyond his capacity to pay.

190Mr Rummery submits that he should not have to incur a significant financial penalty on top of the costs and the time taken to defend an inaccurate and overstated case that was not consistent with the prosecutor's obligations as a model litigant. In this regard, Mr Rummery submits that the prosecutor provided false information to him (as to the investigation dates) prior to a plea being entered and did nothing to rectify the situation until forced by Mr Rummery to provide further information some 7 months later. Mr Rummery also emphasises the perceived conflict between the Native Vegetation Act and the OHS Act in this context.

191The prosecutor submits that her Honour took the matters raised by Mr Rummery in relation to this ground into account (at [163]) and that her Honour accepted (at [168]) that the imposition of anything more than a nominal fine would cause him a degree of financial distress but that her Honour was unable to conclude that the imposition of a penalty would cause the sale of the family home.

192The prosecutor submits that the evidence before the primary judge supported her Honour's conclusions in that regard. Mr Rummery's bank manager expressed the view that the imposition of a fine ""may result in the forced sale of one or both of the properties owned by [Mr Rummery] in partnership with his wife"" ([14] of the affidavit of Mr Peter Haynes affirmed 15 June 2012); and that Mr Rummery's accountant expressed the view that Mr Rummery was not in a position to pay a large fine and that the imposition of a fine will create ""significant pressure on [Mr Rummery's] business and unfortunately will have an impact on other members of his family"" ([7] of the affidavit of Mr Grahame Sharpe sworn 18 June 2012).

193As to the additional information tendered by Mr Rummery in relation to his capacity to pay a fine, the prosecutor notes that it does not address the deficiency in the evidence before her Honour as to whether the financial distress that would be caused would force a sale of the property.

194It is clear from her Honour's reasons that her Honour did take into account the economic impacts of a fine on Mr Rummery. What her Honour did not accept was that the evidence disclosed that this would necessarily extend to a requirement that Mr Rummery sell his property. Nothing in the material now adduced addresses that issue. In any event, her Honour plainly had regard to this issue and her discretion has not been shown to have miscarried in any way in so doing.

195The prosecutor notes that her Honour took into account that Mr Rummery's evidence was that he undertook the clearing activities to meet what he understood to be his legal obligations under the OHS Act (at [140]).

196Mr Rummery submitted that the value of agricultural property bore extremely limited correlation to the profitability of agriculture and that this had been the case for more than a decade. He submitted that the two properties were run as part of the one business and conceded there was no evidence of the values of the properties.

197No error has been shown in the exercise of her Honour's discretion in sentencing nor can the penalty be said to be manifestly excessive. It is unfortunate given Mr Rummery's evidence as to his conservation techniques that he is in this position and I am by no means unsympathetic to his position. Nor, as I read her Honour's reasons, was her Honour. Nevertheless the challenge based on ground 4 of the grounds of appeal is not made out.

Conclusion

198For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the appeal from conviction should be dismissed but that the appeal from the sentence imposed on Mr Rummery should be allowed and the fine reduced to $66,000.

199JOHNSON J: I agree with Ward JA.

200R S HULME AJ: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Ward JA. I agree with her Honour's conclusions and reasons in respect of grounds 1, 2 and 4. I also agree with Ward JA that Pepper J erred in the course of coming to the conclusion she did in respect of the level of harm resulting from the Appellant's actions - a conclusion which is the subject of the Appellant's ground 3. However, in my view Pepper J's errors were of greater significance than Ward JA and Johnson J regard them.

201At [77]-[85] of her reasons Pepper J concluded that, based on evidence Mr Rummery had given, but adjusted for the greater area that she found had been the subject of illegal clearing, approximately 18,000 to 20,000 trees were cleared by Mr Rummery.

202Her Honour also recorded that:-
[95] ... Based on a (diameter) growth rate of 1 cm per year Dr Nadolny ""estimated that any trees greater than 25cm DBH were at least 20 years old.

[96] During site inspections undertaken on 13 October 2010, 3 May and 29 June 2011, Dr Nadolny recorded the majority of felled trees having a stem size of 25 - 45 DBH, with some larger trees having a stem size of 70 - 80 cm DBH. He therefore concluded that he cleared vegetation was comprised mainly of trees that were 80 years old.

[99] ... measurements taken by Dr Nadolny indicating that the majority of felled trees had a stem size of 24 - 45 DBH, with only some of the larger trees having a DBH of 70 - 80 cm meant that he had overestimated the age of removed trees.

[101] At its highest, therefore, the evidence revealed that the majority of trees the subject of clearing were between 40 and 80 years old, with only a small proportion comprising more mature trees. That is to say, the majority of the trees were at the lower end of the age spectrum. ...

[102] But having found that the majority of the trees that were cleared were not as mature as that contended for by the prosecutor, and although the clearing of more mature trees is generally considered to be of greater objective seriousness (as stated by Dr Nadolny), the retention of the younger trees is nevertheless necessary. Accordingly, the fact that most of the trees that were unlawfully removed were not as mature as submitted by the prosecutor diminishes the objective seriousness of the offence only marginally.

[118] The unlawful clearing resulted in the near total removal of native vegetation, including approximately 18,000 to 20,000 trees aged 40 years or more and some portion of an EEC, over an area covering 239 ha that previously had the density of woodland. The clearing increased fragmentation of habitat and removed native vegetation important to the maintenance of fauna habitat.

[120] Taking all of these factors into account, I find the commission of the offence caused moderate to substantial environment harm although not as substantial as the prosecutor posited. I accept, therefore, that in these circumstances the harm is to considered as an aggravating factor in terms of s21A(2)(g) of the CSPA.

203Ward JA has pointed out that the observations in [101] to the effect that ""the majority of trees the subject of clearing were between 40 and 80 years old"" were erroneous. However the magnitude of the error must be noted. On the basis of Dr Nadolny's evidence, relied on by Pepper J that the majority of trees had a stem size of 25 - 45 DBH, the majority of trees were more between 20 years and about 40 years old, half the age that her Honour found. (In what I have just said, I do not forget that it was recognised by experts on both sides that growth rates could not be precisely determined in the absence of comprehensive quantitative analysis, none of which had been undertaken. However, the substance of the point just made remains valid, including that the age of the trees was about half of the age used by Her Honour.)

204I accept that Pepper J took the view that ""the fact that most of the trees that were unlawfully removed were not as mature as submitted by the prosecutor diminishes the objective seriousness of the offence only marginally"". Her Honour was not of course addressing the difference to which I have just adverted and in any event I simply cannot accept that a reduction in the age of the trees to the extent indicated can properly be regarded as other than very significant. There was I think no evidence which related the extent of foliage to the age of trees but it is not unreasonable to infer that a tree twice as old is likely to have at least something of the order of twice as much foliage and to be about twice as valuable to the environment.

205I do not suggest of course that the age of the trees was the only matter taken into account in her Honour's assessment that the environmental harm resulting from the commission of Mr Rummery's offence was ""moderate to substantial"", a description which, I might say, encompassed a very wide range. However, in that that assessment reflected the error to which I have referred, I am satisfied that the harm was significantly less than her Honour's assessment.

206But there is another factor which in my view should further reduce the fine. It is clear that a significant proportion of the trees cleared by Mr Rummery were trees classified by the Crown's witness Dr Nadolny as regrowth. In another sample taken by OEH investigators, they recorded the DBH of some 20 trees. Two, or 10%, had a DBH in the regrown category of under 25 cm, viz. 21 and 23 cm.

207Provided he cleared only regrowth, Mr Rummery was entitled to clear these trees - Native Vegetation Act, s19. (I ignore the qualification in the section about ""protected regrowth"" as there was no suggestion in the evidence that this had any relevance in this case.)

208Of course, having not so confined himself, the clearing of the regrowth was part of Mr Rummery's offence but it nevertheless seems to me the fact that 10 to 20% or so of the trees could lawfully have been cleared was something which went to lessen the seriousness of the offence and should have been taken into account in any determination of the penalty.

209On these grounds I favour a lesser fine than that which Ward JA and Johnson J think appropriate. However, as I am in a minority, it is unnecessary that I specify that lesser fine.

210I agree that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed and that the appeal against sentence should be allowed.

2764160,R v Marwan JUBRAEEL [2014] NSWSC 838,"JUDGMENT

Remarks on Sentence

1HIS HONOUR: A jury has found Marwan Jubraeel guilty of the charge of murder, related to the death of Colin Wick. Criminal culpability for the murder depended on the principles of extended joint criminal enterprise. It is necessary to outline Mr Jubraeel's involvement in the crime. 

The Facts

2On 23 July 2011, Mr Jubraeel and two others travelled to Chatham Street, Canley Heights, in a white Toyota Corolla. The three offenders went to 25 Duke Street, Canley Heights. Each was dressed in dark clothing. Each was wearing a balaclava and gloves to hide his identity. One of the other offenders was armed. 

3The first time Mr Jubraeel became aware of the presence of a gun was when he first saw it. I am not satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Jubraeel was aware of the presence of the gun before it was drawn by the shooter, which was just prior to the shooting. 

4I am satisfied, consistent with the jury's verdict, that he was aware of the gun at a time that would have allowed him to withdraw from the original crime, which he did not. 

5The offenders banged on the double-glass sliding door at 25 Duke Street several times. The deceased ran from his bedroom to investigate the source of the noise, followed by Eleanor Attard. The deceased reached over a lounge to pull back the curtain to reveal the window (or to look outside).

6On the other side of the glass doors were the three co-offenders, including Mr Jubraeel. Almost immediately upon drawing the curtain, a co-offender discharged the weapon once, shooting the defendant in the chest. The weapon was aimed, either before the curtain was drawn or when the deceased commenced to draw it.

7The bullet pierced the deceased's aorta and right lung, exited through his back and lodged in a wall in the lounge room.

8The deceased moved backwards towards his bedroom and said, ""Help! I've been shot!"", before collapsing in the hallway. He died shortly thereafter.

9The three offenders ran back to the white Toyota. It would not start and they left on foot. Ms Attard rang the emergency number (000). Emergency services arrived a short time later and established a crime scene.

10The white Toyota was identified as suspicious by nearby residents. It had arrived at or about the time of the shooting, male voices were heard in the immediate vicinity of the car, and the car would not start, despite attempts, immediately after the shooting.

11Mr Jubraeel made admissions to his then girlfriend, who gave evidence in the proceedings, relating to his flight from the scene, including the disposal of items at or near the river close to the scene of the crime. 

12The three offenders went to 25 Duke Street to commit a break, enter and steal. No one was expected to be home. 

13I am not satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Jubraeel was aware of the gun and contemplated a murder before the gun was drawn, which was outside the glass doors. As a consequence, I find Mr Jubraeel intended a break, enter and steal, or intimidation (or both) but no substantial violence. He did not shoot the victim, Mr Wick, nor intend serious harm to him. 

14As a consequence of the foregoing, being a liability of Mr Jubraeel, sheeted home on account of extended joint criminal enterprise, Mr Jubraeel, while guilty of murder, had no intention to injure, committed no unlawful and dangerous act that caused death, and did not plan or organise the conduct leading to the death of Mr Wick. 

15Further, on the evidence in this trial, I am satisfied that the co-offender shooter, who committed the murder, had a state of mind that did not include an intention either to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, but, rather, a reckless indifference to human life. 

16There are aggravating features to the commission of the crime: the actual use of a weapon; conduct in company; the offence was in the victim's home; and some limited planning for the originally agreed offence, e.g. disguise and obtaining the car.

17On the other hand, an ameliorating factor is the planning related to the stealing offence, not the murder for which I am now sentencing Mr Jubraeel.

Subjective Circumstances

18There is a psychologist's report of 15 May 2014, which deals with Mr Jubraeel's early childhood and disabilities. The psychologist, Ms Anna Robilliard, tested Mr Jubraeel and dealt with his prior drug use. 

19Associated with the sentencing in this matter is notified offences on a Form 1, relating to the possession of a prohibited weapon (a taser) and the possession of both cannabis and methyl-amphetamine. I find that the drugs were possessed for personal use, which is consistent with the psychologist's report. 

20Mr Jubraeel had a traumatic childhood. He was born in Iraq of Assyrian parents and was, it seems, subject to significant persecution on the basis of his Christian faith. His father was engaged in the war with Iran (described by Mr Jubraeel as a war with Persia) and his family left their home and lived for a time in Baghdad. During that time, Mr Jubraeel observed people being killed, stabbed and bashed on a frequent basis. The killings and injuries were part of a ""war against Christians"", being the religious persecution of which I have earlier spoken. 

21His family then went to Jordan and ultimately Lebanon before immigrating to Australia. In Jordan, Mr Jubraeel worked, despite his young age. He arrived in Australia at the age of sixteen. When he arrived in Australia, Mr Jubraeel spoke no English. Nor did his parents. 

22Mr Jubraeel commenced drug use just prior to his prior criminal trial. He originally commenced using cannabis for ""stress"" and quickly developed a daily habit. His personal consumption increased to four to five grams of cannabis per day which then progressed to the use of methyl-amphetamines. Mr Jubraeel ceased using drugs when he was arrested for the present offence and has been clean of drugs since his arrest. He expresses remorse for his drug use, which he describes as having ""wrecked his life"". 

23Mr Jubraeel was tested for Verbal Comprehension and Perceptual Reasoning for which he gained scores of 1 percentile and 0.5 percentile respectively. The Verbal Comprehension may be affected by the fact that English is not Mr Jubraeel's first language, but the scores place Mr Jubraeel in the lowest 1% of the community and place him in the Intellectually Disabled range. 

24The lack of access and collateral information and testing prevents a classification of the disability within mild or moderate range, beyond that which I have already cited from the psychologist's report. 

25Notwithstanding his low score, he has a ""concrete approach to problem solving compared to his age group"", but a slower rate of problem solving. His ability and flexibility to generate alternative solutions to problems is impoverished. 

26At the time of the offending, the psychologist's tests suggest that Mr Jubraeel was well above the threshold for a diagnosis of Substance Dependence Disorder. 

27I accept that the findings and comments of the psychologist as to the effect of Mr Jubraeel's violent upbringing as a basis on which he has ""come to see the world as a more hostile place and violence itself as a currency for conflict resolution"".

28Apart from the traumatic experiences in Iraq and Lebanon, his father, seemingly as a result of years of trauma, was a strict disciplinarian who meted out violent punishments. 

29It seems that Mr Jubraeel has past problems managing his anger and was expelled from High School for fighting with a teacher. Later in these reasons I will refer, particularly in regard to its effect on the sentence to be imposed, to the fact that Mr Jubraeel has previously been convicted of an offence involving violence, it seems, again, as a result of his anger management and violence issues. 

30The evidence before the Court suggests that Mr Jubraeel is using his current incarceration in a constructive way and is seeking to do courses that will assist him in obtaining employment on his release. He has abstained from drugs and the psychologist has, after testing, rated his risk of re-offending as between low and moderate. Ms Robilliard expressed the opinion: 

""If he continued to abstain from alcohol and drugs and from associating with anti-social peers post release his risk level would be expected to remain at its present level and diminish further with time. When he committed the Index offence it is likely his drug use and associated social network and activities would have equated to a diagnosis of Substance Dependence Disorder.""

31Mr Jubraeel has the support of his family, none of whom have criminal or substance abuse issues. 

32The psychologist's report gives an understanding of Mr Jubraeel, which allows one to understand, better, why the offending has occurred and Mr Jubraeel's risk of re-offending and chances at rehabilitation. 

33I consider Mr Jubraeel has sound prospects of rehabilitation, particularly if he continues to remain drug free. I consider that the rehabilitation he has undertaken while in prison will need to be confirmed in custody and consider a longer period of supervision in the community is necessary and, for that reason, find special circumstances. 

Sentencing Principles

34As is specified by s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the purposes of sentencing any offender, even those charged with murder, seek to reflect what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting goals. In serious crimes such as murder, the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large. These include the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform. 

35In considering each of those factors, particularly the protection of the community, personal and public deterrence, and punishment, one must have regard to the gravity of the circumstances viewed objectively, within the range of crimes that may fall within the offence charged. The objective seriousness of an offence points most obviously to the factors that require protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, and to retribution and denunciation. 

36Reform or rehabilitation may also be significantly affected by the objective circumstances of the offences, but reform is a factor affected most obviously by the subjective circumstances and the capacity for rehabilitation. That capacity for, and the likelihood, if any, of, rehabilitation in turn impacts upon the degree to which a sentence is fixed that ensures the protection of society and the personal deterrence of the offender. There is usually no single correct sentence and the often-complicated interplay of considerations of guideposts points in different directions: Veen v R (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465. 

37Sentencing is an intuitive process and must remain so. 

Consideration

38Murder is the most serious of offences, with the maximum sentence being life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period being 20 years' imprisonment. A full-time custodial sentence is warranted. Allowance must be made for the matters already mentioned. 

39As earlier stated the murder is, within that offence, at the lowest end of the scale. That is not to underestimate the enormity of the loss of life and the loss to the deceased's family or friends. But, on the evidence in these proceedings, one of the co-offenders, not Mr Jubraeel, was primarily responsible for that. 

40I have heard the Victim Impact Statements and acknowledge the tragic loss that can never by replaced. Mr Wick's family and friends can never again enjoy his company and his support and have been denied the enjoyment of his full life. 

41I have had regard to sentences imposed on other persons for similar offences. My attention was drawn, particularly, to my own judgment in R v Smith [2012] NSWSC 1565. There are differences between the situation pertaining to Mr Jubraeel and that which pertained to Mr Smith. Mr Smith never intended to perpetrate any violence (like Mr Jubareel), but also never intended to participate in the robbery, other than by driving with the co-offenders, pointing out the address in question and sought, albeit too late for culpability purposes, to withdraw from the offence. 

42Nevertheless, the foregoing judgment in Smith is a guide to the sentence to be imposed if consistency in sentencing were to be applied.

43More relevant for present purposes is the sentence imposed on Mr Jubraeel's co-offender, Mr Safar. No two offenders are identical. 

44Mr Safar was aware of the presence of a gun earlier in the commission of the offence than can be proved in relation to Mr Jubraeel, thereby marginally increasing the culpability in the case of Mr Safar, simply because it gave him a greater opportunity to assess the situation and withdraw from the commission of the offence. 

45Nevertheless, Mr Safar had a better criminal record. 

46Having stated that, Mr Jubraeel's criminal record was for an armed robbery when aged under eighteen in circumstances that were perceived by the court, at the time, not to be that serious and for which he received a suspended sentence. The offence was also committed in circumstances of joint criminal enterprise. 

47Further, Mr Safar, the co-offender, did not have the same degree of traumatic upbringing as was the situation for Mr Jubraeel; nor suffer the intellectual disability. 

48Of course, the fundamental distinction, is that Mr Safar, the co-offender, pleaded guilty and received a discount for that late plea of 12.5%. 

49There is, for the offence of murder, a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 20 years' imprisonment. Each of the foregoing is a guidepost in fixing a sentence to be imposed on Mr Jubraeel. As earlier stated, I consider that the offence in question, particularly as a result of the very late realisation by Mr Jubraeel of the presence of a gun, the limited time during which he would have had to withdraw from the offence (particularly having regard to his cognitive ability) and the lack of an intention by Mr Jubraeel to harm the victim, is at the lowest end of culpability within the very serious range that is associated with the crime of murder. I also take account of the circumstance that the Crown has not proved that the co-offender (as yet unknown) who shot the victim did so with an intent to kill or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 

50Apart from that, as earlier stated, I consider that Mr Jubraeel has sound prospects for rehabilitation, if he were to continue to abstain from drugs and alcohol. I take account of his past offending only to the extent that it disentitles Mr Jubraeel to the leniency associated with a first time offender. I do take account of the prior offence in assessing both the prospects of rehabilitation and the need for personal deterrence, together with what may be said to be a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law: see Veen v R (No. 2) at [477]. 

51Lastly, as earlier stated, I take into account the sentence imposed on Mr Jubraeel's co-offender, and note the differences between them to which I have already made reference. I commence the sentence to be imposed on a date taking account of the period of pre-sentence custody for this offence. 

Sentence

52Marwan Jubraeel, you are convicted of murder in that, on or about 23 July 2011 at Canley Heights in the State of New South Wales, you did murder Colin Wick. 

53For that offence, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 years' imprisonment, commencing 11 January 2012 and concluding 10 January 2024, with a remainder of term of 5 years' imprisonment, concluding 10 January 2029. 

54You are first eligible for release on parole on 10 January 2024.

2764168,The Council of the City of Sydney v Trico Constructions Pty Ltd [2014] NSWLEC 75,"Judgment
Introduction
1The parties to this Class 5 prosecution are in dispute about the correct construction and application of at least one specific provision in the pre-trial disclosure provisions contained in Division 2A of Part 5 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
2The Council has charged the defendant company, under s 125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979, with a breach of s 76A of that Act by doing work (demolition of a heritage listed ceiling), permissible only with development consent, without first obtaining such consent.  The defendant has pleaded ""Not guilty"".
3The application of Division 2A to Class 5 summary criminal proceedings in this Court was the subject of definitive analysis and commentary by Biscoe J in Sutherland Shire Council v Benedict Industries Pty Ltd (""Benedict"") [2013] NSWLEC 121.
4I need not set out all the provisions in the Division, nor the whole of his Honour's explanation of them, but I adopt his Honour's reasoning, noting that Judges must apply those provisions with caution, because they seriously abrogate the traditional right of silence enjoyed by an accused.
5The actual problem which has arisen in the present case was not before Biscoe J, and it is important that it be resolved by a considered judgment, even though the present parties may be close to a solution of their differences (see defendant's subs, par 18, and Tp9, LL28 - 46).
The Provisions, and the facts of the present dispute
6The relevant Division came into force in 2012, and comprises ss 247A - 247Y.  The stated objective of it is to ""reduce delays"" (s 247B(1)), essentially by narrowing the scope of disputed issues to ""what really matters"", namely those issues ""genuinely in dispute"", so that the ""real issues in dispute are determined without undue delay or expense"" (Attorney General's ""Statement in Principle"" speech - see Benedict at [5]).
7In the present matter the parties served their ""first round of disclosure statements"" (under ss 247E and 247F), as required by the Court's ""first"" directions of 6 September 2013, and the defendant entered its ""Not guilty"" plea.  
8The prosecutor then filed additional affidavits - from a planner and a fire engineer - but the defendant quickly signified its objection to the prosecutor's reliance upon them.
9Negotiation and resolution of that objection delayed the ""second round"" disclosures (under ss 247J, 247K and 247L), until after that objection was resolved.  Such disclosures are discretionary in character, but had been directed by the Court on 15 November 2013, over the opposition of the defendant.  
10The objection of the defendant to the ""late"" evidence was subsequently resolved ""by consent"".  Biscoe J made the relevant orders and directions on 10 February 2014.  The prosecutor served its s 247J notice on that day, but Craig J varied the timetable on 7 March 2014.
11The defendant responded with its s 247K notice on 8 April 2014, and part of that response ignited the question presently before the Court.
12Section 247K relevantly provides (emphasis added):
""... the notice of the defence response is to contain the following:
...
(f) a copy of any report, relevant to the proceedings, that has been prepared by a person whom the defendant intends to call as an expert witness at the hearing of the proceedings,
...""
13The defendant's s 247K notice responded to paragraph (f) in the following terms:
'None. No such report exists.  The Defendant intends to call expert evidence.  A report will be provided pursuant to s247O as soon as it is prepared in accordance with the Defendant's legal obligations under that section.'
14Section 247O relevantly provides (again emphasis added):
Disclosure requirements are ongoing
(1) The obligation to comply with the requirements for preliminary disclosure imposed by or under this Division continues until any of the following happens:
(a) the defendant is acquitted of the charges to which the proceedings relate,
(b) the prosecution is terminated,
(c) the defendant is sentenced for the offence to which the proceedings relate.
(2) Accordingly, if any information, document or other thing is obtained or anything else occurs after preliminary disclosure is made by a party to the proceedings that would have affected that preliminary disclosure had the information, document or thing been obtained or the thing occurred before preliminary disclosure was made, the information, document, thing or occurrence is to be disclosed to the other party to the proceedings as soon as practicable.
(see Benedict at [17])
15The defendant told the Court (Biscoe J), on 10 February, of its intention to call expert evidence.  That intention was repeated in its s 247K notice ([13] above), and the defendant has not changed its position in this respect since.  
16However, as at the date of the hearing before me (2 May 2014), the defendant had not only not received an expert's report, but it had not yet briefed a relevant expert (Tp8, LL1 - 3).  Accordingly, there is, self-evidently, not yet any expert report to disclose, pursuant to s 247K(f).
17Mr Howard SC, for the prosecutor, noted (Tp8, LL5 - 15 - emphasis mine):
""There's been no explanation advanced as far as I'm aware of why the defendant hasn't briefed an exert, but what the Court knows is that it's got an intention to call it.  We now know that the defendant is going to provide an expert report it says in some weeks down the track.  I'll leave that to my learned friend but it really beg the question of whether there has been a decision by the defendant, a forensic decision taken to defer the briefing of the expert in order to avoid disclosure requirements under subparagraph (f) and again I'm not saying that in a way to suggest that that would be in any way improper but what I am suggesting is that that would in effect frustrate the Court's case management role and the purposes of division 2A.""
18He asks the Court (Tp4, LL20 - 25) to ""reasonably draw the inference that [the defence] is delaying the briefing of its expert ""to avoid"" the disclosure that's contemplated by [s 247K(f)]"".  
Competing Submissions
19The prosecutor argues (Tp5, LL13 - 26) that s 247K(f) is not intended to give the defendant ""a unilateral discretion to just defer the briefing of an expert"", but that it imposes an obligation, once it discloses its intention to call expert evidence, to brief an expert, obtain the report and serve it.  Such an approach by the defendant enables it to dictate the timing of the proceedings.
20However, the Division goes on to require, in s 247L(a), that ""if the defendant has disclosed an intention to adduce expert evidence at the hearing of the proceedings, notice as to whether the prosecutor disputes any of the expert evidence and, if so, in what respect"".  The prosecutor says (Tp7, LL11 - 18) that, in the present situation, it cannot comply with that requirement, and (LL29 - 47) that the defendant is undermining the Court's case management function:
"" ... section 247K (f) would only have work to do if a defendant decides to disclose, not whether the Court orders it.  So the defendant can simply avoid it by not preparing the report and will be only be according to my learned friend's advanced construction of the section if it in fact prepares a report and happens to have it prepared at the time that the obligation to disclose under 247K crystallises.""
21The prosecutor, therefore, asks the Court to order (subs par 15) ""that the defendant must file and serve any expert report upon which it proposes to rely by 4pm on [a date to be fixed by the Court]"".  
22Mr Howard also put to the Court (Tp8, LL30 - 34): 
""Alternatively, your Honour, it would presumably suffice if the Court were to make a finding that s 247K(f) extends a properly construed important obligation on a defendant who intends to call expert evidence to produce a report by way of a preliminary disclosure under that section.""  
23The defendant argues (Tp10, LL4 - 5) that such a direction is ultra vires, in the absence of the defendant consenting, because the defendant has a ""common law right of non-disclosure that can only be abrogated by clear words on the part of the legislature"".
24The prosecutor says that Div 2A gives the Court the necessary power, but the defendant says (subs par 5, and Tp10, LL12 - 17) that it would require the Court to read into s 247K(f), words which do not occur there, either expressly or by necessary implication.  Section 247K(f) does NOT say (as the prosecutor contends at par 5 of its subs that it should be construed as saying) that the defendant ""if it intends to adduce expert evidence, must arrange for any expert report to be prepared and served as part of its preliminary disclosure in its s 247K notice"".
25The defendant remains entitled to put the prosecutor to proof of its case, and the section does not deprive the defendant of its right to retain/brief experts whenever it chooses to do so in the course of the proceedings, even if, by doing so, it risks the consequences of ""an adjournment and costs"" (Tp10, LL27 - 32).
26Mr C Ireland, counsel for the defendant, would distinguish Benedict, which concerned supplementary evidence, not expert evidence, but he relied upon the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision in NSW Food Authority v Nutricia Australia (""Nutricia"")[2008] NSWCCA 252; (2008) 72 NSWLR 456.
27In that matter, Spigelman CJ, with whom Hidden and Latham JJ agreed, said (at [159]) that, "" ... absent a clear statement that the accusatory system is to be abrogated, a statutory power should be read as not authorising steps to compel an accused, the subject of extant charges, to provide information for purposes of those proceedings"", and (at [161]), that "" ... Parliament should be taken not to have intended to impinge upon the accusatory nature of our system of criminal justice, after charges are lain, in the absence of express words or necessary intendment"".  
28Biscoe J referred to Nutricia in his analysis in Benedict (at [6]), even though it concerned a different statutory regime.
29Mr Ireland submits (pars 9 - 15) that the words of s 247K(f) are plain and clear, and that s 247B(a) makes clear that the provisions in the Division are intended to be quite specific, and not subject to broad implication.  The direction of the Court specifically sought disclosure of the defence response ""in accordance with"" s 247K.  Nothing in s 247N requires a party to retain an expert and serve the report with the s 247K notice.  He also denies (pars 16 and 17) the assertion that he is subverting the case management regime: "" ... when the Defendant identifies, retains, and commissions a report from an expert and secures that report that it intends to rely on at trial, then it will have an obligation to serve it on the Prosecutor, and the Defendant will do so"".
30The prosecutor's attempts to read additional words into s 247K(f), in the absence of ambiguity (par 21), ""would have the invidious effect of further abrogating defendants' rights to non-disclosure beyond the strict limits placed by Parliament"" on such abrogation.  No ""overarching general [case] management power"" arises until the hearing commences (see s 247V).
31Mr Ireland explained (in par 18) the defendant's delay, on the basis of Council's ""substantial delays in producing the fire safety files ... germane to this proposed expert evidence"" - Biscoe J had ordered their production by 21 February, and Craig J extended that date to 14 March.  Mr Ireland went on to indicate that the defendant's expert evidence might hopefully be available within four to five weeks (after 30 April, or after the time at which the defendant chooses to engage its expert).  
32He declined (par 22) to consent to a timetable being imposed by the Court on the filing and service of that evidence, and submitted that there is no general power conferred on the Court to order disclosure prior to the commencement of the trial.  The s 247K notice having earlier been given, the general s 247O(2) obligation to disclose will cut in when the expert report becomes available to the defendant - the section requires that follow-up disclosure ""as soon as practicable"".  The matter can then proceed towards its trial in the normal way, given that the defendant expects to maintain its ""not guilty"" plea, whatever the report says (Tp17, LL24 - 33).
33The hearing before me then proceeded to debate a timeframe, and the implications of that for the necessity for the Court to rule on the present dispute (see Tpp17 - 18).  
34The defendant pressed (Tp19 - 20) for the present issue about the scope for mandatory directions to be determined, but in the normal course of delivering reserved judgments: there is no question of public safety involved in the case, and no degree of urgency has been identified on either side, even though the defendant was resisting a court-imposed timeframe, and considering, in any event, the engagement of an expert whom it may choose to call at the hearing.
Conclusion
35I have come to the view that Mr Ireland's submissions are clearly to be preferred. 
36When such a fundamental right as that of an accused to silence is abrogated by statute, the Court should not read the statute so expansively as to dictate how the defendant will prepare its response to prosecution evidence - it dictates only that parties must give proper notice to each other prior to the hearing.
37The delay in the defendant's following-up the preliminary disclosure has been explained [31], partly on the basis of delay on the prosecutor's behalf, and Mr Howard expressly disavows any allegation of improper motivation [17] on the defendant's part.
38The s 247K process is at an end, and the defendant has assured the Court that it will abide by s 247O when its expert report is available.
39I, therefore, decline to make the order sought by the prosecutor ([21] above), and, because s 247O, rather than s 247K, applies at this stage, I also decline to make the alternative finding Mr Howard suggested (in [22] above).

2764171,R v Thaidy (1) [2014] NSWDC 193,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Yesterday on 23 June 2014 the Crown presented an indictment against Patrick Christopher Thaidy. The indictment contained two counts which were laid in the alternative. The accused had previously elected for trial by judge alone and so, after satisfying myself that the election had been properly made and granting the leave that was required, I proceeded to hear the trial.

2Before I discuss the evidence in the case and the issues which arose, I will set out some preliminary matters. They are the sorts of things that I would tell a jury if a jury was deciding whether Mr Thaidy was guilty or not on count 1 on the indictment. 

3I will determine all the relevant issues of fact according to the evidence. The evidence in this case was made up of what witnesses said in court and the exhibits which have been tendered. I have made no inquiries of any kind about anything that came up in this trial. 

4Although I had the benefit of seeing the witnesses give their evidence, I fully appreciate that in many cases it is extraordinarily difficult to assess whether a witness is telling the truth or not from the way the person behaves whilst giving evidence. This is especially the case where witnesses are not strangers to the witness box, such as the three police officers called by the Crown. 

5I need not decide all matters of fact which are disputed. What I must be satisfied of are the elements of the offence. The Crown has to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case the accused made admissions which reduced the matters in dispute considerably.

6The accused gave evidence in his trial. He did not have to do so. By giving evidence he did not assume a burden of proving that what he said was true. The burden of proof remains on the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. It is also important to remember that rejection of the accused's case, even beyond a reasonable doubt, is not the equivalent of proving the Crown case beyond a reasonable doubt. 

7I have decided this case coldly and unemotionally. Were there a jury, I would instruct them to ignore any feelings of sympathy or any other emotion that they might feel in deciding whether or not the accused is guilty of the charge he faces. Both the Crown and the accused are entitled to my judgment free from prejudice and sympathy. In particular, I know that the accused committed an offence of break, enter and steal that evening. That is why the police wished to apprehend him. That is why the accused, as he admits, drove away from the scene in an effort to avoid being apprehended, but I have not allowed this circumstance to affect my reasoning in a manner which is not a logical process of reasoning. 

8There was much that was not in dispute in the trial. Indeed the accused made a number of admissions which limited the issues to be decided. 

9The accused went with two other men to a small shopping centre in Cardiff South. There they broke into a hairdressing salon where they stole a small amount of cash, scissors and razors. Their actions had been observed by a neighbour and police were called. Police officers in two cars responded. They drove into the car park of the shopping centre. At this stage the accused and the two other men left the salon and got into a maroon Commodore sedan parked just outside. The accused got into the driver's seat, with the two others getting into the rear seat. 

10One of the police officers who responded, Sergeant David Lewis, got into the front passenger seat and grabbed hold of the hoodie the accused was wearing. He gave evidence that he held the hoodie at the scruff of the neck where the hood joins the back of that garment. 

11Another officer, Senior Constable Robert Ballard, went to the driver's side door. Senior Constable Ballard attempted to prevent the accused starting the car and, when that was unsuccessful, he attempted to turn the car off. However, there was no ignition, the car having been started through the use of a pair of scissors. After the car started the accused must have depressed the accelerator to a significant extent because both police officers gave evidence, which was unchallenged, that they heard the engine revving loudly and smoke coming up from under the bonnet. 

12Eventually, while Sergeant Lewis was still in the car the accused managed to put the automatic transmission lever into gear, causing the car to accelerate. Senior Constable Ballard leapt out of the way and the car drove off. The evidence of Sergeant Lewis was that in the course of the car accelerating harshly he was flung over the passenger seat into the rear compartment of the car. The accused agrees that the officer ended up there but says that this only occurred later. This is an issue to which I will return.

13In any case, the accused drove the car out of the car park, turned left and then left again until he was on Helen Street. The car then proceeded down Helen Street at high speed. Both police officers gave evidence, about which they were not cross-examined, that it appeared to be travelling above the speed limit. The car swerved from side to side, colliding with gutters and a street sign, before it failed to negotiate a right-hand turn, going through a fence and ending up in someone's yard. 

14Senior Constable Ballard had returned to his vehicle as soon as the Commodore was heading out of the shopping centre car park and followed it down Helen Street. After it eventually stopped he opened the driver's door and arrested the accused. 

15It is these circumstances which give rise to the two counts on the indictment. Count 1, to which the accused pleaded not guilty, alleged that while in company of others he used an offensive weapon, namely, a Holden Commodore motor vehicle, with the intent to prevent his lawful apprehension. Count 2, to which the accused pleaded guilty, laid as an alternative to count 1, alleged that the accused assaulted Sergeant Lewis, a police officer acting in the execution of his duty, and by the assault occasioned actual bodily harm to him. 

16The issue for me to decide is whether I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty on count 1. In doing so I take note of the admissions made by the accused under s 184(1) of the Evidence Act that he drove the maroon Commodore from the scene to get away and prevent his lawful apprehension. This narrows the relevant issues considerably. There was no admission in that document that he was in company at the time but, given the circumstances described by Sergeant Lewis, and the absence of any submission from Mr Bickford who appeared for the accused that the accused was not in company, I am able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in company at the relevant time.

17That leaves for me to decide the question which was identified at the very beginning of this trial as being the live issue. Am I satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused used the Commodore as an offensive weapon? 

18The Crown case is that the accused swerved the car from side to side in a violent manner as a means of attacking Sergeant Lewis by causing him to be thrown around in the back seat, colliding with things inside the car as that occurred. The Crown case is that the accused was attempting to cause Sergeant Lewis to release his hold on the accused's hoodie so as to either make it possible for Sergeant Lewis to be ejected from the car or so as to allow the accused to run away from Sergeant Lewis after the car stopped. That is how the Crown put its case that the car was an offensive weapon.

19The Crown also said that the case could be made out by considering the actions of the accused in so far as they caused Senior Constable Ballard to have to get out of the way. However, I could not find the accused guilty on this alternative basis. The evidence did not establish that the accused used the car to attack that officer. It established only that he intended to get away from him. 

20That leaves me to decide whether the Crown case is made out in so far as it concerns the actions of the accused towards Sergeant Lewis. 

21Relevantly, the definition of ""offensive weapon"" in s 4 of the Crimes Act provides that an offensive weapon is:

""anything that in the circumstances is used for offensive purposes, whether or not it is ordinarily used for offensive purposes or is capable of causing harm"". 

22There are, of course, authorities which deal with the issue as regards the use of a motor vehicle as an offensive weapon, in particular when the motor vehicle is used to prevent lawful apprehension. The only case I need to refer to is that of R v Hamilton (1993) 66 ACrimR 575. In that case, as is more usually the case, the motor vehicle was used by a person who drove it towards a police officer who was attempting to arrest him. Gleeson CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, held that:

""The adjective 'offensive' means something that is adopted or used for the purpose of attack. The question whether an object or an article is an offensive instrument raises for consideration the nature of the object, the uses of which it is capable and the intention of the person who is using it on the occasion in question. An object which in its nature and in its ordinary use is not offensive may become an offensive instrument by reason of the use to which a person puts it and the intent which accompanies such use."" 

23A motor car is of course an object which in its nature and in its ordinary use is not offensive but, as in Hamilton, the Crown argues that it was used for the purposes of attack and thus when used in that manner it became an offensive weapon. The Crown case is that when I look at the use to which the car was put and the intention of the accused which accompanied such use, the car became an offensive weapon.

24As I mentioned, Hamilton is an example where the accused drove the vehicle in a way which risked a collision between the car and a police officer who was outside the car. Usually in cases of this kind the police officer is outside the car and the car is used as a weapon by it being driven in a way which establishes the driver's intent that the police officer will come into contact with the outside of the car or, at the very least, cause the police officer to move so that such a collision does not occur. As a matter of legal principle, however, it makes no difference where, as in the present case, the police officer is inside the car and it is driven in such a way that the police officer comes into contact with parts of the inside of the car as he is thrown up and down and from side to side. 

25The Crown alleges that that is what occurred in the present case. It is common ground that as the car was being driven down Helen Street by the accused the police officer was holding onto part of the clothing then being worn by the accused. The Crown case is that the accused needed, if he was going to get away, to break that grip. He needed the police officer to let go of his clothing so that either the police officer could be ejected from the car or the accused could run away unhindered after he brought the car to a stop. The Crown case is that the accused deliberately swerved from side to side, driving the car in a very violent manner in order to cause harm to the police officer, thereby in turn causing him to break his grip. 

26The accused's case is quite different. He effectively blames the police officer for causing the car to move from side to side. He says that the police officer was hitting him from the back seat. He says that the police officer's grip on his clothing caused the car to swerve from side to side. He says that the police officer grabbed the steering wheel. He says that when the police officer put his feet through the gap between the bucket seats and kicked at the steering wheel and his hands, that also caused the car to swerve from side to side. In effect, the accused is prepared to accept responsibility for that part of the control of the vehicle which involves the foot pedals but says, in effect, that he was unable to control the direction of the car because of the police officer's interference. Thus he denies in effect being responsible for the swerving motion which the Crown says demonstrates the use of the car as an offensive weapon.

27As I mentioned earlier, there is a dispute as to when the officer went from the front passenger seat to the back seat. The officer himself, Sergeant Lewis, said that this occurred when the vehicle accelerated harshly at the beginning of the accused's attempt to avoid apprehension. Sergeant Lewis says that at that time he was on his knees in the front passenger seat, off balance, and the force of the violent acceleration meant that he was effectively moved backwards in the car, going over the top of the front passenger seat. 

28The accused, on the other hand, says that the police officer remained in the front passenger seat for a significantly longer time, claiming that it was only the side-to-side swerving motion whereby the car collided with the gutters that caused the police officer to go into the back seat. 

29I have no hesitation at all in accepting beyond a reasonable doubt that the police officer's version of events in this regard is correct. Swerving from side to side with a car colliding with the gutters would cause objects within the car to also move from side to side. It would have no tendency to cause things within the car to move in a fore and aft motion. A body at rest tends to remain at rest unless a force acts upon it. Thus when the accused accelerated the car harshly to get away from Senior Constable Ballard the car moved but Sergeant Lewis would tend to remain in the same position in space. To be precise, it was not a case of him moving backwards but the car moving forwards. The accused's version provides no explanation as to why Sergeant Lewis would move from the front seat to the back seat. Sergeant Lewis' version clearly does. 

30Thus I find that Sergeant Lewis was in the back seat of the car from virtually the moment the accused put the car into gear and drove off. This is a significant finding as it suggests that the cause of the swerving was not anything that Sergeant Lewis did from the front seat.

31Another aspect of the evidence worthy of comment concerns the officer's use of his firearm. Sergeant Lewis gave evidence that in fear of his life he withdrew his firearm from its holster with his right hand and contemplated shooting the accused. The accused agrees that the officer at one stage withdrew his firearm, claiming to have seen it when he turned around and looked at the officer in the course of the car's travel down Helen Street. Sergeant Lewis gave evidence that he re-holstered his firearm and decided not to shoot the driver because he saw that they were travelling too dangerously. He said that, ""Discharging a firearm was probably no safer than the way we were driving."" 

32The officer, I thus accept, was genuinely frightened at the way the car was travelling down the roadway, swerving violently from side to side. Such a person is most unlikely to be the cause of the vehicle's erratic path, as is claimed by the accused. I am satisfied that Sergeant Lewis was genuinely afraid for his life. If the accused's version of events is correct, all Sergeant Lewis would have had to have done to make his situation safer would be to stop interfering with the direction the car was travelling. To put matters bluntly, on the accused's version that would have decreased the likelihood that Sergeant Lewis would die. The car would have travelled in a straight line, not swerving from side to side. So the fact that the car was driven erratically from the moment it moved off until it came to rest tends to suggest that the accused's version of events cannot be accepted. 

33This, of course, is not to reverse the onus of proof. As I have mentioned before and as I will mention below, the Crown bears the onus of proving the guilt of the accused, but in assessing whether that has been done, it is important to assess all the evidence in the case including that given by an accused person. When I perform that task and analyse the evidence given by this accused, I find that in significant areas it cannot be accepted.

34Another aspect of the evidence which points very much in favour of the Crown case being accepted is this circumstance. The accused never claimed that the officer did anything to affect the accused's operation of the foot pedals: the accelerator and the brake. It is clear that the vehicle was travelling at high speed. Tyre burn marks were photographed by police. Two police officers gave evidence that they heard the engine revving loudly and saw smoke coming out of the bonnet of the car. Had the swerving of the car from side to side been something that the accused did not desire and which gave him concerns for his own safety, it would have been a simple matter for him to have slowed down or even stopped. Of course, had he done so he would have been inhibited from escaping from police because Sergeant Lewis would still have hold of his clothing. That, in my view, explains why the accused travelled at high speed and is a further reason for accepting that the swerving from side to side came about as a result of a voluntary action of the accused. 

35The accused's claim that Sergeant Lewis was at one stage actually grabbing the steering wheel with his hands cannot be accepted for at least three reasons. Firstly, it would have been physically impossible, given the position Sergeant Lewis was in, to have reached all the way from the back seat to the steering wheel. Secondly, at all times he had hold of the accused's hoodie with his left hand. It would have been physically impossible for him to have grabbed the steering wheel with his right at any time. And thirdly, and this is related to something I said earlier, such an action is inconsistent with the officer's fear that he might even be killed as a result of the path the car was taking.

36I do not accept either that the officer having hold of the hoodie was in any way the cause of the erratic path. The officer was not shaking the hoodie from side to side, merely holding onto it. Nor was any other action of the officer likely to have contributed to the car swerving from side to side. In particular, his actions in kicking the steering wheel and the accused's hands only came about quite late in the piece, a matter the accused concedes. So the result is that no action of the officer caused the swerving on which the Crown relies. 

37I mentioned before the difficulties of assessing the truthfulness of a witness from that witness' appearance in the witness box, especially in the case of practised witnesses such as police officers. Even approaching this aspect of the case with considerable caution, I remain of the view that the demeanour of the witnesses in the witness box in this case is also a factor on which the Crown is entitled to rely. I can confidently say that I would still have reached the same conclusion in any case but I mention this aspect of the case because of the stark nature of the demeanour of the witnesses, particularly the accused, whilst giving evidence. Sergeant Lewis appeared to give evidence thoughtfully and carefully. He made appropriate concessions. He appeared to think before answering. On the contrary, the accused, especially in cross-examination, appeared to be anxious to say the first thing that came into his mind. He did not appear to be willing to listen to questions put to him or even to give very much thought to them. In any case, he appeared to have adopted the attitude that he would simply deny propositions put to him by the crown prosecutor. This led to the situation where, as I perceived it, the accused was denying any responsibility for any of the injuries caused to Sergeant Lewis, a position quite inconsistent with the accused's plea of guilty to count 2 on the indictment. 

38That led in turn to a question as to whether the accused's plea of guilty to count 2 had evidentiary significance in my assessment of the reliability of the accused's evidence in determining whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty on count 1. I heard submissions on the matter but, as it is not necessary for me to resolve that matter to decide this case, I have decided that the safer option is not to treat the accused's plea of guilty to count 2 as having any evidentiary relevance to my determination on count 1. 

39I also accept that giving evidence is a very stressful experience and that many people in the witness box are anxious to disagree with propositions put to them by the cross-examiner. However, even with that qualification, I would, if it was necessary to do so, have taken the demeanour of the witnesses into account in deciding that I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt on count 1.

40I should now deal with some specific arguments put by Mr Bickford on behalf of the accused. He pointed out, accurately, that there was no other evidence of an attack by the accused on either police officer. For example, there was no evidence that the accused punched Sergeant Lewis at any time. That is, of course, a matter on which the accused is entitled to rely, tending to suggest, as it does, that it was not the accused's intention to inflict violence upon Sergeant Lewis. I have taken that factor into account.

41Mr Bickford also points out that no one was wearing a seatbelt and so that all of the people in the car that day, including the person driving, the accused, were vulnerable to danger. But, of course, the accused had an object to achieve and that was to escape police and sometimes risks have to be taken because of the perceived need. Thus whilst it is clearly the case that the accused's manner of driving risked his own safety and that of the other two men in the car, as well as Sergeant Lewis, this is not a factor that I have found terribly important. 

42In any case, Sergeant Lewis was particularly vulnerable. The accused was sitting in a correct position in the driver's seat. He was holding onto the steering wheel. He was in a much better position to resist the violent swerving motions of the car than anyone else in the car. Sergeant Lewis was particularly vulnerable, lying effectively across the knees at one stage of the two men in the back with both hands at one stage and one hand at another stage holding onto the accused's hoodie. The submission that the accused's manner of driving risked his own safety has to be looked at with that factor in mind as well.

43Mr Bickford made the submission that it was Sergeant Lewis' grip on the hoodie which may have actually caused the swerving. I have already dealt with this aspect to some extent in my reasons for judgment delivered so far but let me say again: if that was the case, why did the accused not stop? Sergeant Lewis was not shaking the hoodie from side to side, merely holding onto it. Any movement from side to side would have been caused by the accused himself as he swerved, not causing the swerving in the first place. 

44And finally, and this is something I have mentioned at least twice before, Sergeant Lewis was concerned for his own safety. I have got no hesitation in accepting, as I mentioned earlier, that Sergeant Lewis was frightened and feared for his own life. If it was his grip on the hoodie that was causing the problem with the car's path, it would have been a very simple matter for him to have increased the likelihood that he would survive the episode by simply releasing his grip.

45Mr Bickford points out that there is more damage on the right-hand side, namely, the side of the vehicle where the accused was sitting, than on the left-hand side of the car. That appears to be the case, although there is not that much in it. In any case, it would not be surprising if the accused was not fully in control of the car. The extensive tyre burn marks, the fact that he was swerving the vehicle from side to side violently, the fact that at one stage he was on the grass all suggest the unlikelihood that the accused was perfectly in control of the motor vehicle as it drove down Helen Street. 

46Of course, the ultimate intention of the accused was to escape the police. To make the obvious point, an intention to escape is not inconsistent with an intention to escape by using the car as an offensive weapon. I am satisfied that the swerving on which the Crown relies was a deliberate action by the accused and that the only explanation for it was the presence of Sergeant Lewis in the car. That is a significant aspect in the Crown proving that the accused's intention was to attack Sergeant Lewis. Sergeant Lewis gave evidence that he collided with the ceiling of the car as well as the sides. He was clearly harmed as a result. To harm Sergeant Lewis or at least to frighten him must have been the accused's intention. There was no other reason for the accused to have violently swerved as he did.

47For these reasons, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused used the vehicle for the purposes of attack. He intended to injure or at the very least frighten Sergeant Lewis so that he would let go of the accused, thus making it easier for him to be ejected from the car or so that the accused would be able to run from the car when it stopped. I am thus satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the car was an offensive weapon.

48Given my findings on the other elements and in particular the accused's admissions to them, that conclusion means that my verdict on count 1 is one of guilty.

		13 November 2014",2014-06-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764177,R v RD [2014] NSWCCA 103,"Judgment

1WARD JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Hamill J and the additional observations of Fullerton J. I agree that for the reasons expressed by Hamill J the appeal should be allowed and I agree with the conclusions his Honour has reached on re-sentence. I also agree with the observations made by Fullerton J. Accepting that the respondent had a dysfunctional upbringing that has affected his development, these offences were nevertheless very serious and committed on a young child who was in a vulnerable position.

2FULLERTON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hamill J and gratefully acknowledge his Honour's review of the facts and his analysis of the evidence tendered on sentence and on re-sentence. I wish however to add the following remarks.

3For my part, even making due allowance for the fact that the sentencing reasons were delivered ex tempore, I find the sentencing judge's observations extracted at [34] of Hamill J's judgment difficult to understand. Irrespective of there being no evidence tendered on sentence as to the physical or emotional impact of the child having given birth to a premature infant by emergency caesarean section at age 13 and the child being removed from her and placed in the care of the Department, to describe the birth in those circumstances as a 'significant event in a 13 year old's life' is, in my view, a serious understatement of the impact of the respondent's offending. Whether or not those remarks contributed to the imposition of what I regard as a wholly inadequate sentence on Count 6 and whether they led to a wholly inadequate effective sentence is difficult to say. 

4I would also wish to emphasise that for my part neither the indicative sentences nor the aggregate sentence to be imposed on re-sentence should be taken as reflecting sentences that should have been imposed at first instance for what I regard as serious and repeated sexual abuse of a young child.

5HAMILL J: This is a Crown appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Berman SC in the District Court sitting at Newcastle on 25 November 2013. The respondent was sentenced in relation to 3 counts of having sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 14 years. Those are offences under s 66C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and they each carry a maximum penalty of 16 years imprisonment. On arraignment he pleaded not guilty to three counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent pursuant to 61J(1) Crimes Act (counts 1, 3 and 5) and guilty to the alternative counts under s 66C (counts 2, 4 and 6). The Crown accepted those pleas in full discharge of the indictment. 

6In the present case Judge Berman SC imposed a total effective sentence of three years. There was a total effective non-parole period of 18 months. This total sentence was achieved by imposing a fixed term of 18 months in relation to the first charge, a sentence of two years with a non-parole period of 12 months in relation to the second charge and a sentence of two years with a non-parole period of six months in relation to the third charge. The commencement dates of the sentences were staggered in order to achieve the total sentence by way of partial accumulation and partial concurrence. 

7The sentencing judge ordered that the non-parole period is to expire on 24 May 2015 upon which the offender is to be released on parole. This last order could only be made because the total sentence was one of three years or less: s 50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW); s 8 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW); R v Riddell [2000] NSWCCA 144.

8The appellant raises one ground of appeal, which is that ""the sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate"". In written and oral submissions the appellant asserts that the total effective sentence is manifestly inadequate, that the individual sentences in respect of each count are manifestly inadequate and that the degree of accumulation was inadequate. The appellant also submits that the learned sentencing judge erred in his approach to a particular factual circumstance to which it will be necessary to return. It is also asserted that the sentencing judge fell into error in providing the respondent with a discount of 20 per cent as a result of the ""utilitarian value"" of his plea of guilty. None of these specific errors are subject to any ground of appeal: contra Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 254 CLR 259 at [8].

9To appreciate the force of the appellant's submissions it is necessary to recount in full the agreed facts which were before the sentencing judge:
Background:
The victim was born December 1998. She was aged between 12 and 13 years of age at the time of these offences. The offender was born in December 1990. He was aged between 18 and 21 years of age at the time of the offences.

The victim lived with her mother, her older brother and her younger brother. Her uncle resided at the property in a caravan at the rear of the premises. The offender was best friends with the victim's older brother. In 2010, the offender moved into the home of the victim. The victim was 11 years of age when the offender moved in. From time to time, the offender's girlfriend also resided at the location with her child from a previous relationship. The offender, his girlfriend and his girlfriend's child shared a bedroom with the victim's older brother. The victim retained her own bedroom.

A few weeks after the offender moved into the victim's residence, the offender asked the victim, 'Do you want to go out with me?' The victim believed the accused was asking her to start a relationship with him. The victim, aged 11, said 'Yes'. Their 'relationship' involved hugging and they also kissed. The relationship involved the victim sleeping in the bed of the offender when his girlfriend was not home.

Count [2]:
Sexual Intercourse with Child (10-14 years)
S 66C(1) Crimes Act 
In late 2010 night, the victim (aged 12) and the offender (aged 18) were in the offender's bed. They were both under the bed covers, with no other persons present in the room. The victim's mother and brothers were inside the premises. The offender pulled the victim's pyjama pants and underwear down and 'spooned' the victim from behind, hugging her. From this position, he inserted his penis into the victim's vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. The sexual intercourse stopped after a few minutes. The victim left the room not long after. She did not disclose the incident to anyone.

Count [4]:
Sexual Intercourse with Child (10-14 years)
S 66C(1) Crimes Act
In October 2011, during the day, the victim was under the blankets in her bed in her own bedroom. The offender entered the victim's bedroom and got into bed with her. The offender pulled the victim's pyjama pants and underwear down. The offender got on top of the victim and inserted his penis into her vagina. The offender had sexual intercourse with the victim for a few minutes before stopping. At the time of this incident the victim was 12 years of age and the accused was 21 years of age. Following this incident, towards the end of 2011, the victim noticed her stomach was protruding and was concerned that she might be pregnant. The victim told the offender of her suspicion that she may be pregnant via text message, however, she was too scared to tell anyone else.

Count [6]:
Sexual Intercourse with Child (10-14 years)
S 66C(1) Crimes Act 
At around 10:30 pm on 19 May 2012, the victim was feeling tired, ill and experiencing stomach pains. That night, she slept in the offender's bed. The victim went to sleep lying on her side, with her back to the accused and the offender 'spooning' her. During the night the offender pulled her pyjamas and underwear down. The offender hugged the victim and rolled her on top of him and put his penis into her vagina. They continued to have intercourse for a few minutes. The victim got off the offender and put her pyjama pants back on. The Victim awoke at 4 am the next morning bleeding from her vagina. She woke her mother was taken to hospital by ambulance.

At the John Hunter Hospital, an ultrasound examination indicated that the victim was pregnant and she was taken to the delivery suite. Thereafter, her condition worsened as she was suffering a placental abruption, where the placenta prematurely comes away from the uterus. A caesarean section was performed and she gave premature birth to a boy estimated to be 30 weeks old. It is not suggested that the offender's behaviour caused the premature birth or any injury to the victim.

The Investigation:
Police from the Child Abuse Squad in Newcastle were informed of the birth on Sunday 20 May 2012. On 20 May 2012, the offender attended the hospital and visited the victim. The offender also maintained contact with the victim by mobile telephone. After initially denying the offences to the victim's mother, on 21 May 2012 the offender broke down in tears and said 'I've fucked up, I've fucked up' and admitted that he committed the offences.

Arrest:
On 23 May 2012, police made attempts to locate the offender. Police spoke directly with him by phone in the early hours of the morning. Several attempts were made by police to arrange a meeting with the offender without success. On 25 May 2012 the offender attended Newcastle Police Station. He was arrested and placed into custody. He declined to be interviewed but provided a DNA sample. He was later charged. On 10 July 2012, the victim attended the Newcastle Police Station where she participated in a further recorded interview outlining the offences before the court.

DNA Evidence:
On 9 October 2012, a Certificate of Analysis was prepared by the NSW Forensic and Analytical Science Service, in relation to a blood sample received from the infant and a buccal sample received from the offender. The report concluded that given the maternal DNA types passed on to the infant by the victim, it is approximately 16 million times more likely to obtain the paternal DNA types inherited by the infant if the offender is the father rather than an unknown, unrelated male in the general population.

The Child:
The newborn was released from hospital and is now under the care of The Department of Community Services.

10The facts were wrong in one respect. The respondent was 19 (not 18) at the time of the first offence and 20 (not 21) at the time of the second offence.

11It will readily be seen that the facts of this case are objectively extremely serious. A particularly troubling aspect of the matter is that the child victim became pregnant after the sexual intercourse alleged in the count (4). She told the respondent that she feared she may be pregnant but he took no action to assist her. He did not take her to a doctor or make any other arrangements for her. This meant that she endured the entire pregnancy without prenatal care, counselling or medical intervention. Not only did the respondent fail to do anything to assist the child with the pregnancy, he sexually abused her again. Count 6 was a further allegation of sexual intercourse (by penile vaginal penetration) over a number of minutes. It was in the aftermath of that incident that the child went into labour prematurely, giving birth at a nearby hospital early the following morning. 

12It must be remembered that the respondent was not to be sentenced for his failure to obtain medical treatment for the child when he learned that she might be pregnant. Nor was he charged with an offence concerning any injury or medical complications occasioned by the act of penetration constituting count (6). The facts made it clear that there was no allegation that his actions caused any injury or the premature labour. However, the fact that he knew, or at least suspected, that the child may be pregnant is a matter which seriously aggravates the respondent's moral culpability for, and the objective criminality of, the third offence.

13Mr Gartelmann, who appeared for the respondent on the appeal, acknowledged the seriousness of the offending but noted that the three incidents appeared to be isolated - they were not representative of a more extensive pattern of sexual abuse. He emphasised that the offending behaviour in each case took place over the course of 'only a few minutes'. He also noted that the age difference between the respondent and the victim was not as great as in many cases. 

14Even taking into account the matters put by Mr Gartelmann, against a maximum penalty of 16 years referable to each offence, the total sentence of three years with a non-parole period of 18 months appears to be extraordinarily lenient. 

15However, the respondent's counsel at first instance presented a compelling case regarding the respondent's personal circumstances. The respondent was a relatively young man himself. He was only 19 or 20 years of age at the time of the first offence, 20 years old at the time of the second offence and 21 years old at the time of the third offence. The evidence of a psychologist also suggests that he may have been an emotionally immature 20 year old. 

16A comprehensive psychological report under the hand of Dr Seidler (clinical psychologist) and dated 19 June 2013 set out the respondent's personal background. The learned sentencing judge commented that his background is ""easily described as dysfunctional"". This observation is a marked understatement of the deprivation and neglect of the respondent's upbringing. The report makes for fairly distressing reading. The respondent's home life was chaotic. The respondent's parents were both drug users and from time to time during the respondent's childhood they took foster children into the home. It seems that they did so in order to obtain income and government benefits. The respondent received very little guidance and attention. He was mostly unhappy at home and at times he ""was homeless and would 'walk the streets' to avoid being at home"". When the respondent was in his late teens, his mother became involved in a relationship with one of the foster children who was an adult by that time. As a result the respondent became estranged from his mother and became more influenced by his father and an older brother. It is clear on the evidence before this Court that the influence of the father and the brother was not a positive one. 

17Dr Seidler described the environment in which the respondent was raised as ""dysfunctional, chaotic and neglectful"" and said that the respondent was exposed to ""a number of risks known to compromise the development of a child"". Most profoundly, these risks affected the respondent's ""attachments"" so that ""he has grown into an isolated individual who does not trust or connect to others easily and his capacity for mature intimacy in relationships is compromised"". She repeated this opinion later in the report, where she described; 
""[A]bject parental neglect and substance abuse in addition to being raised in an overcrowded and disadvantaged family environment [which] resulted in [the respondent] being offered little in the way of direct care and supervision. This was increasingly so as he transitioned to adolescence when [the respondent's] lifestyle became more unstable and itinerant and he was afforded few, if any, limitations""

18The report notes that ""[the appellant] denied a history of sexual or physical abuse in which he was victimised"". 

19The respondent also had childhood illnesses (seizures), which he believed caused him to suffer ""brain damage"". Dr Seidler saw documents from a hospital which confirmed this history although the evidence could not sustain a finding that the respondent had ""brain damage"". He presented to Dr Seidler as ""an unsophisticated individual both intellectually and socially"". His ""speech was generally slow and monotonic and he maintained limited eye contact"". His ""pervasive mood was blunted"". Considering this evidence it must also be noted that the offender did not appear to present with any irrational thought processes and did not present with any diagnosable psychological or psychiatric illness. 

20Psychometric examinations were conducted. These showed that the respondent's general intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the ""low average range"" but Dr Seidler was of the opinion that this result did not accurately describe his level of functioning. This was because his ""verbal skills are substantially lower than his non-verbal skills"" and in one of the tests (vocabulary) the respondent scored higher than only 0.1% of his age peers.

21Whilst the examination and testing was inconsistent and, therefore, inconclusive, it is clear that the learned sentencing judge was dealing with a man of significant disadvantage both in terms of social deprivation and intellectual capacity. 

22The relevance of social deprivation and intellectual disability has been considered recently by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 and Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37 at [42] -[44]. The evidence does not allow for a conclusion that the respondent was ""mentally retarded"" as the High Court described the appellant in Muldrock v The Queen but his intellectual deficits remain relevant to the sentencing exercise. Further, the social deprivation and ""abject parental neglect"" that featured in the respondent's upbringing are matters of significance in an assessment of a just and appropriate punishment for his grave offending. 

23However, these matters were not capable of providing an explanation for his offences against the child victim in the present case. Dr Seidler said:
""I do not believe that any such deficit can explain [the respondent's] offending behaviour but would suggest that [the respondent] is someone who lacks insight and reflective capacity and his reasoning and ability to understand concepts presented verbally would be compromised and superficial.""

24Neither Mr Gartelmann nor counsel at first instance suggested that there was any direct causal link between the respondent's social deprivation and intellectual deficit and his offending behaviour. Accordingly, while the matters to which I have just referred are of real significance in determining an appropriate sentence, they do not diminish the respondent's moral culpability for his actions or diminish the objective seriousness of the offending.

25Dr Seidler assessed the respondent as being a ""moderate risk"" of re-offending. That opinion was based in part on the fact that his history including that had not been the victim of sexual abuse as a child. Further material tendered on sentence complicates that consideration. A psychologist report prepared by the Department of Corrective Services as part of the provision of a pre-sentence report assessed the respondent as being in the ""low to moderate risk"" of recidivism. 

26The case presented to Judge Berman SC gave rise to a particularly difficult and challenging sentencing exercise. More than in most cases, the principles of sentencing pulled in opposite directions. On the one hand the offending behaviour called for condign punishment. On the other hand the subjective circumstances of the respondent required such punishment to be tempered by compassion for his circumstances. It was open to the sentencing judge, given the respondent's age and circumstances and the fact that he had not previously come before the criminal courts, to come to the view that rehabilitation should play a prominent part in the sentencing exercise. Contrary to the submissions of the appellant, the fact that the respondent was assessed by Dr Seidler as a moderate risk of re-offending did not mean that personal deterrence should have played a more significant role. I accept Mr Gartelmann's submission that the fact that he was a first offender and had not previously been sentenced or breached conditional liberty meant that this was not a case where personal deterrence (beyond the fact of a full time gaol sentence) needed to be visited on the respondent. However, general deterrence remained a significant fact even though the respondent was not, perhaps, the most perfect vehicle through whom to send a message. 

27The ground of appeal raised by the appellant is simply that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. There is no ground of appeal asserting any specific error of law or principle. This is a matter discussed by the High Court in Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13 at [8]. In the end, the function of the court confronted with a ground of appeal alleging manifest inadequacy is to determine whether the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was ""unreasonable"", ""plainly unjust"", or ""manifestly wrong"": see, for example, Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 per Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [22].

28However, it is also appropriate that I consider the specific errors asserted by the appellant even though those errors have not been raised as grounds of appeal. As I understand the Crown's position, the errors identified led the sentencing judge to impose a manifestly inadequate sentence. 

29The first error concerns the assertion that the sentencing judge provided the respondent with an excessive discount for his plea of guilty. The respondent pleaded guilty on the day that his trial was listed. In those circumstances the sentencing judge's discount of 20 per cent appears to be too high: see, for example, R v Thomson and Houlten [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383; R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117; Sullivan v R [2008] NSWCCA 296; Krotiris v R [2012] NSWCCA 28. However, a perusal of the transcript and submissions made before the sentencing judge explain how Judge Berman SC came to conclude that a discount of 20 per cent was appropriate in the circumstances of the case. 

30In presenting the material to his Honour at the commencement of the case, the prosecutor indicated that the plea had been entered on the day of the trial but that there were discussions taking place prior to that ""and there was an offer made to plea in the Local Court"". The prosecutor said he would leave it to defence counsel to explain the circumstances. Defence counsel explained that there had been discussions about the plea for some considerable time and that it was only very close to the trial date that amendments to the indictment resulted in the respondent entering his plea of guilty. He said that the respondent had ""never really had an effective opportunity to enter that plea"". Judge Berman SC then asked defence counsel whether he contended that his client should get a 25 per cent discount. Defence counsel replied that he could not hope for a 25 per cent discount but that there were circumstances that should result in a discount of ""substantially higher than the 10 per cent that he'd get if you pleaded at trial"". In response to defence counsel's submissions, the prosecutor said that he did not ""cavil with what my friend has indicated as to the timing of the plea"" and did not make any submission that defence counsel was wrong when he submitted that the particular circumstances of the case were such that a discount ""substantially more than 10 per cent"" was warranted. 

31In the case of Sullivan v R [2008] NSW CCA 296, the appellant argued that a discount of 15 per cent was insufficient and that he should receive a discount of 20 per cent. Howie J said at [14];
""The short answer is that this court would not generally find that there was an error in the exercise of discretion in choosing a discount of 15 per cent rather than one of 20 per cent in particular where the judge gives reasons for determining the discount chosen"".

32While Judge Berman SC did not give reasons for his determination as to the appropriate discount at any great length, the record of the proceedings shows the reasons why he gave the discount he did. I can see no error of law or principle in the approach taken by the sentencing judge and it seems to me that the words of Howie J in Sullivan v R have equal application here. Plainly, a discount of substantially more than 10 per cent must have encompassed a discount of around 15 per cent or more. Accordingly, the argument put by the appellant involves a reasonably minor adjustment of a matter which was ultimately for the sentencing judge's discretion. 

33The next particular error asserted by the appellant is one of far greater substance and significance and is the factual matter to which I indicated at the outset it would be necessary to return. It involves a consideration of the rather opaque remarks made by Judge Berman SC in respect to the relevance of the child's pregnancy that resulted from the sexual intercourse alleged in count (4). Again, to understand those remarks it is necessary to consider the arguments which were advanced in the sentencing proceedings. Defence counsel had made a submission that it would be wrong to consider the pregnancy and birth of a child as an aggravating factor. He said that the sentence should not be increased as the result of the birth of a child and that there was some ""tension"" in considering that matter as an aggravating circumstance. On the other hand, the Crown's representative said ""this is a catastrophic result for a young girl and it cannot be said, in the Crown's submission, that the offender did not have true knowledge of her age"".

34It was in that context that Judge Berman SC made the following remarks:
""The form of sexual intercourse, penile vaginal intercourse, is traditionally regarded as one of the more serious forms of intercourse carrying with it, of course, a risk of disease and, as here, a risk of pregnancy. The offender's actions have caused a 13-year-old to give birth to a child. It is difficult to describe that as something which is harmful. It is certainly a significant event in a 13-year-old girl's life and while she may love the child, it is certainly a factor that I must take into account. Her life has been changed by the offender's behaviour and probably not for the better"".

35As I have said, these remarks are opaque. However it is clear that his Honour was concerned that he not take into account as a circumstance of aggravation the fact that a child had been born. The Crown Prosecutor in this Court very properly conceded that the remarks were made ex tempore and should not be subject to unduly close scrutiny. 

36However, there is a great deal of force to the appellant's submission that the circumstance was one which ought to have played a greater part in an assessment of the objective gravity of the criminality. This is particularly so with respect to count (6). It is in relation to that count that the respondent not only failed to assist the child when she thought she was pregnant, but again took advantage of her by having penile sexual intercourse with her, knowing or suspecting that she was pregnant. This was a particularly serious example of an offence under s 66C because of the circumstance of the victim's pregnancy, combined with her age and vulnerability.

37The Crown has also submitted that the sentencing judge's approach to accumulation and concurrence was unduly lenient. It has pointed to the fact that the extent of concurrency of the non-parole periods results in no additional punishment (at least in terms of the period the respondent will spend in gaol). However those sentences did increase the total term of the sentence. 

38Questions of the degree of accumulation and concurrency are matters that fall squarely within the discretionary judgment of the sentencing Judge: see for example R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 per Simpson J at [7]. The High Court said in Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 205 ALR 346; (2004) 78 ALJR 616:
""Judges at first instance should be afforded as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected"". 

39I accept Mr Gartelmann's submission that the sentencing judge applied the well-known statement of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 (at [45]): 
""A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality"". 

40The appellant also suggested that there was error in that the total effective non-parole period was only 50% of the total sentence and that the non-parole period imposed on count (6) was only 25% of the total sentence. However, it was acknowledged that the finding of ""special circumstances"" was correct (or at least open). The degree of departure from the proportions dictated by s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is a discretionary decision that raises ""so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court will be very slow to intervene"": R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; Trad v R (2009) 194 A Crim R 20 at [33]. I am unable to discern error in Judge Berman's approach to special circumstances and the proportion which applied to count (6) was largely the result of the partial accumulation of the sentence imposed on that count.

41However whilst no error of principle is disclosed, the approach taken by Judge Berman SC was a lenient application of the discretion in respect of accumulation, concurrence and special circumstances. Mr Gartelmann conceded that a manifestly inadequate total sentence may result from a combination of (1) individual sentences which are lenient, (2) a modest degree of accumulation, and (3) a significant adjustment of the proportion between non-parole period and balance of term.

42The issues for this Court are whether that is what has happened here and/or whether any of the individual sentences imposed are ""plainly wrong"" or ""manifestly inadequate or unjust"": cf Dinsdale v The Queen (supra).

43Neither party made reference to the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission or to any similar case. While I appreciate the limitation inherent in the process, I have consulted the relevant statistics. There are 82 cases of which 54 received full time sentences. The sentences imposed in those 54 cases range from 18 months to 10 years with the majority of cases (34) falling with the band of 2 ½ years to 4 ½ years. The problem with considering these statistics is that it is unlikely that many (if any) of the cases in the database involved a child become pregnant and the offender continuing to have sexual intercourse with her. The only case of which I am aware where pregnancy resulted is the case of R v Deer [2014] NSWDC 24. That was a case under s. 66C(2) (the child being 14-15 years old) with a maximum penalty of 10 years (as opposed to 16 years here). On the other hand there were four offences which were part of a pattern of ongoing sexual abuse ([8]). Aspects of the case (see for example at [15]) were particularly shocking. There was a finding that the victim had suffered substantial emotional harm and the offender was older and had a criminal record. An aggregate sentence of 8 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months was imposed. It is impossible to gain any guidance from one case which had a number of very different features. 

44In all of the circumstances of the present case, considering the extremely serious nature of the offending and the maximum penalty of 16 years, I have concluded that the both the individual sentences and the total effective sentence imposed are manifestly inadequate. I can see no basis upon which the sentence for count (6), which featured the particularly aggravating circumstance concerning the respondent's knowledge of the pregnancy, should have been the same as the sentence for count (4) and just six months more than the sentence imposed for count (2). Further, in my opinion, the total sentence of three years and the total non-parole period of 18 months fail adequately to reflect the totality of criminality involved in the three offences. 

45It is necessary therefore to consider whether the court might exercise its discretion not to intervene. 

46Section 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) 2001 (NSW) provides: 
""Double jeopardy not to be taken into account in prosecution appeals against sentence 

(1) An appeal court must not: 
(a) dismiss a prosecution appeal against sentence, or 
(b) impose a less severe sentence on any such appeal than the court would otherwise consider appropriate, 
because of any element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent being sentenced again. 
(2) This section extends to an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and accordingly a reference in this section to an appeal court includes a reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal.""

47The extent to which this provision circumscribes the ""residual discretion"" has been considered by this Court: see, for example, R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49, 77 NSWLR 7 per Spigelman CJ (with whom Allsop P agreed) at [92]-[95] and [141]; per McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ at [209] and R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66 per Basten JA at [21]-[26]. The High Court has also considered the exercise of the residual discretion in recent times: see, Green & Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ at [26], [43] and per Bell J at [131]; Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37;87 ALJR 1022 at [24].

48These cases establish that this Court retains a 'residual discretion' to decline to intervene to increase a sentence on a Crown appeal even where error is established and even when it concludes that the sentence imposed at first instances is plainly wrong or manifestly inadequate. 

49In Green and Quinn v The Queen the majority said at [35]-[36]:
""...assuming the Court of Criminal Appeal considers the sentence under appeal to be inadequate on account of error by the primary Judge, two questions arise. Their answers involve the exercise of the different discretions conferred by s 5D. They are:

1. Whether, notwithstanding the inadequacy of the sentence, the Court should decline in the exercise of its 'residual discretion' under s 5D, to allow the appeal and thereby interfere with the sentence appealed from. 

2.To what extent, if the appeal is allowed, the sentence appealed from should be varied. 

A primary consideration relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion is the purpose of Crown appeals under s 5D, which ....is 'to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of Courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons'. That is a limiting purpose. It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing Judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion.""

50And at [43]: 
""Other circumstances may combine to produce injustice if a Crown appeal is allowed. They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation. They are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. The guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual.""

51In JW v R Spigelman CJ (at [44]-[141]) undertook an extensive review of the law of ""double jeopardy"" in the interpretation of s. 68A. He concluded (at [141]):
""The following propositions emerge from the above analysis: 
(i) The words ""double jeopardy"" in s 68A refer to the circumstance that an offender is, subject to the identification of error on the part of the sentencing judge, liable to be sentenced twice.(ii) Section 68A removes from consideration on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal the element of distress and anxiety to which all respondents to a Crown appeal are presumed to be subject.(iii) Section 68A prevents the appellate court exercising its discretion not to intervene on the basis of such distress and anxiety.(iv) Section 68A also prevents the appellate court from reducing the sentence which it otherwise believes to be appropriate on the basis of such distress and anxiety.(v) Section 68A prevents the Court from having regard to the frequency of Crown appeals as a sentencing principle applicable to an individual case by taking either step referred to in (iii) or (iv), or otherwise.""


52Allsop P agreed with the Chief Justice at [205] and McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ, while taking a different view on some issues, agreed (at [209]) ""with all the Chief Justice has written about the effect of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001""

53In Green and Queen v The Queen French CJ, Crennan and Kieffel JJ said (at [26]):
""It is not necessary for this Court to review the correctness of the construction of s 68A in JW. On any view of its operation it does not extinguish the residual discretion"" 

54The respondent adduced evidence on the appeal which is relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. This evidence is also relevant in the event that the Court allows the appeal and comes to re-sentence. 

55The evidence comes in the form of four affidavits. Two of those affidavits are from the respondent's solicitor. They annex a number of documents from the Department of Corrective Services, which show that the applicant has made an application to be included in various sex offenders programmes whilst in gaol but that at this stage he has not been accepted into those programmes. That documentation indicates that entry into these programmes is based around release dates. The earlier the release date the more likely an applicant will be accepted into the programme. The material annexed to the solicitor's affidavit also shows that there are treatment programmes available in the community upon the respondent's release. 

56An affidavit of the respondent's mother indicates that in January 2014 the respondent disclosed to her that he had been subject to sexual assault by his brother. This allegedly occurred when he was around 10 years of age. The respondent had not previously disclosed this alleged sexual interference. It formed no part of the assessment made by Dr Seidler in her report tendered before the sentencing judge. When interviewed by Dr Seidler he specifically denied being the victim of sexual offending. This formed part of the reason that the psychologist thought that he was only a moderate risk of re-offending. It is difficult to know what to make of this allegation now and there is no evidence connecting that sexual assault to the respondent's behaviour in the present case. The respondent's mother also notes that her son is ""worried and frightened that his sentence will be increased"". 

57The respondent himself swore an affidavit which confirms that he has been under ""a great deal of stress and anxiety that his sentence may be increased by the court"" since receiving notice that the Crown had appealed against the sentence. 

58The material relied on by the respondent also includes a lengthy psychological report prepared by Ms Laura Durkin dated 15 May 2014. It provides some detail of the alleged sexual assaults in which the respondent was the victim. It also notes that the perpetrator of that assault (the respondent's brother) threatened to kill him if he disclosed what happened. The psychologist is of the opinion that the respondent has symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder as a consequence of that sexual abuse. As I have said, in view of the inconsistent histories provided to the psychologists, it is difficult to know what to make of this allegation. 

59Ms Durkin speaks of the respondent's depression and the difficulties that he has had coping with his time in gaol. It also refers to ""the stress of an appeal that may result in a longer period of incarceration"" and notes that the appeal;
""appears to be exacerbating the aforementioned symptoms, placing additional pressure on [the respondent] and further compromising his functioning"".

60While much of this material is of the kind that might properly play a part in determining whether to exercise the residual discretion, I am unable to conclude that it is sufficient to justify the Court declining to intervene. However the material is relevant to the re-sentencing exercise that must follow intervention.

61For the reasons mentioned earlier I am not persuaded that Judge Berman's approach to the pleas of guilty, the partial accumulation or the proportion between the head sentence and non-parole period was erroneous. I propose (nominally) to adopt a roughly equivalent approach in re-sentencing the respondent. 

62Judge Berman SC did not impose an ""aggregate sentence"" pursuant to s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act). However, I intend to do so. An example of a principled approach to the imposition of aggregate sentences can be seen in the judgment of Fullerton J in SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94: see also R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 per RA Hulme J at [56]-[60] and Brown v R [2012] NSWCCA 199 per Grove AJ at [17], [51]


63I have considered the purposes of sentencing in s. 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and relevant aggravating and mitigating features both at common law and under s. 21A. I have taken into account the maximum penalty of 16 years applicable to each offence and the fact that the nature of the sexual intercourse (unprotected penile vaginal penetration with ejaculation) is generally considered to be of the most serious kind. I have given full weight to the deprivation and hardship of the respondent's background, his youth and lack of previous convictions. I have taken into account that the respondent is being re-sentenced upon a successful prosecution appeal in the manner discussed in the cases to which I have made reference. 

64Count (2) is particularly serious as a result of the tender age of the victim. Count (4) is equally serious because it resulted in the victim becoming pregnant. In my opinion count (6) is the most serious because it occurred when the child was pregnant and the applicant knew or suspected that she was pregnant. 

65For the purpose of s 53A(2) I record that I am imposing an aggregate sentence and that the sentences that would have been imposed for individual offences are:
Count (2) - Two years and nine months. 
Count (4) - Two years and nine months. 
Count (6) - Four years. 

66The aggregate sentence that I propose is one of 5½ years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months. 

67I have made a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This finding is based around the respondent's need for an extended period of supervision and support upon his release and on the partial accumulation inherent in the aggregate sentence which I propose. I have allowed for a discount for the plea of guilty of approximately 20% for the same reasons as Judge Berman SC. While the plea was entered late, it was the culmination of ongoing discussions, which included an offer to plead guilty (to only one offence) in the Local Court. 

68As I said (at [7]), the sentence imposed by Judge Berman SC would have resulted in the respondent's automatic release at the expiration of the non-parole period. That will no longer be the case. Because the sentence is now greater than three years, the question of the respondent's release will be a matter for the Parole Authority: see ss 134-138 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act. It is a matter of concern that the respondent may be incarcerated beyond the period of non-parole that I have proposed. This would be particularly troubling if the gaol authorities are unable to provide him with the kind of rehabilitation programmes considered to be important before making orders releasing an offender on parole. Much of the evidence adduced by the respondent on this appeal concerned his attempts to participate in sex offender programmes in gaol and his request to know whether or not he was required to complete such programmes before he would be released. 

69To this point he has not been accepted into the programmes due to the limited places available. Ultimately these are matters for the Executive and for the Parole Authority and not for this Court. Sentencing courts cannot generally consider such matters when deciding the appropriate length of a sentence. However, I make these observations so that they might be taken into account by those considering the question of the respondent's release on parole at the expiration of his non-parole period. I express the hope that he will be released at the expiration of the non-parole period or very shortly thereafter and that there will be no delay in his release resulting from his inability to complete programmes in the course of his sentence. Obviously those comments are based around an assumption that the respondent continues to make progress while in custody. 

70The orders I propose are as follows; 
(1)The appeal is allowed.

(2)The sentences imposed by Judge Berman SC are quashed.

(3)In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 5 ½ years comprising a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing 25 November 2013 and expiring on 24 August 2016 with a balance of term of two years and nine months to expire on 24 May 2019.

(4)The earliest date upon which the respondent will be eligible for parole is 24 August 2016.

		25 June 2014",2014-06-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764178,Webber v R [2014] NSWCCA 111,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Black DCJ on 13 April 2012 after adhering to a plea of guilty entered in the Local Court on 5 July 2011 to importing a commercial quantity of cocaine, contrary to s 307.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).  That offence attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
3The gross weight of the cocaine was 3280.7 grams with a calculated pure weight of 2219.3 grams.  Schedule 4 of the Criminal Code Regulations 2002 (Cth) defines a commercial quantity of cocaine as 2 kilograms.
4On the same date the applicant adhered to pleas of guilty to supplying one gram of cannabis contrary to s 23(1)(b) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and possessing 73.3 grams of cannabis and 1.6 grams of cocaine contrary to s 10 of that Act.  These offences were the subject of a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).  The sentences imposed for those offences are not the subject of this application.  
5On 3 January 2010 federal agencies intercepted a consignment from Costa Rica declared as ""New Engine 2009 Golf buggy 125cc"" which, upon deconstruction, contained a motorcycle engine in which the cocaine was secreted.  An inert substance was substituted for the cocaine and the parcel reconstituted to resemble its original condition.  The applicant was the nominated consignee with his mobile telephone number noted as the means of contacting him.  A golf course in Mullumbimby, New South Wales was the nominated address for the consignment.  The applicant worked at the golf course as a golf instructor. 
6A controlled delivery of the package was organised through Australia Post.  On 11 January 2010 an Australian Federal Police (AFP) officer acting as a postal employee telephoned the applicant to advise him that the consignment had arrived.  Between 12 and 14 January 2010 arrangements were made with the applicant for the parcel to be collected from Sydney.  The applicant's conversations with police were lawfully intercepted.  This material, summarised in the agreed statement of facts, was the primary material upon which the sentencing judge relied in assessing the applicant's role in the importation. 
7The offences of supply and possession of cannabis and cocaine, the subject of the s 166 certificate, were charged consequent upon police executing a search warrant at the applicant's home on 15 January 2010 at the culmination of the controlled operation into the importation of the cocaine.  In addition to the cannabis and the small quantity of cocaine located at that time, the following items were seized:$93,400 in $50 and $100 notes;electronic scales; anda 2010 diary containing notes of the telephone calls between the applicant and the AFP officer purporting to be an Australia Post employee regarding the collection of the consignment.
8Black DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows:
For the offence of importing a commercial quantity of cocaine contrary to s 307.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995, a term of imprisonment of 11 years to commence from 13 April 2012 with a non-parole period of 7 years. 
For the offence of supplying cannabis contrary to s 23(1)(b) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, a fixed term of 15 months imprisonment. 
For the offence of possessing cannabis contrary to s 10 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, a fixed term of 15 months imprisonment. 
For the offence of possessing cocaine contrary to s 10 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment. 
The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. 
The grounds of appeal
9The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the importation count on two grounds:
Ground 1: His Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant's subjective case. 
Ground 2: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
Proceedings and remarks on sentence 
10No witnesses were called on sentence.  A statement of facts was tendered by consent.  A pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service dated 29 August 2011 was also tendered.  The applicant did not give evidence.  He relied upon a number of testimonials. 
11The prosecution also tendered a statement from the Australian Federal Police assessing the assistance the applicant claimed to have provided in the course of successive interviews on 15 January 2010 and 1 June 2011, and in a statement prepared by his lawyers prior to entering pleas of guilty in the Local Court on 5 July 2011.  The assistance was rated by police as ""low"", in part as a consequence of the applicant's differing and contradictory versions of the events surrounding the importation.  This was consistent with what police regarded as the applicant's attempt to minimise his involvement.  In the circumstances his Honour afforded the offer of assistance no weight.  That finding is not challenged.
12The applicant relied upon a number of testimonials to ground the submission, inter alia, that he was a person of good character and that his offending was for that reason out of character. 
Summary of facts 
13The facts upon which his Honour relied for the purposes of sentence can be stated succinctly. 
14After the interception of the package containing the cocaine on 3 January 2010, and the initiation of the controlled delivery thereafter, the applicant was contacted by telephone on 7 January by Peter Jones.  Jones said that he ""needed a few tips on his putting"" to which the applicant responded that he was ""waiting on a few deliveries for the pro shop"".  It was conceded on sentence that the reference to golf and golfing vernacular in this conversation and in later conversations with Jones was a code utilised by them to disguise the fact that their telephone contact concerned the consignment of the cocaine.  In that call the applicant supplied Jones with his home address and home phone number.  They arranged to meet the following day.  Their meeting was the subject of police surveillance but what was discussed was not.  This is of some significance to one of the submissions advanced by the applicant in support of the second ground of appeal to the effect that the applicant was subordinate to Jones and answerable to his directions and the sentence failed to reflect that fact.  
15On 11 January 2010 an AFP officer purporting to be an Australia Post employee contacted the applicant and informed him that he was nominated as the consignee of a consignment from Costa Rica which was declared as containing a golf buggy but because it was leaking oil it could not be delivered.  The applicant was asked to arrange for the package to be collected from an Australia Post office in Sydney.  He stated that:He had three buggies that someone was currently fixing up;He had to pay for the engine and the person who was fixing the buggies would put it together;He had a previous engine that was leaking oil and that was why he had to get another one;He would ring this person who would know more about how it could be couriered; andHe would call back later that day or the following day.
16In the course of a phone call the following day the applicant asked for the package to be stored until he could arrange for it to be collected.  
17Twenty minutes later the applicant called his de facto partner and reported the following:He had sorted out that ""thing with the oil and motor"", the person was going to put it in long term storage for him;There was no way he was going to send it back to the original sender so he would need to get it in storage and then go down to Sydney and pick it up;He would not go down to Sydney himself but pay for someone to drive it up;When his partner suggested ""Woodsy"", he said that was a good idea; andHis partner should ""stay cool"" and relaxed and he would ""go hard"" and ""sweat"" for both of them.
18Between 11 and 14 January 2010 the applicant had numerous conversations with the AFP officer and Jones in which he coordinated arrangements for Jones to travel to Sydney to collect the package from the Silverwater Post Office. 
19On 15 January 2010, after the execution of the search warrant at the applicant's premises, the applicant participated in an electronically recorded interview in which he denied knowledge of the contents of the package that had to be collected from Sydney and the cocaine found at his property.  He said the cannabis was given to him by someone in discharge of a debt. 
20On Monday 18 January 2010 Jones attended Silverwater Post Office and asked to pick up a package addressed to the applicant.  AFP officers attended and spoke with Jones who asserted that he had been asked by the applicant to collect the package and that he did not know what was in it.  There was no further information in the statement of facts or otherwise tendered on sentence by either the Crown or the applicant as to whether Jones was charged with any offence arising out of his involvement with the importation. 
21The applicant participated in a second record of interview with police on 1 June 2011 after he was served with Court Attendance Notices in August 2010 in respect of all charges to which he ultimately entered pleas of guilty.  In that interview he made various admissions concerning his knowledge of the package but continued to assert that Jones organised the importation using his (the applicant's) name and other personal details as the consignee, and that his only involvement was to accept delivery as a favour to Jones.  In the pre-sentence report dated 1 August 2011 and tendered on sentence the applicant claimed that he was ""set up"" by a long term associate and had become ""unwittingly involved"" in the offence. 
22The assertion that he was set up by Jones was abandoned, at least implicitly, by the plea of guilty to the importation charge.  In his sentencing reasons his Honour found that there was no evidence to suggest any motive for the applicant's involvement other than a financial motive, although the extent to which he stood to gain could not be quantified.  Although he was satisfied that there was no evidence that the applicant was ""unwittingly involved"" in the importation, his Honour was not satisfied that the applicant was the only person who stood to gain from the importation of the cocaine and there was no evidence upon which he could determine the extent of Jones' criminal involvement, if any. 
23With regards to the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour accepted the Crown's submission that the offender performed a significant and essential role in the importation, quoting the following passage of the Crown's submissions as a measured and accurate summary of the applicant's role:
""...the offender engaged in the following conduct: he allowed his name, his contact details and his reputation as a professional golfer to be used in accepting delivery on the consignment concealing cocaine.  He was the point of contact for Australia Post.  He requested Australia Post that the consignment be kept in long term storage until he could arrange collection.  He discussed with his de facto partner, who is then named, the possibility of paying somebody to drive down to Sydney to collect the package and drive it up to Ballina.  He communicated with Australia Post on a number of occasions in order to arrange a day and time for collection of the consignment and he communicated in code and met with a named person to arrange for that person to collect the consignment from Silverwater Post Office."" 
24A 25 per cent discount was allowed for the applicant's plea of guilty.  His Honour found that the applicant was entitled to a further (unquantified) discount on account of the considerable delay.  It was not submitted that the sentence was excessive because of any failure to allow for delay in the ultimate disposition of the matter. 
The applicant's subjective circumstances 
25The applicant was 37 years old at the time of the offence.  His Honour was satisfied that he had no significant criminal record.  He also accepted that prior to his offending the applicant was an admired and respected professional golfer.
26His Honour accepted that the applicant had expressed remorse (although, for my part, I cannot find where in the materials tendered on sentence remorse was expressed).  His Honour went on to observe, somewhat curiously, that there was an absence of any specific material, aside from his plea, in support of that assertion and since the applicant had not given sworn evidence, his Honour was wary of affording remorse any weight for sentencing purposes. 
Ground One: His Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant's subjective case 
27Counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge did not give sufficient weight to the applicant's subjective circumstances in mitigation of sentence in two respects: firstly, by understating the impact of his offending on his personal and professional life and its impact on his mental health; and, secondly, by failing to give sufficient weight to his prospects of rehabilitation. 
28His Honour made express reference to the extra-curial impact of the applicant's offending in his sentencing remarks as follows:
""... it is not surprising to see reference in the pre-sentence report that many people have chosen to isolate the offender as a result of his conduct and that is the sort of result that one can expect from being involved in offences of this kind.""
29The applicant complains that by failing to refer expressly to the following passages of the pre-sentence report, the extent of the extra-curial impact of the applicant's offending conduct was not afforded the weight that it deserved:
""Health/Mental Health Issues
Due to the nature of the offence and how it has been perceived in his local community Mr Webber is suffering from situational depression and is currently medicated.  Mr Webber reports that prior to the offence there were no mental health issues. 
...
Summary And Community Based Sentencing Options 
...
The impact [of] Mr Webber's arrest resulting in local media reports has taken a significant toll on him emotionally and professionally.  He has now been reduced to working casually, has been outcast from the local golfing fraternity and is currently taking medication to treat depression.""
30As his Honour observed, it was hardly surprising that consequent upon the applicant's arrest and charge for serious drug offending, he would be likely (as a professional sportsman) to experience isolation from former sporting colleagues and his associated social and professional milieu.  In any event, as the testimonials relied upon by the applicant demonstrate, and as his Honour noted, the applicant enjoys continuing support from friends and family.
31It was not submitted that the applicant's loss of social and professional standing alone should have justified any amelioration of sentence.  What was submitted was that his Honour understated the significance of the evidence because he made no reference to its secondary impact on the applicant's mental health as a person of otherwise good character.  
32The applicant would have faced difficulty satisfying me that because his Honour did not refer to the particular passages in the pre-sentence report he should be taken to have ignored them or failed to take them into account.  The applicant would also have failed to satisfy me that he was a person of ""extremely good character"" as asserted in his written submissions, although not pressed on appeal.  Further, there was no evidence tendered on sentence to either confirm or elaborate upon what the applicant reported to the Probation and Parole officer as the effects on his mental health consequent upon the exposure of his criminal offending within his local community.  In addition, as noted above, the applicant did not give evidence.  In these circumstances the applicant's self-report that he was taking antidepressant medication as a result of his arrest and the consequent media attention would properly have attracted little weight for sentencing purposes (see Radi v R [2013] NSWCCA 278 at [25]).  The applicant's counsel in the sentencing proceeding did not submit otherwise.  In fact, as the Crown emphasised in written submissions, in oral submissions on sentence the applicant's counsel did not refer to the mental health issues reported by the applicant at all, much less seek to persuade his Honour that they should be taken into account in mitigation in accordance with the settled principles most recently restated in Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61.  
33In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [75]-[83], in the context of considering a ground of appeal constituted by the failure of a sentencing judge to mention that the matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, Johnson J restated the fundamental proposition that this Court is a court of error such that the jurisdiction of the Court under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is only invoked where there is an error of principle or some other fact or law.  It was in that context that his Honour said at [80] that there is a practical expectation that an offender's legal representative will advance submissions at first instance referable to the particular factors which are relied upon in mitigation: Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [11]; Dyer v R [2011] NSWCCA 185 at [49].
34Although the sentencing judge made no express finding as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, when considering the issue of rehabilitation generally he made the following observations:
""As far as rehabilitation is concerned, I note that over many years he says that he has indulged in a small personal way in drugs, so I cannot be sure that that will not happen again, I would like to think that it will not...""
35The applicant's history of drug use was before his Honour by way of the applicant's admission to the author of the pre-sentence report that he had a long history of infrequent social use of cannabis.  The applicant's criminal history was also tendered.  It included a conviction in 1999 for self-administer/attempt self-administer prohibited drug, and possess prohibited drug, for both of which he received a fine.  
36Again, complaint is made that his Honour failed to refer to a passage of the pre-sentence report which addressed the applicant's risk of reoffending in the following terms:
""The offender has been assessed as unlikely to require, or benefit from, supervision by this Service for the following reasons:  Mr Webber has a limited criminal history, is deemed low risk of further offending and has no significant issues requiring ongoing support..."" 
37It was submitted that his Honour should also have found that because the applicant's prior offences were relatively minor, the likelihood of his reoffending was low, thereby attracting a positive finding as to his prospects of rehabilitation in mitigation of sentence in contrast to the guarded terms in which his Honour dealt with the issue.  
38An assessment of an offender's prospects of rehabilitation is for the sentencing judge.  Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) expressly provides that rehabilitation is one of the matters to be taken into account on sentence together with the other statutory objectives in s 3A.  While a Probation and Parole officer may offer an opinion on the question of rehabilitation in order to inform the Court of the need, where appropriate, for supervision on parole, a sentencing judge is not bound by any view the officer might express on the prospects of rehabilitation for sentencing purposes.  Further, as the Crown submitted, the value of the Probation and Parole officer's assessment of the applicant's risk of reoffending is undermined in this case by the applicant's claim to her that his role in the importation was because he was ""set up"", an assertion which, as I have already noted, his Honour expressly rejected.   
39In the result I am not persuaded that the way in which his Honour addressed the applicant's subjective circumstances admits of error.  I would reject the first ground of appeal.  
Ground Two: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive 
40In written submissions counsel for the applicant contended that his Honour's findings as to the role the applicant performed in the importation (set out at paragraph [23] above) allowed for the related finding (not made by the judge) that the applicant provided his name and contact details to be used as consignee at Jones' request as the person who organised the importation.  It was then submitted that because the applicant had agreed to be the nominated consignee it necessarily fell to him to deal with the person he believed to be an Australia Post employee to arrange for the collection of the package.  Analysed in this way, counsel submitted that in accepting the Crown's submission that the applicant's role was ""significant"" and ""essential"" his Honour inflated what the applicant actually did in facilitating the importation and that a harsher penalty than was justified was imposed as a consequence.  In his written submissions counsel described the applicant's role in the importation as minor, and which in oral argument he likened to that of a bare courier, subordinate to others who controlled the importation. 
41Counsel then sought to position the applicant within the fourth category of offender indentified by McClellan CJ at CL at [215] in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 where his Honour observed of the various cases to which he made reference that head sentences ranged from 6.25 years to 8 years with non-parole periods between 3 and 4.5 years.  
42Counsel acknowledged that in R v Tran; R v Tran and R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 136 I restated the position of this Court in a line of cases after De La Rosa that his Honour's categorisation of offenders at [207]-[224] is of limited application where a ground of either manifest excess or inadequacy of sentence is argued.  However, to cite the sentence range in the fourth category of offenders identified by McClellan CJ at CL as suggesting some prime facie guide to an appropriate sentencing range is to effectively ignore that line of authority.   
43Although the sentencing judge did not make any reference in his remarks on sentence to comparable cases, the Crown annexed to his written submissions what was described as ""a comparative sentencing schedule of four cases"", which included Ng v R (Cth) [2010] NSWCCA 232.  During the course of the sentence proceedings his Honour observed that the sentence imposed on that offender (and not disturbed on appeal) was ""not far off"", which I take his Honour to mean was a sentencing outcome difficult to distinguish from the sentence he was minded to impose on the applicant.  Ng was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 3 months for his role in importing a commercial quantity of heroin in the net weight of 2.445kg contrary to s 307.1 of the Criminal Code Act.  The applicant's counsel sought to persuade his Honour that the case of R v Todoroski (District Court (NSW), Sorby DCJ, 14 August 2009, unrep) (another case on the Crown's schedule) was a more suitable comparator.  In that case the offender was sentenced to 6 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months following his plea of guilty to an offence of attempt to possess a marketable quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug (heroin) contrary to ss 11.1(1) and 307.6(1) of the Criminal Code Act.  
44On the appeal it was submitted that his Honour's undoubted reliance upon Ng to the exclusion of the other cases was misplaced.  Not only were the steps undertaken by Ng said by counsel to be more egregious because of Ng's physical transportation of the drugs into Australia, but his subjective circumstances were far less favourable than the applicant's by reason of his criminal record and his proven connection with a drug milieu in Singapore.  It was also submitted that the Crown's commentary in the schedule of cases wrongly attributed to this Court a view that the sentence imposed at first instance on Ng was lenient when that was the express view of RS Hulme J only, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Davies J agreed) not being of that opinion.  
45While that is plainly correct, it does little to advance the applicant's case on this application when the sentencing judge made no reference to the views of RS Hulme J in Ng (or to any of the cases relied upon by the Crown) as somehow justifying the sentence he imposed.  There are both similarities and differences between Ng and this case, both involving the importation of a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug.  The question is whether, on a fair comparison of the roles that each of the offenders performed in the importation in which they were complicit, the role of this applicant is relevantly different. 
46Consistent with the statement of principle in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 recently restated in Barbaro v R [2014] HCA 2, the question for this Court is whether, having regard to who the applicant is and what he has been shown to have done in facilitating the importation of a commercial quantity of cocaine, and after due consideration is given to cases appropriately comparable, it is clear that an excessive sentence has been imposed such as to manifest error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  As is frequently repeated in this Court, it is not to the point that the sentence under challenge might be described as severe, whether by reference to other cases or sentencing statistics, or whether this Court would have imposed the same or some other sentence.  The question is whether the sentence under challenge exceeds the bounds of a proper sentencing discretion. 
47In oral submissions counsel accepted that the outcome of the appeal would depend upon whether the Court was persuaded that the applicant's role, referable to the agreed statement of facts, had been wrongly inflated by the sentencing judge.  Counsel conceded that if the applicant's role was not at what he described as ""the lower end"" of criminality for importations of a commercial quantity of border-controlled drug - which I take him to mean a role not dissimilar to that of a courier in the sense that he was subordinate to Jones as the person who organised the importation and the person who stood to profit from it - then, although the sentence was severe, it was nonetheless within range.  For my part, to ascribe to the applicant a role at the lower end is to ignore what resonates from a fair reading of the agreed facts as a whole.  Whatever might have been Jones' role in the importation, the overwhelming inference from the statement of facts is that this applicant was well versed with the configuration of the consignment to be able to converse with those he believed would be able to arrange for delivery or collection of it and to respond in the moment to the strategy the police were employing as part of the controlled delivery and make adjustments to the arrangements for its collection.  His conversation with his partner is further support for that view.  In the result, I am not persuaded that the applicant played a minor role subordinate to Jones.  The evidence at least well supports a degree of knowledge and involvement commensurate with that of a joint venture with Jones.  
48Analysed in that way, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed on the applicant is manifestly excessive in the sense that it is unreasonable or plainly unjust.
49The orders I propose are:1.  Leave to appeal is granted.2.  The appeal is dismissed.
50ADAMSON J:  I agree with Fullerton J.

2764181,Rajendran v R [2014] NSWCCA 113,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA: I agree with Bellew J.

2BELLEW J: On 18 January 2010 Paul Diwakar Rajendran (""the appellant"") pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging that on 10 March 2009, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, he had sexual intercourse with AB without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting. That is an offence contrary to s. 61I(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment.

3On 29 January 2010 the appellant was found guilty by a jury. On 15 April 2010 he was sentenced by her Honour Judge Payne to imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months, commencing on 11 October 2009 and expiring on 10 April 2017, with a non-parole period of 5 years, expiring on 10 October 2014. A subsequent appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against conviction was dismissed. Leave was granted to the appellant to appeal against sentence, and that appeal was also dismissed (see Rajendran v R [2010] NSWCCA 322).

4Following his conviction, the appellant made an application pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Review Act"") and asserted that a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance had arisen which warranted a referral of the matter to this Court. In short, the appellant asserted that her Honour had erred by adopting a two-stage process to sentencing, contrary to the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.

5On 18 March 2014, Johnson J granted the appellant's application and referred the matter to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (see Application by Paul Rajendran pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 270).

THE FACTS
6The following summary is taken from her Honour's remarks on sentence.

7In or about early March 2009 the appellant, using the pseudonym ""James Carter"", began to communicate with AB via ""My Space"". They subsequently communicated with each other by email. AB was apparently wishing to enter the modelling industry and the appellant falsely portrayed himself as an agent working for the ""La Perla"" lingerie company, and thus someone who could assist AB with her chosen career. 

8In the course of their correspondence the appellant and AB discussed meeting in the city. AB then made arrangements to meet the appellant for what she thought was an interview for prospective work as a model. The appellant, in a continuation of his deception of AB, asked her to send him a resume for his records. 

9On the evening of 10 March 2009 AB went into the city and met the appellant. At his instigation, they went to a bar where AB consumed champagne and became well affected by alcohol. 

10The appellant then invited AB to go with him to discuss how she would undertake modelling assignments for La Perla. That was obviously not the case. They arrived at premises which were in fact the appellant's place of employment, to which he had 24 hour access

11After they went inside the premises the appellant left the room twice, once to get a glass of water and once to turn off a light switch. When he came back on the second occasion he lent over and tried to kiss AB. AB's response was to say to the appellant: 

""I really didn't come here for this"".

12 AB then told the jury: 

""And I got quite frightened because I knew that I wasn't meant to even be there. And then he apologised and told me to sit back down...the next thing I remember he tried to, he tried to change the subject and put the pictures back on the table again for me to look at. But then I can't remember anything except that the next thing I remember I was sitting on the desk and he was leaning over the top of me, trying to kiss me...That is only a quick flash that I can remember so I don't really remember how I responded...I was leaning back and my feet were off the ground and he was leaning over the top of me"".

13AB described in her evidence how the appellant leant across her chest towards her face, and that the next thing she remembered was laying on the ground crying. She described feeling ""really really scared and frightened"" as she lay on the floor, and thinking that she did not wish to be there. She described that at that point she could ""hardly breathe"".

14As she lay on the floor crying, she had no clothes on, with the exception of her skirt which was around her waist. She described the appellant standing above her, naked from the waist down, placing a condom on his penis. 

15The appellant's crying increased to the point where she described it as ""fairly loud"". She said that she had ""tears all over her face"". She explained that she ""sort of knew what was going to happen...and (she) couldn't really do anything because (she) was so out of it at the time"". She then said:

""He leant down and started having sex with me. He put his body directly on top of mine and his arms either side of my body...I was hysterical, loudly crying, it hurt...I couldn't breathe properly because I was so upset"".

16AB said that the appellant asked her more than once during intercourse why she was crying, and told her to stop. She said that by the time that she could remember that intercourse had ceased the appellant was already dressed, although she remained on the ground crying. She recalled rolling over, seeing her clothes and trying to put them back on. She described herself at that point as ""still crying ... really hysterical ... frightened (and) ... short of breath"". She said: 

""...he did say to me then that that was between me and him and not to tell anybody about it, that he would make me into a big model if I didn't tell anybody"".

A PRELIMINARY ISSUE
17I have already noted that this matter came before this Court pursuant to an order of Johnson J, which was made consequent the appellant's application under the Review Act. It is apparent from the reasons of Johnson J (at [17] - [18]) that his Honour made that order solely on the basis that it was open to conclude that the sentencing judge had, contrary to the decision in Muldrock, engaged in a two-stage approach to sentencing the appellant. That issue forms the basis of Ground 1 of the present appeal. 

18However, the appellant sought to rely upon three additional grounds in which he asserted other errors on the part of the sentencing judge. Those errors formed no part of his application under the Review Act. As a consequence, they were not matters considered by Johnson J and they formed no part of the basis upon which his Honour ordered the referral of the matter to this Court. 

19In written submissions the Crown argued that in order to rely upon Grounds 2, 3 and 4 the appellant required both an extension of time and the leave of the Court. In opposing both, the Crown relied upon previous submissions made to this Court in R v Luizos in which the same issue arose. That appeal was heard by a differently constituted bench of this Court, and judgment is presently reserved.

20In response to the Crown's position, and in the course of careful and comprehensive oral submissions, counsel for the appellant submitted that there was no requirement for either a grant of leave or an order extending time in respect of Grounds 2, 3 and 4. In summary, counsel for the appellant submitted that the reference in s. 79(2) of the Review Act to ""the whole case"", as well as the use of the word ""appealed"" in s. 86 of the same Act, supported the conclusion that a referral of a matter to this Court following an application under s. 79 of the Review Act encompassed a referral of the entirety of the case and encompassed all relevant issues. In further support of that submission, counsel referred the Court to a number of authorities including Mickelberg v R [1989] HCA 35; (1989) 167 CLR 259; Mallard v R [2005] HCA 68; (2005) 224 CLR 125; JJT v R [2006] NSWCCA 83; and Kearns v R [2011] NSWCCA 103; (2011) 213 A Crim R 150.

21In the alternative, counsel for the appellant submitted that if the Court found that Ground 1 was made out, it would be open to consider the matters raised in Grounds 2, 3 and 4 in the course of determining, in accordance with s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, whether some other sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed.

22For the reasons more fully set out below, I have concluded that the error asserted in Ground 1 is made out. That being so, the provisions of s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 are enlivened. In those circumstances it is not necessary for this Court, in order to determine the appeal, to reach a conclusion as to whether the appellant requires an extension of time, or leave of the Court, to rely upon Grounds 2, 3 and 4. The matters raised in those grounds will be considered in the context of the exercise of the Court's function under s. 6(3).

Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in adopting a two-stage approach to the sentencing task and gave the standard non-parole period determinative significance

The findings of the sentencing judge
23In the course of the sentence proceedings, her Honour said the following in an exchange with counsel (commencing at T13 L22): 

""But what are the matters that go towards not imposing the standard non-parole period? The standard non-parole period is seven years against the maximum penalty of fourteen. You've got to give me specifically the reasons why you would not - matters aggravating, well, you say one of the features is you say it's moderately below but the standard non-parole period, even if you were of that view, and I'm not saying I am, is still a guide post, even if its not within the middle range and its still necessary for the judge to say where it falls and the reason for not imposing the standard non-parole period, mitigating and aggravating.""

24Subsequently, at T21 L39 her Honour asked Counsel then appearing for the Crown:

"".... what, if any, features do you say may call for some moderation of the standard non-parole period?

25Later, when considering some of the authorities to which she had been referred by the Crown her Honour said (at T22 L21):

""But where's the reasons why they didn't impose the standard non-parole period? I don't see them, where are they?""

26Against this background, when imposing sentence her Honour said (at ROS 9):

""In my view the objective seriousness of the offence falls within the middle range but in the band - if you see it as a band, which one must, being the middle range and the lower band of the middle range - towards the top of the lower band of the middle range"".

27Her Honour continued (at ROS 11):

""The Crown said there were no aggravating factors in this case and the defence agreed with that. He has said he is prepared to seek assistance in respect of his offending behaviour.""

Section 54A(2) provides as follows: 

For the purposes of this Division, the standard non-parole period for an offence is the non-parole period set out opposite the offence in the Table to this Division. 

I have already said that this is a table (sic) offence. Section 54B provides

(2) When determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.

(3) The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in s. 21A.

(4) The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account.

Within s. 21A there are the specific factors or features found within that section but in addition s. 21A(1)(c) is ""any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence."" In my view, given the features that I have stated, that is to say his prior good character, he is a person with no prior record, he has worked and because of his age has a reasonable stock of good character, it is those factors which in my view allow some modification in his favour of the standard non-parole period.""

28Her Honour then said (at ROS 12):

""I remind myself that the maximum penalty is fourteen years and the standard non-parole period is seven years. 

Another reason for there being some modification of the standard non-parole period in this case is that I am of the view that there are special circumstances...""

Submissions of the appellant
29It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the sentencing judge had engaged in an impermissible two-stage process of sentencing, firstly by giving primary (or perhaps determinative) significance to the standard non-parole period, and then by making an enquiry as to whether there were matters which justified the imposition of a non-parole period which was longer or shorter than that which was prescribed. This, it was submitted, was contrary to the decision in Muldrock (supra).

30Reference was also made to the earlier judgment of this Court which determined the appellant's earlier appeal, and to the observations of Simpson J (at [70]) which, it was submitted, reflected the adoption of the same approach as that of the sentencing judge.

Submissions of the Crown
31The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had made findings as to the objective gravity of the offence and had then turned to consider the entirety of the appellant's subjective circumstances. It was submitted that when the sentencing remarks were read as a whole, it was clear that the sentencing judge had taken all relevant matters into account and had used the standard non-parole period not in a determinative way, but rather as a guide to the exercise of her sentencing discretion. It was submitted that such an approach was perfectly permissible and did not contravene the principles set out in Muldrock (supra) (as to which see Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 per Johnson J at [43] (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed)).

Determination 
32In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded (at [25]) that it was an error to regard the terms of s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") as requiring a court to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for determining whether an offence was appropriately assessed as being in the middle of the range. The High Court concluded (at [26]) that it was an error to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period, and that the correct approach was to identify all the relevant factors (including any prescribed standard non-parole period) before making a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence.

33Importantly (at [28]) the High Court specifically rejected the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, followed by an inquiry as to whether there are matters justifying the imposition of a non-parole period which is longer or shorter than that which is prescribed. In arriving at these conclusions, the Court held that R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 had been wrongly decided. 

34This Court has observed on a number of occasions that in determining whether or not a Muldrock-type error has been established, it is necessary to review the reasons for sentence as a whole and not confine examination to one particular passage or sentence which is said to reflect error (see for example Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [30], citing Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153 at [2] and Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [43]). What must be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error so as to enliven the court's discretion to intervene. 

35With these matters in mind, I am satisfied that the error for which the appellant contended in Ground 1 has been made out. 

36Although the sentencing judge made reference to the relevant objective and subjective factors, it is evident from what her Honour said in the sentence proceedings, as well as from her remarks on sentence, that her Honour regarded herself as being tied to the standard non-parole period. In my view, it is clear that having assessed where the offending fell in terms of a range of objective seriousness, her Honour embarked upon a determination of whether or not there were features which justified a departure from the standard non-parole period. In doing so, her Honour applied the two-stage process to sentencing which the High Court concluded in Muldrock was erroneous. 

37In these circumstances, error having been found, the matters raised in Grounds 2, 3 and 4 will be considered in determining whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. In this regard it should be emphasised that the appellant has not asserted, and it is not necessary for the appellant to establish, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to sentence the appellant on the basis that he was unreasonably mistaken as to AB's consent.

The relevant legislative provisions
38In order to place the issue raised by this ground in its proper context some brief reference to the relevant legislative provisions is necessary.

39Section 61I(1) of the Crimes Act, under which the appellant was charged is in the following terms:

61I Sexual assault 
Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 14 years. 

40Section 61HA(3) of the same Act is in the following terms:

61HA Consent in relation to sexual assault offences 

Knowledge about consent

......
(3) A person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse if: 

(a) the person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, or 

(b) the person is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, or 

(c) the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse. 
For the purpose of making any such finding, the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case: 

(d) including any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, but 

(e) not including any self-induced intoxication of the person.

41In the context of the present case, the effect of s. 61HA(3) was that in order to prove the element of knowledge the Crown was required to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant:

(i)knew that AB did not consent to the sexual intercourse; or

(ii)was reckless as to whether AB consented; or

(iii)had no reasonable grounds for believing that AB consented.

The sentence proceedings 
42 On the basis of the evidence of AB (set out at [11]-[16] above) the Crown made the following submission to the sentencing judge (at T3 L8 and following): 

""...your Honour's discussion with me was the necessity of leading the different states of mind that the Crown insisted upon, that is whether there was a knowledge of lack of consent or whether there was recklessness or whether the offender did not reasonably believe that she was consenting. In our submission, your Honour, should sentence the offender on the basis that he knew she was not consenting because of what she said to him, ""I didn't come here for this"", because she was crying - - ...visibly. Although, of course, our case was that really she had in a sense surrendered but there's sufficient detail there for the offender to have known she was not consenting"" (emphasis added).

43Her Honour then inquired (commencing at T3 L31) whether, in the Crown's submission, actual knowledge of a lack of consent, as opposed to recklessness in that regard, would render the offending more serious. The Crown responded by submitting that there was no ""blanket"" proposition which rendered one more serious than the other. 

44Subsequently the following exchange took place between the Crown and her Honour (at T4 L49 and following):

CROWN: But its at that point that he is - either has direct knowledge or he is reckless or his belief is unreasonable, whichever way you look at it that she --

HER HONOUR He always planned to take advantage of her didn't 
he?

CROWN: He always did. He always did. ......

45It was conceded that counsel for the appellant on sentence made no submission whatsoever in relation to this issue. 




The findings of the sentencing judge
46The sentencing judge reached the following findings (commencing at ROS 13):

""In relation to this matter being a case in respect of which the more recent provisions concerning consent applied, a number of directions were given in that connection. The jury of course had to be of the view that she did not consent and that there was relevant knowledge of lack of consent. Actual knowledge and recklessness were left to the jury. Also the direction was given concerning reasonable grounds.

In my view it is difficult to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the precise basis of his knowledge of lack of consent. In my view, and consistent the jury's verdict, it is clear she did not consent. To my mind it does not really matter in this case in terms of the seriousness of the offending whether it be actual knowledge or recklessness - or to put it another way, it does not really matter which phrase was (sic) upon which the jury found he had relevant knowledge. What is clear though is that they accepted that he did have relevant knowledge in terms of her lack of consent.""

Submissions of the appellant
47Counsel for the appellant submitted that her Honour had erred in failing to consider the appellant's knowledge in the context of s. 61HA(3)(c). Counsel submitted that it was incumbent upon the sentencing judge to give consideration to that issue, even in the absence of any submission having been made in relation to it by counsel who appeared for the appellant on sentence.

48Counsel took particular issue with her Honour's observation that ""it did not really matter"" whether a finding was reached as to whether the appellant had actual knowledge on the one hand, or was reckless on the other. It was submitted that if a conclusion had been reached that the appellant was unreasonably mistaken about the fact that AB did not consent (as opposed to knowing that she did not consent or being reckless as to that issue) such a conclusion would have had the effect of decreasing the seriousness of the offending and the associated need for the imposition of condign punishment (see Sabapathy v R [2008] NSWCCA 82 at [70]).

49It was further submitted that if it were the case that her Honour was not able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the basis of the appellant's knowledge, the appellant ought to have been sentenced on the most favourable basis, namely that he had no reasonable grounds for believing that AB consented (s. 61AH(3)(c)). 

Submissions of the Crown
50The Crown submitted that the evidence supported a conclusion that the appellant knew that AB was not consenting to sexual intercourse and that any reference to recklessness on the part of the sentencing judge was a generous one. It was submitted that in circumstances where the sole issue before the jury was that of consent, the jury had obviously accepted the account of AB. In this regard the Crown pointed, in particular, to the evidence of AB set out in [11]-[16] above and submitted that it must have been clear to the appellant that AB did not consent. 

Determination
51As set out in [42] above, the Crown specifically submitted that the sentencing judge should find that the appellant knew that AB did not consent. The Crown's subsequent reference to alternative bases upon which knowledge may have been found (at [44] above) was made in the context of an exchange with her Honour as to the issue of planning. Those references did not qualify, or in any way derogate from, the Crown's clearly stated position that her Honour should find that the appellant knew that AB did not consent. 

52The Crown having put that position, counsel then appearing for the appellant did not respond to it. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant in this Court that notwithstanding the absence of any submission in response to that of the Crown, the sentencing judge was nevertheless required to sentence the appellant on the basis of s. 61AH(3)(c) because that was the most favourable basis upon which to do so. In this regard counsel for the appellant relied upon the decision in R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. 

53I am unable to accept that submission. As a general proposition, a party will be bound by counsel's conduct of proceedings at first instance (see generally Zreika (supra) at [79]-[80] per Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing); see also Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 per Johnson J (at [36]) (McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlag J agreeing)). In the present case counsel for the appellant on sentence took no issue with the Crown's stated position. In my view, the matter not having been put in issue, the sentencing judge was not required to consider it. 

54In Poniris v R [2014] NSWCCA 100 this Court recently considered the issue of whether a trial judge was required to consider the exclusion of evidence under s. 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 in circumstances where no reliance was placed upon the provisions of that section by counsel who appeared for the appellant at trial. Macfarlan JA (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) concluded (at [50]) that the trial judge had not erred in not considering the matter. In my view, the reasoning which led the Court to that conclusion is equally applicable in the present circumstances. The parties define the issues in proceedings. In the present case, counsel for the appellant on sentence took no issue with the Crown's position as to what her Honour should find in respect of the appellant's knowledge. 

55The decision of this Court in Isaacs (supra) is not authority for the proposition that there is a general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender on the most favourable factual basis which is available. This Court (Gleeson CJ, Mason P, Hunt CJ at CL, Simpson and Hidden JJ) said (at 378):

""4. ...... findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt.

5. There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of a view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender: R v Harris. However, the practical effect of 4 above, in a given case, may be that because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender. When that occurs, it will be because of the application of the principles referred to in 4 to the facts of the particular case, and not because of some principle requiring sentencing on the basis of leniency: R v Lupoi (1984) 15 A Crim R 183 at 184. 

56It was not put to her Honour that she should entertain any reasonable doubt about the Crown's proposition that the appellant knew that AB did not consent. In these circumstances, contrary to the submission advanced on behalf of the appellant before this Court, the decision in Isaacs did not compel her Honour to sentence the appellant on the basis which was most favourable to him. 

57For these reasons Ground 2 is not made out. 

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred in finding that the mitigating factor of remorse was not present.

The evidence 
58A Pre-sentence report was tendered before the sentencing judge. Under the heading ""Attitude to the offence"" the following was stated:

""The offender agreed with the police facts. He stated that although he feels the sex was consensual he acknowledged that he has caused the victim a great deal of pain and was very sorry for that. He said that he is ashamed of what has happened and is willing to accept punishment and treatment accordingly. He stated that he is keen to address his offending behaviour to minimise his risk of re-offence and was adamant that he wanted to express his sincere regret to the victim"" (emphasis added).

59The appellant's statements led the author of the Pre-sentence report to make the following observation:

""It is concerning that he appears to have failed to recognise that the victim was not a willing participant in what he believed was a casual sexual encounter"".

60The appellant also wrote a letter to the sentencing judge which was tendered on sentence and which stated (inter alia) as follows:

""Your Honour, first and foremost, I would like to apologise to (AB) for the pain and distress I brought to her. I lied about who I was and what I could do in organising the meeting. This is a cross I still carry and apologise from the bottom heart. If I had felt even in the slightest that (AB) was not consenting or was not in a state of mind to make that decision, the events as they happened that evening would not have. Still your Honour I have caused grief to (AB) for which I am deeply sorry"" (emphasis added).

61The letter then continued:

""Your Honour this letter is by no means meant to undo my mistake but only the start of a new journey for me"" (emphasis added).

The findings of the sentencing judge
62Against the above background her Honour said (commencing at ROS 17):

""He wrote a letter to the court which became Exhibit 1. I have taken into account the contents of that. Further, he apologised to the victim in the pre-sentence report and indicated he was sorry for his behaviour. However, as the Crown pointed out, he still has not taken responsibility for his offending behaviour. In his mind he did not commit any offence.""

63Section 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act provides that remorse shown by an offender is a mitigating factor if:

(i)the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions; and

(ii)has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury loss or damage (or both).
64Having referred to those provisions her Honour continued (at ROS 18):

""It could not be said that he has accepted responsibility for his actions. Having said that, I do give some small weight to his statement concerning - in terms of his apology and show of remorse for the offence but that is some very limited, small weight so the mitigating factor of remorse is not present in this case.""

Submissions of the appellant
65The essence of what was put on the appellant's behalf in support of this ground appears at paragraph (42) of the written submissions:

""However, if the appellant was sentenced on the basis that his state of mind was unreasonably mistaken (as submits he should have been, if ground 2 succeeds, and should be if he is re-sentenced by this Court), remorse was present. He accepted responsibility for his mistake. Her Honour's finding that remorse was not present is thus both indicative of the fact that she sentenced the appellant on the basis of the more serious of the contested facts, which she did not find proved beyond reasonable doubt, and that this error likely increased the term of the appellant's sentence, if for no other reason than that he was denied the full benefit of his remorse.""

Submissions of the Crown
66The Crown submitted that there was no error arising from her Honour's findings. It was submitted that those findings were amply supported by the evidence and that statements made by the appellant supported the conclusion that he was not remorseful.

Determination 
67It will be apparent from paragraph [65] above that the appellant's position on this ground was predicated, to some extent, on the basis that Ground 2 would be upheld. For the reasons I have already expressed Ground 2 cannot succeed. However, there are difficulties faced by the appellant in respect of the present Ground which are independent of Ground 2. 

68It is apparent from the contents of the Pre-sentence report that even after the jury's verdict the appellant continued to assert that the intercourse was consensual. Further, in his letter to the sentencing judge the appellant asserted, in effect, that there had been no indication given by AB that she was not consenting. In my view, those assertions are contrary to the evidence of AB, and at odds with acceptance, by the appellant, of responsibility for his actions. They are equally at odds with an acceptance, by the appellant, of the jury's verdict. 

69In my view, her Honour's conclusion that there was no remorse on the part of the appellant was correct. For these reasons, Ground 3 is not made out.

Ground 4 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to find that the appellant was unlikely to re-offend.

The findings of the sentencing judge
70The Pre-sentence report, under the heading ""Treatment Options"" stated the following:

""Mr Rajendran's static actuarial risk of sexually reoffending, as assessed by the Static-99, is low (Static-99 score of 1). However due to the presence of a number of dynamic risk factors existing around the time of the sex offence that may not have been fully addressed to date. Mr Rajendran's overall risk (Static risk and Dynamic risk) of sexual reoffending as (sic) moderate-low.""

71Her Honour was obviously aware of the Pre-sentence report, having expressly referred to it in her sentencing remarks (at ROS 9). She did not refer specifically to the passage set out above but did reach the following finding (at ROS 19):

""...... In my view he has fair to reasonable prospects of rehabilitation...""

Submissions of the appellant
72It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that her Honour did not refer, at any point, to the conclusion expressed in the Pre-sentence report that the appellant was a low to moderate risk of sexual re-offending. It was submitted that this was a mitigating factor which should have been taken into account in the appellant's favour having regard to s. 21A(3)(g) of the Sentencing Act, and that her Honour's failure to do so amounted to a material error. 

Submissions of the Crown
73The Crown submitted that there was no obligation upon the sentencing judge to reach a finding that the appellant was unlikely to re-offend. It was submitted, in effect, that her Honour had addressed this issue when expressing her findings in relation to the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation and that no error had been established. 

Determination 
74In the present case, her Honour gave ex tempore reasons immediately following hearing submissions. This Court has said on a number of occasions that ex tempore reasons given by Judges of the District Court in the conduct of a busy list should not be overly scrutinised (see for example Rose v R [2013] NSWCCA 71 at [41] (per Bellew J, Hoeben CJ at CL and Slattery J agreeing) citing Gommesen v R (2012) 62 MVR 196; [2012] NSWCCA 226 at [37]-[38] and Warner (aka Jeremy Pachenko) v R [2013] NSWCCA 10 at [33]). 

75Her Honour did not expressly refer to the appellant's assessed risk of sexual re-offending which was recorded in the Pre-sentence report. However, the absence of any reference to that matter does not automatically lead to the conclusion that it was not taken into account (see for example Delaney v R [2013] NSWCCA 150 at [85]-[88] per Hoeben CJ at CL, Harrison and Beech-Jones JJ agreeing). 

76Her Honour was obviously aware of the Pre-sentence report and its contents. She made a specific finding as to the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation, an issue to which the risk of further offending was obviously relevant. It was clear from her overall approach that she had regard to the relevant principles.

77For these reasons, Ground 4 is not made out. 

Is some other sentence warranted in law?
78Notwithstanding my determination of Grounds 2, 3 and 4 it remains necessary to consider whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. In this regard, and aside from reliance upon the matters agitated in support of Grounds 2, 3 and 4, counsel for the appellant relied upon: 

(i)sentencing statistics;
(ii)sentences imposed in other cases of similar offending which were said to provide ""useful guidance"" to the determination of an appropriate sentence; and
(iii)the appellant's affidavit evidence.

79As to the first of those matters, counsel for the appellant relied upon the fact that the relevant statistics demonstrated that of all relevant offenders, the sentence imposed upon the appellant was the longest by 1.5 years. 

80As to reliance upon sentences imposed in other cases it was expressly conceded on behalf of the appellant that none of the cases to which this Court was referred were ""precisely analogous"". However with that qualification, this Court was referred to four particular cases for comparative purposes, namely R v JRB [2006] NSWCCA 371; Salmond v R [2010] NSWCCA 141; Sabapathy v R [2008] NSWCCA 82; and McCartney v R [2009] NSWCCA 244.

81It was further submitted that the affidavit evidence established (inter alia) that the appellant:

(i)was remorseful;
(ii)had completed a sexual offender's course;
(iii)had attempted to enrol in other courses but (through no fault of his own) had not been successful in doing so; and
(iv)had been denied a C3 classification which had rendered his conditions of custody more onerous.

Submissions of the Crown
82The Crown submitted that in light of the wide range of conduct embraced by the definition of ""sexual intercourse"" for the purposes of s. 61I, it was necessary to adopt a cautious approach when considering sentencing statistics (see R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20; (2011) 194 A Crim R 1). 

83The Crown analysed some of the cases relied upon by the appellant for comparative purposes and submitted that each was distinguishable from the case of the appellant in various material respects. The Crown submitted that consistency in sentencing necessarily involves consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, as opposed to numerical equivalence (see Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2 at [40]). 

84As to the affidavit evidence, the Crown submitted that it did not place the appellant in any different position to that in which he found himself when originally sentenced. 

85Finally, the Crown submitted that the sentence imposed by her Honour was entirely warranted on the facts. 

Consideration and conclusion
86The necessity to take a generally cautious approach to the use of sentencing statistics has been emphasised by this Court on a number of occasions (see for example Jolly v R [2013] NSWCCA 76 at [53], citing R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 153). This is because statistics, of themselves, may be of limited use.

87Moreover, the fact that a particular sentence, by reference to statistics, is established as being the longest ever imposed for particular offending is, by itself, of limited assistance in determining whether some other sentence is warranted. In Jolly (supra) with the concurrence of Hoeben CJ at CL and Slattery J, I made the following observations (at [75]):

""As to ground 5, the first observation to be made is that simply because a particular sentence is the highest which has ever been imposed for a particular offence does not, without more, establish manifest excess. Such a bald proposition necessarily fails to take into account the circumstances of the particular offending, and the circumstances of the offender, which resulted in the particular sentence being imposed. There is also considerable merit in the Crown's submission that, as a matter of common sense, there will always be a sentence which constitutes the longest sentence imposed for a particular type of offending.""

88Those observations were made in the context of determining a ground of appeal which asserted that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. As I have noted, the appellant makes no such complaint in the present case and is not required, for the purposes of s. 6(3), to prove manifest excess. However, such observations remain apposite in light of the submission made on the appellant's behalf.

89Sentences imposed in other cases of similar offending may be used as a yardstick to determine whether some other sentence ought to have been imposed. Again however, it is necessary to approach any such exercise with caution. In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Blackman; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Jomaa [2014] NSWCCA 90 I made reference (with the concurrence of Beazley P and R A Hulme J) to the observations of Grove J in R v Todoroski [2010] NSWCCA 75. In that case, his Honour (with the concurrence of Allsop P (as his Honour then was) and Hislop J) said at [26]:

""...Every offence and every offender is different and the essential aim of all sentencing is to render individual justice. Comparable cases and statistics can be useful guides and departure from established sentencing patterns would require justification, but the exercise of sentencing discretion must be directed to fulfilment of the stated aim"".

90In the same case I also observed (at [64]) that in order to render the individual justice to which his Honour referred, care must be taken when the Court is asked to compare the sentence imposed in one case with the sentence imposed in another (as to which see RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236 at [132] per Bellew J, McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing; see also R v Nguyen and Pham (2010) 205 A Crim R 106; [2010] NSWCCA 238). 

91It is not necessary in the present circumstances to undertake an analysis of each of the cases to which the Court was referred for comparative purposes. It is sufficient for me to note that there are various features which distinguish such cases from that of the appellant. They are, in my view, of limited assistance in determining whether some other sentence is warranted. 

92I have had regard to the appellant's subjective circumstances. He is an obviously intelligent and well educated person of otherwise good character. His first marriage broke down as a result of his offending, and as a consequence he has been separated from his daughter since being taken into custody. Those circumstances, as well as the conditions of his incarceration set out in his affidavit, have rendered his sentence more onerous. As the sentencing judge found, his prospects of rehabilitation appear favourable and I am satisfied that the prospects of him re-offending are generally low. He has apparently formed a new relationship which will obviously assist his rehabilitation, as will the support that he enjoys from his family.
93The appellant's affidavit demonstrates that he has been a generally responsible inmate against whom no disciplinary findings have been made. It also evident that he has taken every step possible in terms of rehabilitation by seeking to enrol in appropriate treatment programs. Unfortunately, through no fault of his own, some of those programs have not been made available to him. 
94It is necessary however to balance all of those matters against the offending. 

95It was not the Crown case that the offending was planned. To the extent that there was a plan, it was one to have consensual intercourse with AB. However, even in the absence of any planning the offending was obviously serious. Having effectively adopted a false identity, the appellant lured AB to meet with him under a false pretence, and then brought her back to his office where he forced sexual intercourse upon her. The evidence of AB, in my view, overwhelmingly supported the conclusion that the appellant knew that she did not consent. 

96On the basis of AB's evidence the appellant continued to exploit her even after intercourse had taken place by telling her, in effect, that her ambition would be realised providing she did not divulge what had occurred. In doing so, the appellant continued to falsely represent to her that he was someone who could assist her career. 

97Moreover in my view, the appellant continues to demonstrate no remorse for his offending. In his affidavit of 8 May 2014, consistent with the tone of his letter to the sentencing judge, he continued to classify his conduct as a ""mistake"", explaining that he had ""missed what the victim was communicating"" when there were ""cues that (he) should have picked up on"". Those statements, in my view, significantly understate the true nature of the offending. Perhaps even more importantly, they reflect a continuing inability, or perhaps a refusal, on the part of the appellant to accept responsibility for his actions. 

98AB told the appellant, within a very short time of arriving at his office, that she had not gone there to have sex. That statement, and her subsequent distressed state, were not simply ""cues"". They were clear and unequivocal statements that she did not consent to sexual intercourse. In my view, it was not a matter of the appellant failing to ""pick up"" on them. Rather, it was a matter of the appellant making a conscious decision to ignore them, and to force penile/vaginal intercourse on AB. 

99For all of these reasons I am not satisfied that any other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.

100I propose the following order:

(1)The appeal is dismissed.

101HAMILL J: I have had the considerable benefit of reading the judgment in draft of his Honour Bellew J and I respectfully adopt his outline of the facts and analysis of the issues which arise on the appeal. For the most part I agree with his Honour's reasons and conclusions. However, I have come to a different conclusion as to the ultimate outcome of the appeal because I am of the opinion that a different, less severe, sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed. 

102For the reasons that Bellew J has given I agree that ground (1) should be upheld. 

103I agree with Bellew J that the result of upholding ground 1 is that it is not strictly necessary to consider grounds to 2-4 and, for that reason, I also agree that it is not necessary for the Court to concern itself on this appeal with the controversy surrounding whether, on a referral under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), it is necessary for an appellant to obtain leave to argue grounds that go beyond the scope of the referral. Full arguments in relation to that controversy are being considered by the Court, differently constituted, in the case of R v Luizos. In the circumstance where anything that the Court would say in this appeal would be obiter it seems to me to be inappropriate to express any conclusions in relation to the matter.

104Bellew J indicated that he would consider the matters raised under grounds 2-4 ""in the context of the exercise of the Court's function under s 6(3)."" In undertaking that exercise, his Honour rejected those grounds. I am not inclined to come to conclusions as to whether the sentencing Judge fell into error in the manner alleged by grounds 2, 3 and 4. I do not think that it is necessary to do so. I would consider the factual questions underpinning those grounds in the context of re-sentencing and in considering the operation of s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act. In other words, I would consider for myself whether I should come to a different factual conclusion as to the appellant's intention (ground 2), his remorse (ground 3) and the likelihood that he will re-offend (ground 4) taking into account the findings of Judge Payne SC, the evidence at first instance and the additional evidence tendered on ""the usual basis"" at the hearing of the appeal: cf Douar v The Queen [2005] NSWCCA 455 159 A Crim R 154 at [124]. 

105However, even though we take a slightly different route, I agree with Bellew J in relation to the outcome with respect to the matters raised in grounds (2) and (3). In particular, I am not persuaded that the applicant should necessarily be sentenced on the basis that the intention established was no more than holding an unreasonable belief that the complainant was consenting in accordance with s 61HA(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Similarly I am not persuaded that the evidence, even the evidence tendered on the appeal, establishes the mitigating factor of remorse as that concept is defined or restricted in s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

106In relation to the matter raised by ground (4), I agree with Bellew J that it was open to Payne DCJ to come to the conclusion as to the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation that she did. While it is arguable that her Honour did not take relevant material into account (that is, the opinion in the pre-sentence report) I am not persuaded that her Honour erred in that way. 

107However, in considering the question of sentence afresh, based on the evidence before this Court, I am satisfied on the balance of the probabilities that the appellant has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. The affidavit of the appellant sworn 8 May 2014 and the annexures to the affidavit of his solicitor show that he has made every effort to complete relevant rehabilitation programmes and has been a model prisoner. He has no previous convictions and the imposition of a substantial full time gaol sentence is likely to have had a salutary impact in terms of personal deterrence. Accordingly in assessing the appropriate sentence I take the view that the mitigating features in s 21A(3)(g) and (h) have been established.

108Sentencing has been described as an intuitive exercise. It is necessary to synthesise a diverse number of factors in order to settle upon a sentence which is considered by the sentencing judge or court to be just, proportionate, reasonable and appropriate. In many, if not most, cases the principles that guide the exercise of the sentencing discretion pull in different directions. Those principles find statutory form in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However those principles have existed for centuries in the criminal law of sentencing.

109It has been said many times that there is no single correct sentence: see, for example, R v Markarian [(2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357. It is inevitable that judicial minds will differ as to the appropriate sentence in any given case. When this Court is considering questions of manifest excess or manifest inadequacy, considerable deference is paid to the sentence settled upon by the sentencing judge. This is in recognition of both the advantage that the primary judge may have had in considering the material at first instance and the function within the judicial hierarchy of the sentencing judge: see, for example, Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 per Simpson J at [46]. Sentencing involves the exercise of a wide discretion. 

110However, this is not a case where the applicant asserts manifest excess. Rather it is a case where the applicant has established an error in the sentencing process such that this Court has held that the sentencing discretion miscarried.

111In my opinion the matters identified by Bellew J at [23]-[28] establish that that the sentencing judge approached the case on the basis of the law as it had been articulated in the case of R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. In Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 391, 244 CLR 120, the High Court held (at [25]) that R v Way was wrongly decided and that ""it was an error to characterise s 54B(2) as framed in mandatory terms"". A sentencing judge is not required to commence by asking ""whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period"". The High Court held (at [26]) that the introduction of the standard non-parole period did not involve a departure from accepted sentencing principles whereby:
""[T]he judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case.""

See Markarian v The Queen (supra) per McHugh J at 378 [51].

112The comments of the sentencing Judge set out by Bellew J at [23]-[28] establish that Judge Payne approached the standard non-parole period as framed in mandatory terms, made findings as to whether the case fell into the mid-range of objective seriousness and then started from the 7 year standard non-parole period before reducing the non-parole period to 5 years based on certain factors in the case - presumably, his prior good character and the finding of special circumstances. 

113This means that rather than taking into account all of the relevant considerations going to an assessment of an appropriate and just sentence, the sentencing judge commenced with a consideration of the standard non-parole period of 7 years and then looked for reasons to impose either a lesser or greater sentence. In light of the decision in Muldrock v R, that is an error of a fundamental nature. In fairness to Judge Payne SC, she was applying the law as it was then understood to be. 

114In considering the application of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act this Court must consider afresh the question of what is an appropriate sentence without particular reference to the sentence imposed at first instance. Having undertaken that task it is then necessary to consider whether the sentence considered to be appropriate is the same as, or more than, the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. If it is, the appeal will be dismissed. If it is not, the appeal will be upheld and the sentence considered appropriate by this Court will be imposed.

115That is at least my understanding of the operation of s 6(3) once error in the sentencing process has been established.

116The applicant has provided a significant body of material concerning the sentences imposed in other cases in an attempt to make good the submission that a less severe sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed. The proper approach to such material, as well as to statistics in other cases, was described by the High Court in the following passage from the case of Hili and Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]-[55] in which comments of Simpson J in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 were approved: 

""54. In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: 'Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.' But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix 'the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence'. Past sentences 'are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence' (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned.

55. As the plurality said in Wong:

'[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.'""

117I accept the caution with which material such as past sentencing outcomes and statistics must be taken and I agree generally with the observations of Bellew J in [86]-[90] of his judgement.

118However, such caution should not be taken too far. When, as here, the objective criminality of an offence does not appear to be at the top of the range and where, as here, the Court is dealing with a first offender with good prospects of rehabilitation, it is at least surprising and worthy of closer examination that the sentence imposed falls statistically and on the available case law in the higher echelons of the overall spectrum of sentences imposed for similar offences.

119I have taken into account the objective gravity of the offence and agree with Bellew J that it is a very serious offence. I accept that general deterrence must play an important role in the exercise. 

120However, it is far from the most serious offence of its kind and whilst the applicant's initial motivation was wicked (he hoped to trick the victim into having sex with him by pretending he was somebody he was not), the fact that he had no plan to sexually assault the complainant is a significant matter in an assessment of the objective gravity of the crime. 

121The applicant was a first offender and, as I have concluded, he is unlikely to offend again. The evidence adduced on the appeal shows that he has made every effort towards rehabilitation in the course of the period that he has been in custody. The provision in s 21A(3)(i) made the availability of remorse and/or contrition as a mitigating feature more restrictive. I do not think that the evidence adduced on behalf of the applicant establishes the matter.

122I have considered the body of material that was relied on by the applicant as establishing some kind of pattern of sentencing. Each case will turn on its own facts and this case is an unusual one. Accordingly, the outcomes in other cases must be treated with circumspection. With the same degree of caution, I have considered the cases upon which the applicant places particular reliance: R v JRB [2006] NSWCCA 371, Salmond v R [2010] NSWCCA 141, Sabapathy v R [2008] NSWCCA 82 and McCartney v R [2009] NSWCCA 244. 

123I have considered the purposes of sentencing in s. 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the relevant aggravating and mitigating features that exist under s. 21A, the maximum penalty of 14 years and the standard non-parole period of 7 years. 

124I have come to the conclusion that a sentence significantly less than that imposed at first instance is warranted and ought to have been imposed. I have reached this conclusion not as a result of the outcome in any particular case, or even the outcome in any group of cases, but rather on my own assessment of the objective gravity of this offence set against the relevant mitigating features and noting at all stages that the personal circumstances of the applicant cannot be given such weight as to allow the applicant to escape the appropriately stern punishment that his offending unquestionably deserves. 

125I would impose a sentence of 6 years. I would make a finding of special circumstances based around the fact that the applicant is a person who has not previously been in custody and will require considerable supervision upon his release from gaol. This finding, pursuant to the provisions of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, allows me to reduce what would otherwise be a non-parole period of 4½ years to a non-parole period of 4 years. There would then be a balance of term of two years which is ample time to allow the applicant to readjust to life in the community. 

126I am aware that this approach means that the non-parole period has already expired although the applicant's release to parole is a decision for the NSW Parole Authority. 

127Accordingly, the orders that I would favour are as follows:

(2)Appeal allowed

(3)Quash the sentence imposed by Judge Payne SC and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a non-parole period of four years commencing on 11 October 2009 and expiring on 10 October 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 11 October 2013 and expiring on 10 October 2015.

(4)The applicant became eligible for consideration for release on parole on 11 October 2013 and I recommend that his release to parole be given urgent consideration.

2764182,Lyndon v R [2014] NSWCCA 112,"HEADNOTE[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
At the time of the offences, TG and SG were seven year old twin sisters.  On 26 December 2010, they went to stay with their grandmother, Ms D.  Upon arrival at her home she discovered her husband had left her and became distressed.  The applicant, who lived next door, offered to look after SG and TG.  The following day TG told Ms D that the applicant had removed SG's pants and underpants and licked her genitals.  SG confirmed that had happened.  Further allegations were later made that the applicant had touched SG's breasts and had removed TG's pants and touched her genitals.
Five charges were laid against the applicant: two counts of indecent assault involving TG and two counts of indecent assault and a charge of sexual intercourse with a child under 10, in relation to SG.  At trial, the applicant was found guilty of one charge of indecent assault in removing SG's pants and the charge of sexual intercourse. He was acquitted of the other charges.   The applicant sought leave to appeal the convictions on the following grounds:
(i) the prosecutor in his closing address had improperly suggested an expertise in determining the credibility of children and had invited the jury to convict on the basis of a lie by the accused (ground 1);(ii) the trial judge failed to warn the jury about the use of tendency evidence (ground 3);(iii) the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable or unsupported by evidence (ground 4); (iv) the trial miscarried because defence counsel failed to lead available medical evidence regarding the accused's difficulties kneeling because of a back injury (ground 5).
The Court held (per Basten JA, Button J and RS Hulme AJ agreeing), refusing leave to appeal on ground 3 but granting leave to appeal on the other grounds but dismissing the appeal:
In relation to (i)(per Basten JA, Button J agreeing)
1. While the prosecutor's references to his own experience with children giving evidence in court were inappropriate and capable of causing prejudice, there was no realistic possibility of prejudice arising from his closing address read as a whole and in the context of the trial.  Any suggestion by the prosecutor that the accused may have lied or was untruthful was too unclear to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice: [24], [40]-[51]
R v Livermore [2006] NSWCCA 33; 67 NSWLR 659 applied.Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193 referred to.
(per Hulme AJ)
2. The statements made by the prosecutor were grossly improper, amounting to further evidence and irrelevant and inadmissible opinion. No miscarriage of justice arose, however, as the absence of any objection by defence counsel confirms the statements did not loom large in the prosecutor's closing address: [75]-[77]
KNP v R [2006] NSWCCA 213; 67 NSWLR 227 referred to.
In relation to (ii)
3. The verdicts were neither unreasonable nor unsupported on the evidence.  The proposition that the evidence of the twins was too unreliable to support convictions because of the possibility of concoction is not maintainable as that issue was not raised at trial, nor was any plausible explanation for concoction proffered: [67]-[70]
MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 applied.
In relation to (iii)
4. The prosecution did not seek to rely upon the applicant's acts involving one child as demonstrating a tendency to undertake the acts alleged involving the other child.  The judge warned the jury that each offence should be considered separately and that the jury should be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the allegation in each case.  No direction was sought as to tendency evidence in the course of trial: [58], [64]-[66].
Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 applied.KRM v The Queen [2001] HCA 11; 20 CLR 221 considered.
In relation to (iv)
5. Determining whether counsel's conduct results in a miscarriage of justice is an objective inquiry: the affidavit of the applicant's trial counsel as to the conduct of the trial is inadmissible.  The medical evidence would have confirmed the general understanding that the applicant had a back injury; it did not demonstrate he could not have done what the complainants described.  The trial did not miscarry through the incompetence of counsel in failing to call medical evidence with respect to the applicant's back condition: [52]-[57]  
TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 applied.




			Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  On 26 December 2010 seven year old twin sisters, identified throughout these proceedings as TG and SG, were being cared for by their grandmother (in fact their mother's step-mother), who lived in a town in northern New South Wales.  (Their home was in Queensland.)  The grandmother, Ms D, had driven the girls from Queensland, arriving at her home on the afternoon of 26 December.  On arrival, she discovered that her husband had left her.  The applicant lived next door.  On learning of Ms D's distress, he offered to look after the children at his house and to cook dinner for them.  (The names of the girls and the witnesses related to them are not used in these reasons in order to minimise the risk of a publication identifying the girls, in breach of s 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW).)  
2The girls did not stay for dinner, but returned to their grandmother's house.  The applicant later arrived with dinner.  It was arranged that the applicant would take the girls to the shops the following day and buy them ice creams.  However, before he arrived on the afternoon of 27 December, the girls told their grandmother that the applicant had removed SG's pants and underpants and licked her genitals.  Later that day, Ms D took the girls to the local police station.
3On the basis of the complaints, the applicant was charged in relation to TG with two offences of assault involving an act of indecency, contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and in relation to SG, two offences of assault involving an act of indecency and a further offence of sexual intercourse with SG, then being under 10 years of age.  He was found guilty by a jury on two counts against SG, but was acquitted of the other three charges.  On 23 November 2012 he was sentenced to an effective term of six years, with a non-parole period of three years dating from 26 October 2012.  The present application for leave to appeal is limited to the convictions: the notice of appeal was filed on 23 August 2013.
4The four grounds of appeal relied upon before this Court were:
""1. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the Crown Prosecutor's closing address to the jury.
...
3. The learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they could not use the evidence of acts alleged against one complainant as tendency evidence with respect to the acts against the other complainant.
4. The verdicts of the jury are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.
5. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the appellant's counsel to lead medical evidence supporting the appellant's evidence that he was unable to kneel at the time of the offences.""
5Following a hearing in this Court, on 14 March 2014, the applicant sought to re-open the hearing for the purpose of tendering an audio recording of the prosecutor's closing address.  The application was accompanied by an affidavit of the applicant's solicitor noting that counsel had instructed him to obtain the audio recording in August 2013, but that he had failed to take any steps until reminded by senior counsel three days before the hearing.  (Nothing was said at the hearing of the intention to invite the Court to listen to the audio recording.)  The applicant did not propose that there be a further oral hearing, but sought leave to file brief written submissions if the recording were admitted.  It is convenient to deal with this application in the course of considering ground 1 of the proposed appeal, which alleged that the prosecutor's address had caused the trial to miscarry.
6Before addressing the specific grounds of appeal, it is convenient to provide some further factual background by reference to the evidence adduced at the trial.
Summary of evidence7The principal lay witnesses for the prosecution were the girls, SG and TG, and their grandmother, Ms D.  The girls' mother also gave evidence, confirming the arrangements made for her daughters to travel to New South Wales and the events which followed the complaints.  The girls were returned the following day to their home in Queensland.  On 30 December she had identified with the complainants the clothes worn by SG on the day of the alleged offences.  Only SG was able to identify the pants which she had been wearing, for which DNA testing identified samples originating from more than one individual.  That person was not positively identified as the applicant, but the applicant could not be ruled out as a contributor to the sample.
8In relation to the two offences committed on SG, for which the jury convicted, there was evidence of SG herself and evidence from TG, who witnessed the offences.  With respect to the third offence (a touching of SG's chest), of which the applicant was acquitted, TG did not witness the conduct complained of.  Further, with respect to the two offences allegedly committed on TG (of which the applicant was acquitted), TG had originally denied any assaults when the girls first spoke to their grandmother on 27 December.  Further, her later complaints were not supported by SG, who did not see the conduct complained of taking place, beyond the applicant pulling down TG's pants.
9Counsel for the applicant accepted that there was a rational basis for the convictions and acquittals: the convictions relied upon the availability of supporting evidence from TG.  However, because TG's evidence was not, apparently, sufficient to satisfy the jury as to the offences committed on her, the applicant submitted that her evidence should not have been accepted as a sufficient basis for the allegations made by SG.
10The evidence in chief of SG involved a video recording undertaken by New South Wales police, but based on interviews recorded in Queensland. 
11SG said that after arriving at her grandmother's house, she went next door with a man, whom she identified as ""Nick"", but who was accepted to be the applicant.  The applicant's wife was not there.  The applicant put on a DVD of a cartoon which the girls watched while sitting on the lounge.  Initially, the applicant was in the kitchen.  At one point, SG went back to her grandmother's home to get a drink.  She said that the applicant and TG had been looking at a ""temporary tattoo"" which TG had on her belly.  The applicant then came over to the lounge ""pulled down our pants and our undies"" and ""started licking my nu-nu.""  She later said, ""I told him to stop but he kept going.""  That occurred whilst she was sitting down.  She said that the applicant was kneeling on the ground.  After that occurred, she said that she and her sister pulled up their pants and went back to their grandmother's house.  Although she said that he pulled TG's pants down, she denied that he otherwise touched TG.  She added that after he had licked her ""nu-nu"" (identified on a sketch diagram as her genital area) she said that he licked her belly and her ""boobies"".
12The first assault charge with respect to SG related to the pulling down of her pants, the sexual intercourse charge related to the licking of her genitals and the second assault charge licking her chest and nipples.
13In cross-examining SG, counsel for the applicant took her through her evidence up to the complaints made to the grandmother the following day, without touching on the allegations of assault.  He then obtained confirmation that it was TG who said to the grandmother words to the effect, ""The man next door licked [SG]"": Tcpt, 29/08/12, p 38(40).  Upon the grandmother expressing doubt, both girls said, ""It's true"".  SG was taken through her evidence of complaint with no suggestion that any aspect was untrue.
14Counsel then suggested to SG that her complaints about the applicant's conduct on the previous day were not true.  The only specific points of challenge to SG's credibility were two matters which were already apparent.  First, in her police interview, she had said that immediately after the assaults she and TG pulled up their pants and ran home, told their grandmother and locked up all the doors.  She agreed that that was not true: Tcpt, p 43(45).  Secondly, SG confirmed that at the time of the initial complaint TG had denied to her grandmother that the man had touched her (TG): Tcpt, p 39(5).  Counsel obtained a concession from SG that when TG denied being touched, she believed that to be true: Tcpt, p 47(25)-(50).  Nevertheless, she affirmed that the man did touch her sister: Tcpt, p 50(30).
15The cross-examiner also tried to elicit evidence that if the events complained of had actually happened, SG would have complained herself and would have complained immediately she returned to her grandmother's home.  He suggested that her request to her grandmother not to tell her mother was because the complaints were untrue: she denied that.  There was also a suggestion that the twins were very close to each other and that ""sometimes things that happen to your sister you feel they happen to you"", to which SG replied, ""I'm not sure"": Tcpt, p 50(15).  (The question seemed to imply that TG had been assaulted, but that SG had not.)
16It is unlikely that the cross-examination would have significantly undermined SG's credibility as a witness.  What was missing from the challenge to her evidence was any possible motive for lying to her grandmother (and maintaining the lie).  On the contrary, the cross-examiner elicited that the girls had never met the applicant before the day of the assaults; that they had enjoyed playing hide and seek with him in their grandmother's home before they went to his home, and that they willingly went to his home and watched a DVD.  
17While there was opportunity for the girls to have fabricated the story overnight, there was no express suggestion that they did that.  Their failure to complain on the evening of the events was a matter for the jury to assess; the apparent trigger for the complaint by TG was that they were about to be taken by the applicant (albeit in company with his wife) away from their grandmother's home.
18The evidence that SG gave with respect to the assaults on her sister was less convincing.  Not only did she agree with her sister's initial complaint that the applicant had touched her (SG) and not TG, but her account to the police of the assault on TG was merely that he had pulled her pants down at the same time he had pulled SG's pants down.  Although he told TG not to pull them up, there was no suggestion that he touched her at any other point.  After describing how he had licked her, SG said, ""we pulled our pants up, after he went away we pulled our pants up and then we ran home"": Tcpt of police interview (SG), Q137.
19TG's statement to the police alleged that the applicant had pulled her pants down while SG was at her grandmother's home.  TG also gave evidence of the applicant licking SG's genitals and said that after he had done that, he licked his finger and ""put it in, wiped my noo noo"": Tcpt of police interview with TG, Q139.
20In her police interview, TG was confused as to the timing of various events.  Her evidence as to what the applicant did to SG was consistent with SG's account.  Her statement that the applicant pulled her pants down was also consistent with SG's account.  However, she seemed to be saying that the applicant pulled her pants down on two separate occasions, the first being when SG was not in the room.  Further, her account of the applicant touching her genitals, which apparently took place in the presence of SG, was not confirmed by SG.  TG was cross-examined as to her account of the applicant's conduct with her sister, and confirmed that she had described what happened.  However, when it was put to her that the applicant did not pull her pants down, she answered, ""Not sure"": Tcpt, p 121(30).  The cross-examination concluded with the suggestion that ""[t]he man next door didn't wipe his finger or lick his finger and touch your noo-noo did he?""  TG replied, ""I don't remember"": Tcpt, p 123(20).  
21TG gave no evidence of the applicant licking or touching SG's chest.  
22On the basis of this evidence, it was unsurprising that the jury drew a clear distinction between the different charges, finding the applicant not guilty of both charges relating to TG and the last charge relating to touching SG's chest.  
Ground 1: closing address for prosecution23The first ground of appeal, which was dealt with at some length in submissions in this Court, alleged that the trial had miscarried because of statements made by the prosecutor in addressing the jury.
(a) general principles24The principles governing the proper conduct of a prosecutor in a jury trial were explained in R v Livermore [2006] NSWCCA 334; 67 NSWLR 659 at [24]-[52] (McClellan CJ at CL, Johnson and Latham JJ).  It is sufficient for present purposes to summarise the principles in two broad propositions, namely that:
(a) although the prosecution case should be presented in the best light, with appropriate firmness, that should be done with fairness and professional detachment, eschewing intemperate or inflammatory language;
(b) the case to be presented is that revealed by the evidence, with respect to which the personal opinions of the prosecutor are irrelevant and potentially distracting.
25These principles will operate differently depending upon the circumstances of the case.  Where the offending is inherently likely to inspire feelings of distaste or even revulsion which may cloud an impartial assessment of the evidence, particular care should be taken not to play on possible prejudice or emotion.  This case, involving allegations of sexual conduct with young children, although the circumstances were not the most serious of their kind, carried with it the risk of prejudice.  However, that was not the focus of concern in the present appeal.  Rather, the applicant relied upon a number of passages in which the prosecutor had expressed personal opinions about the evidence of young children, arguably implying a degree of expertise in assessing such evidence.  Before dealing with that material, it must be noted that no complaint was made at any stage during the trial by counsel for the accused.  By contrast, in Livermore, immediately after the prosecution addressed, counsel for the accused sought a discharge of the jury.
26There are two difficulties which commonly attend such challenges.  First, while the court has an obligation to intervene where satisfied that a trial has substantially miscarried, in addressing a challenge to a conviction, the court is conscious of the limitations attending any attempt to assess the fairness of a trial on the basis of a transcript of what was said.  Secondly, there are things that are not said: thus, the defence may make tactical decisions as to how a trial should be run which are not directly revealed in the transcript or any other record of the trial.
27The first difficulty may be lessened by inviting the court either to listen to an audio recording of what was said in the course of a trial or, if available, to view a video recording.  The second difficulty may be overcome if the representatives of the accused (or the accused himself or herself) is allowed to present evidence of tactical decisions which were or were not made.
28There are problems attending the latter course, even when evidence is sought to be adduced from trial counsel as to why a particular course was taken.  (In this case evidence was tendered from trial counsel, but not in relation to this point.)  However, the underlying issue remains: counsel for the applicant took no objection at trial to any part of the prosecutor's address and did not seek either a discharge of the jury or directions from the judge to ameliorate the supposed prejudicial effect.  Generally, an accused should not sit by and note errors occurring in the conduct of a trial for use in a subsequent appeal.  On the contrary, if a potential flaw is foreseen, steps should be taken to avoid that occurring, or to ameliorate its effect once it has occurred.  Consistently with this approach, the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) provide:
4 Exclusion of certain matters as grounds for appeal etc
No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.
29Rule 4 was said not to operate in the present case because no direction from the trial judge would have been adequate to overcome the effect of the prosecutor's address.  However, that is not an adequate answer, for two reasons.  First, if a direction had been thought necessary and had been sought and given, the appeal would then be concerned with an assessment of whether the steps taken by the trial judge were adequate in all the circumstances.  The fact that no direction was sought explains the omission by the trial judge, but does not take the case outside the operation of r 4.  Secondly, it should not be assumed that the principle underlying r 4 does not operate because the rule does not in terms deal with a discharge of the jury.  The principle identified above imposes on both parties, as well as the court, obligations with respect to the running of a trial before a jury.  If the circumstances appear to call for the jury to be discharged, such an order should be sought and its appropriateness debated by those at the trial.
(b) tender of audio recording30The applicant did seek to address the first difficulty noted above, namely the limitations of acting on a transcript.  He invited the Court, belatedly, to listen to an audio recording of the prosecutor's address.  That course was opposed by the Director.  There are four reasons why the invitation should not be accepted.
31First, the substance of the complaint is not inflammatory or intemperate language, but the expression of irrelevant opinions.  It will be necessary to turn to those opinions shortly, but their combined effect was summarised by the applicant in the following terms:
""When viewed as a whole the Crown prosecutor's address risked giving the jury the impression that the prosecutor had a particular expertise with respect to children.  Various parts of the address conveyed to the jury that aspects of the complainant's [sic] evidence and the manner in which it was tested, were such that the evidence had a particular veracity, based on the prosecutor's particular expertise.""
There would be a stronger case for inviting this Court to listen to an audio recording if the complaint were of inflammatory language or, indeed, language which did not appear to be inflammatory on its face, but was delivered in an inflammatory manner, a characteristic which might be revealed by an audio recording.
32Secondly, the applicant submitted that the limited role of the prosecutor's address meant that the recording could be listened to satisfactorily in isolation from other aspects of the trial.  That exercise would not involve the potential for misleading which might attend listening to (or even viewing) the evidence of one witness only (such as a video recording of a complainant's evidence), giving it an immediacy which is not replicated with respect to other witnesses.  That factor may be accepted, but it does not address the broader issue as to the function of the appellate court.  
33The increasingly common circumstance that the Court is asked to review the whole of the evidence in order to assess a challenge that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, imposes a significant practical burden on the operation of the Court.  The additional burden of listening to parts of the trial (let alone the whole trial) or, as the availability of video recording increases, viewing the whole of the trial, raises a serious question as to the proper function of the Court and the allocation of public resources to allow it to carry out that function.  That is not to say that, in a proper case where good reason is shown, the Court will not listen to an audio recording or a video recording of a trial.  Rather, it is to say that good reason for taking such a course must be established: that was not revealed in the present case.  See, with respect to a request that the Court listen to an audio recording of the judge's summing up, Versi v R [2013] NSWCCA 206 at [5]-[9].
34Thirdly, there is the fact that no objection was taken to the prosecutor's manner of addressing the jury, either during the address or thereafter.  If counsel for the applicant had been concerned that the prosecutor was exceeding the proper bounds of his position, that complaint should have been raised at the first reasonably available opportunity.  Interruption of the address is to be discouraged, but objection can be raised at a convenient break in proceedings.  That was not done. 
35Fourthly, there is the fact that the audio recording was proffered only after the hearing of the appeal had been completed.  It may be accepted that counsel for the applicant had considered the possibility of inviting the Court to listen to the audio recording more than a year before the hearing, but that the solicitor (according to his own affidavit) had failed, without any apparent reason other than forgetfulness, to take the necessary steps to obtain the audio recording.  It may further be assumed that until the recording was obtained counsel had no firm basis for knowing whether the Court should be invited to listen to it: were that not so, one would have expected that the Court would have been warned during the hearing that the audio recording was being sought and would be tendered when it became available.  That did not happen.  The solicitor's affidavit stated that counsel had since listened to the recording and formed the view that ""the Court may be assisted by listening to the recording.""  No basis for that view was provided.
36Mistakes can be made in the preparation for a hearing.  Where a mistake is made by a legal representative which has potentially prejudiced the position of his or her client, the court will, so far as practicable, seek to deal with the matter in a way which diminishes any perceived prejudice to the party who is not individually at fault.  
37The Court sought clarification from senior counsel as to whether the applicant sought to reopen the hearing and was advised that that was not sought; rather it was proposed to file a brief written submission, but noting that the impact of the address ""is ultimately based on impression.""
38The application should be refused for three reasons.  First, the unsatisfactory procedural errors cannot be entirely disregarded.  If the audio recording has some (as yet) unidentified significance, both parties should be given an opportunity to address the issue.    Secondly, it should not be left to the Court to identify that issue.  Thirdly, although the application relates to an address, rather than evidence or the summing up, there is still a difficulty in placing it in the context of the trial and in knowing how it would have been perceived by those present.
(c) impugned statements of prosecutor39Returning to the primary submission, it is necessary to refer to the passages relied upon by the applicant as demonstrating that a miscarriage had occurred.
40The complaints about the prosecutor's address ranged across a number of different issues.  The primary complaint, however, was that the prosecutor purported to tell the jury, on the basis of his experience and expertise, that children, generally, can be relied upon to tell the truth.  Thus he said at Tcpt, 03/09/12, p 4(10):
""A great many people would have difficulty accepting a child's word over an adult saying that they are wrong.  No[w] there is no evidence in the trial and as far as the Crown knows, no evidence at all that children are any more or less likely to tell lies on their oath in a court.  [SG] and [TG] are nine.  Some people would say well, kids fantasise.  The Crown says to you that you know, you know, from your own childhood from your children or grandchildren, that kids know the difference between their fantasies and what happened to them in real life.""
41Subsequently, in dealing with the police interviews with the complainants, the prosecutor noted that some questions were repeated and asserted that ""it is dangerous to repeatedly ask little kids the same question because they get the impression they've given you the wrong answer and will change it"": Tcpt, p 12(25).  In fact, SG did not change her answers: this, the prosecutor said, indicated that SG ""was a very honest witness"": Tcpt, p 12(40).
42Referring to the apparent consistency of her answers in cross-examination the prosecutor submitted, at some length, that SG came through ""unscathed"" which was ""a difficult thing"", given the length of the questioning: Tcpt, p 13(35)-(45).  The prosecutor further stated (Tcpt, p 13(20)):
""In the Crown's respectful submission to you it would be within your knowledge of children that well and truly exceeded her attention span, which is about 20 or 30 seconds.  But in any event she said there, she did her best, she listened [to] those questions and she agreed with them because there isn't any dispute.""
43These passages may be assessed together.  Given the relative brevity of the trial, the prosecutor's address was somewhat prolix and, to an extent, argumentative.  There is no doubt that the prosecutor was entitled to identify circumstances which tended to demonstrate the reliability and credibility of the complainants; that included a consideration of the statements made in the police interviews and the effectiveness or otherwise of the cross-examination.  However, it was not appropriate for the prosecutor to purport to call in aid his own experience with children giving evidence in court to suggest that children were or were not generally truthful.  Such statements were inappropriate for two reasons: first, the task of the jury was to consider, against their general experience, whether these particular complainants were telling the truth and were reliable in the evidence they gave for the purpose of the proceedings.  The prosecutor's opinions were an irrelevant distraction.  Secondly, and more significantly, by calling in aid the authority of his office, the first statement at least had a tendency to suggest that there was particular information, not within the knowledge or experience of the jury, suggesting that these complainants should be believed.  To that extent, the remarks had a prejudicial tendency.
44As counsel for the applicant accepted, the early remarks by the prosecutor with respect to the credibility of children generally probably involved an attempt, inept, unnecessary and inappropriate, to reflect the policy underlying s 165A of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) which prohibits a judge from warning the jury that ""children as a class are unreliable witnesses"" or that the evidence of children as a class is ""inherently less credible or reliable, or requires more careful scrutiny, than the evidence of adults"".  For a prosecutor to wander into this territory without careful forethought risks putting the trial judge in the awkward position of needing to correct any inappropriate or distracting statement, without contravening s 165A(1).  
45Further, in commenting on the police interviewing technique and upon the cross-examination, he was implying that the ""system"" was unfair to child witnesses and the fact that their evidence was apparently unshaken was a stronger indication of their truthfulness and reliability than might otherwise have been the case.  Again, it may be accepted that these statements had a prejudicial tendency, but it is difficult to treat them as significant.  Whether the jury would have made anything at all of the proposition that the attention span of a nine year old was about ""20 or 30 seconds"" may be doubted.  
46Two other passages were the subject of challenge, but on a rather different basis.  Thus, the prosecutor spent several sentences noting that children, because of their youth and lack of experience, were naïve.  This passage culminated with the proposition that ""[g]ood children who believe what we tell them need to be watched and protected because they are so vulnerable, because they are so naïve, because of their inexperience"": Tcpt, p 4(30).  
47On one view, this was an irrelevant flourish and an example of ill-discipline.  As counsel for the applicant correctly submitted, ""there was no issue that children should be cared for and not be sexually abused.""  He went further, however, suggesting that the remarks ""had a tendency to arouse prejudice on the part of the jury and deflect them from their true task.""  Again, it may be accepted that the potential for such an effect was present; it was unrealistic, however, to think that, in the course of days of evidence and directions, this irrelevancy could have had any material effect.  That is not to condone the impropriety of the remarks.
48Finally, the applicant complained of a passage directed not so much to the evidence of the complainants, as that of the applicant.  However, the remarks were made in the context of the unqualified evidence of the complainants that when he licked SG's genitals, he was kneeling.  The prosecutor stated (Tcpt, p 10(25)):
""The accused said why he couldn't kneel.  It is a matter for you.  Can't get down on his knees for his own sexual gratification when on the Crown case he has a few wines, it is a matter for you.  Whether that helps him or not because it is a worry when people and [sic] come and say things are impossible when you might not be at all convinced that they are impossible.  It is a matter for you what you make of that.""
49This passage involved a digression in the course of the prosecutor's address: at no point did he return to the specific evidence of the accused that his back injury prevented him from kneeling.  The passage is inarticulate: what it was intended to convey is unclear.  The applicant submitted that the jury was being invited to convict on the basis of a lie told by the applicant and indeed to use it as an admission without being satisfied that it was a lie, but rather if not satisfied that the statement was true.  That approach, it was submitted, would have been inconsistent with the correct approach to the use of lies by an accused person, as discussed in Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193.  
50It would undoubtedly have been better if this confusing passage had been left out of the prosecutor's address.  Nevertheless, this was not the judge's direction to the jury and it is by no means clear that the jury would have understood it in the way proposed by counsel for the applicant.  No doubt it was capable of being misunderstood, but that would be insufficient to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice.
51The first and last passages complained of provided the strongest basis for an allegation of miscarriage based upon the prosecutor's address.  However, when the address is read as a whole, in the context of the trial as a whole, it is not possible to conclude that there was any realistic possibility of prejudice arising from these statements.  It was not insignificant that the trial judge did stop the prosecutor at one stage, when he rambled too far from the facts of the case, although in a context which, as the applicant conceded, was not prejudicial.  Further, counsel for the applicant at trial made no complaint of the prosecutor's address in respect of any of the passages referred to in this Court.  In these circumstances, the challenge based on the prosecutor's address must be rejected.
Failure of counsel for the accused to lead medical evidence52It is convenient to deal at this stage with the additional ground (ground 5) which contended that there had been a miscarriage resulting from the absence of available medical evidence to support the accused's statement that his back injury prevented him from kneeling, in the fashion described by the complainants.  
53In support of this ground, the applicant sought to read an affidavit of his instructing solicitor and an affidavit of trial counsel, Mr Roser.  The solicitor's affidavit may be dealt with briefly.  In October 2013 (after the trial), he obtained an opinion from Dr Patrick, general and vascular surgeon, as to the applicant's disabilities arising from disc deterioration in his lumbar spine.  Dr Patrick did not examine the applicant, but was provided with X-ray and CT images, and radiologists' reports.  He noted that for two years prior to October 2012 the applicant ""was suffering from a number of conditions including chronic low back pain (for which he was medically retired due to a L3 (actually L4/5 - WP) disc prolapse)"": Report, 16 October 2013, p 3.9.  He also suffered from other conditions, including osteoarthritis of the knees and hips and morbid obesity.  Dr Patrick's opinion was, relevantly, as follows:
""Following perusal of all this material, I am not in a position to make dogmatic comment, but I do believe that on balance of probability it is likely that at the time of the alleged offenses (December 2010) that Mr Christopher Lyndon would have found it difficult at the least to get into a kneeling position on the floor at the front of a large couch.  Getting himself into such a position cannot I believe be said to have been impossible for him but it is likely that such movements would not have been able to be carried out readily or quickly, and it is likely that he would have needed to be able to use his arms as well to support himself either on some part of the couch or adjacent stable furniture in order to lower himself to the floor.  As well as his significant back problem with sciatica he apparently was also suffering from significant osteoarthritic change at hips and knees.
It is likely that he would have had difficulty maintaining such position for more than a brief period.""
54Counsel's affidavit acknowledged that he was aware that the applicant suffered a serious back problem prior to trial, that he had discussed with his solicitor the possibility of obtaining medical evidence and concluded that it was not readily available.  He said that he did not consider engaging a suitable expert to provide medical evidence at trial as he believed that the jury would have realised from the applicant's appearance that he was physically incapacitated.  Finally, he stated that he ""did not make a deliberate forensic decision that it was in the appellant's best interests to not call evidence of this kind at the trial.""  Such statements are intended to deflect the criticism that an appeal is brought on a basis deliberately eschewed at trial.
55The admissibility of such evidence may be doubted: as stated by Gaudron J (Gummow and Hayne JJ agreeing) in TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [27] in considering whether decisions taken by counsel might contribute to a miscarriage of justice:
""One matter should be noted with respect to the question whether counsel's conduct is explicable on the basis that it resulted or could have resulted in a forensic advantage.  That is an objective test.  An appellate court does not inquire whether the course taken by counsel was, in fact, taken for the purpose of obtaining a forensic advantage, but only whether it is capable of explanation on that basis.""
56On this authority, counsel's affidavit was inadmissible, because irrelevant.  To the extent that it might be considered relevant, it confirmed that which could readily be identified from a general understanding of the case, namely that medical evidence was considered but not called on an entirely rational basis, namely that it was unnecessary: see TKWJ at [16] (Gleeson CJ).  Indeed, had counsel had available to him at trial Dr Patrick's later report, it is by no means certain that he would have sought to rely upon it.  The report did not support the applicant's evidence that it would have been ""impossible"" for him to kneel, merely stating that he would probably have ""found it difficult"" to get into a kneeling position.  The opinions were highly qualified.
57This material provides no adequate basis for considering that the trial miscarried through the incompetence of counsel in failing to call medical evidence with respect to the applicant's back condition.  Ground 5 must be rejected.
Tendency evidence: failure to give direction58Ground 3 alleged that the trial judge should have directed the jury that they could not use the evidence of acts alleged against one complainant as ""tendency evidence"" with respect to the acts against the other complainant.  The principle underlying this proposition was that such evidence must constitute ""tendency evidence"", that is that such conduct indicated that the applicant had a tendency to act in a particular way, from which it may be inferred that he did act as the complainant alleged.  The tendency rule requires that the prosecution give notice to the accused of its intention to adduce such evidence and that the Court be satisfied that the evidence has significant probative value: Evidence Act, s 97(1).  As explained by Anderson, Williams and Clegg, The New Law of Evidence (LexisNexis, 2nd ed, 2009) at 361:
""The inferential reasoning processes for tendency and coincidence evidence are dangerous because they permit a person to be judged by his or her conduct on other occasions rather than by evidence directly or indirectly focused on the subject event.""
59The prosecution did not seek to rely upon the conduct of the applicant with respect to SG to establish the offences committed against TG, or vice versa.  However, relying upon a passage from the judgment of McHugh J in KRM v The Queen [2001] HCA 11; 206 CLR 221 at [38], the applicant submitted that where multiple counts involving similar offences, but different victims, were heard together, ""a propensity warning will almost certainly be required.""
60This remark is of little assistance in the present case.  First, KRM involved a particular statutory charge of ""maintaining a sexual relationship with a child under the age of 16"" and separate counts relating to specific offences, albeit with the same victim.  Secondly, the proposition should be read in context.  The passage at [38] commenced, ""[i]n some cases of multiple counts, however, some feature of the evidence may create a risk that the jury will use that particular evidence or a conviction in respect of a count to reason that the accused is the kind of person who would commit the crime charged in another count or counts"".  Further, at [39] McHugh J stated:
""In some cases, giving the warning may excite the very prejudice that it purports to eliminate.  And if evidence has been admitted generally as propensity evidence, it is difficult to see how a propensity direction is ever required.""
61Thirdly, other members of the Court expressed views as to the need for a ""warning"" in different language.  Fourthly, the Court was dealing not only with a statutory offence under Victorian legislation, but with the common law, absent the Evidence Act.
62As explained by RA Hulme J in Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [33], there are ""three types of warnings often given to juries in relation to uncharged acts in a sexual assault trial (substitution of evidence of other acts for evidence of the offences charged, that the accused had a tendency to commit offences of the type charged, and reasoning that because the accused committed the uncharged act he/she committed the offence(s) charged).""
63Jiang shared with the present case the characteristic that the offences charged all occurred within a matter of minutes.  (The allegations involved three acts which occurred during the course of a massage and overstepped the legitimate boundaries, thus constituting sexual assaults.)  The Court in Jiang accepted that the need for a warning depended upon ""whether there was a significant risk that the jury might have embarked on impermissible tendency reasoning having regard to the evidence placed before it and the arguments of counsel"": Toalepai v R [2009] NSWCCA 270 at [49] (Howie J); Jiang at [44].
64The reason why, in the present case, the absence of a warning was said to have led to a miscarriage was that had the evidence of one complainant been capable of use as tendency evidence in respect of the other, the jury should have been told that they could not so use evidence as to the conduct on one count as supporting the allegations with respect to another count unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the evidence on the first count.
65This was not a case in which the jury was likely to reason impermissibly on the basis of a tendency to act in a particular way.  The important warning, which was given on more than one occasion, was that each offence should be considered separately and the jury be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the allegation in each case.  That this was how the evidence was presented, and how counsel dealt with the evidence in their addresses, as well as the manner in which the trial judge dealt with it in summing up, is confirmed by the verdicts.  It may be inferred that TG's original denial that the applicant had done anything bad to her, together with the absence of evidence from SG that she saw any untoward conduct with respect to TG, formed the rational basis for rejecting the counts with respect to TG.  Similarly, the absence of suggestion by TG that the applicant had touched SG on the chest provided a rational basis for rejecting that count with respect to SG.  By contrast, with respect to allegations as to the applicant's conduct against SG on which the jury convicted, there was support in the evidence of both SG and TG.  
66No objection was raised to the failure to give a warning as to tendency evidence at any stage in the course of the trial.  Accordingly, the ground cannot be relied upon without leave: Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4.  The failure to request such a warning is consistent with the inference drawn above, namely that no party in the course of the trial thought that such a warning was necessary.  Leave to rely upon ground 3 should be refused.
Unreasonable verdict: ground 467Finally, the applicant relied upon there being a miscarriage on the basis that the verdicts were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence.  The applicant accepted that there was a logical basis (discussed above) on which the verdicts of guilt and acquittal could be explained.  However, the applicant maintained that the consistency between the verdicts involved the proposition that neither SG's evidence alone, nor that of TG alone, was sufficient to support satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt.  That proposition may be accepted: however, the further proposition that the evidence of each was ""so unreliable"" as not to provide support for the counts to which it related is not maintainable.  As explained in the joint reasons of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [34], failure to accept the evidence of the complainant, in the face of denial by the accused, without other supporting evidence, may involve neither rejection of the complainant's evidence nor acceptance of the accused's evidence.
68In apparent support of the claim that the evidence of SG, which was essential to a finding of guilt, was ""highly unreliable"", reference was made to the fact that no complaint was made until the following day and that, in the interval, the complainants were together and ""there was clearly opportunity for concoction.""
69There were, however, two difficulties with that submission.  First, the possibility of concoction was not raised when it should have been, in cross-examining the complainants.  Inevitably in that circumstance, it was not put to the jury.  The second difficulty, of which the first is a reflection, is that the defence had no plausible explanation as to why the girls would have concocted the complaints.  They had never met the applicant before the afternoon in question; he was clearly supportive of their grandmother for whom they had undisputed affection; they were happy playing hide and seek with him at their grandmother's home shortly before the events which formed the charges and, although there was delay in complaining, the first complaint was made when it was suggested that the girls go out with the applicant again, on the following afternoon.
70A consideration of the evidence of each complainant and the applicant was a matter for the jury.  The significance of the evidence has been sufficiently discussed above to demonstrate that the prosecution case provided a basis for conviction, at least with respect to the counts upon which the jury convicted.  The verdicts were neither unreasonable nor unsupportable on the evidence.  Ground 4 has not been made out.
Conclusion71In these circumstances, leave to appeal should be refused with respect to ground 3, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4.  Ground 2 was abandoned.  Leave to appeal should be granted pursuant to s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in respect of grounds 1, 4 and 5.  The appeal should be dismissed.
72BUTTON J:  I agree with Basten JA.  On my own assessment of the evidence, the verdicts are not unreasonable or unable to be supported.
73RS HULME AJ:  I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA and, subject to one matter with his Honour's reasons.
74I do not go as far as his Honour in concluding that ""it is not possible to conclude that there was any realistic possibility of prejudice arising from"" the Prosecutor's statements that were the subject of the First Ground of the Appeal.
75The statements were grossly improper.  They were calculated to put before the jury what in practical terms amounted to further evidence and the irrelevant and inadmissible Prosecutor's opinion.  See also KNP v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 213; (2006) 67 NSWLR 227.
76And there were further inappropriate remarks by the prosecutor that are not the subject of appeal.  Time after time the Crown prosecutor addressed the jury in terms, ""The Crown says ..."", an expression significantly stronger in its import than the language of submission or suggestion which is the appropriate form an address should take.
77However, that exception was not taken at the trial by counsel then appearing for the Applicant tends to suggest that in the overall context of the Prosecutor's address the statements did not loom large.  Consideration of the printed transcript confirms that conclusion.  In the result despite my view as to the possibility of prejudice, I am satisfied that in fact there was no miscarriage of justice.

2764183,Khawaja v R [2014] NSWCCA 80,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  I agree with RS Hulme AJ.
2BUTTON J:  I agree with the orders proposed by RS Hulme AJ, and with his Honour's reasons.  I wish to add some very brief comments of my own. 
3As for ground 1, it is true that the learned sentencing judge did not comply with s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Act"").  It is also true that the approach adopted may have hindered the sentencing judge's reflection upon the degree of implicit accumulation in the aggregate sentence ultimately imposed.  That is one reason why the steps outlined by RS Hulme AJ should be undertaken in the order envisaged by the statute.  However, it is impossible to say that that hindrance actually occurred.  Because of that impossibility, I would not uphold ground 1.
4As for ground 2, it calls for consideration of whether the degree of accumulation implicit in the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive.  As a matter of mathematics, if the correct approach had been undertaken, his Honour would have provided two indicative head sentences of imprisonment for 3 years 9 months with regard to two separate criminal incidents.  In those circumstances, I do not regard the degree of accumulation implicit in an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for 6 years as manifestly excessive. 
5As for ground 3, I consider that it was open to the broad discretion reposed in a sentencing judge to reduce modestly the aggregate non-parole period from 4 years and 6 months to 4 years. 
6RS HULME AJ:  On 7 December 2012 the above named Applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by GD Woods DCJ in respect of two offences, robbery armed with an offensive weapon committed on 28 January 2012, and assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon, committed on 5 February 2012.  Both offences arise under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which prescribes a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment for each offence.  
7The sentence imposed by his Honour was an aggregate sentence of 6 years including a non-parole period of 4 years, both such periods commencing on 21 April 2012.  His Honour found special circumstances.
8The grounds of appeal are:
(1)His Honour erred in his application of the aggregate sentencing provisions
(2)The degree of accumulation is manifestly excessive
(3)His Honour failed to give adequate effect to his finding of special circumstances
9The circumstances of the offences - I summarise Judge Woods remarks - were:
"" ... on Saturday 28 January 2012 after midnight the offender went to a 7-Eleven convenience store intending to rob it.  The DVD ... shows a gentleman behind the counter doing his normal business serving people and then along comes the offender disguised with a hoodie and a peaked cap to cover up his face and wearing gloves.  He lurks behind the other customers until he gets the opportunity of going to the counter.  When the other people have gone he produces a very large knife ... 
It is a very frightening instrument and he leaned over the counter putting the knife towards the victim's body and saying, ""Open the fucking till otherwise I will chop you.""  He demanded money and told him to hurry up.  The sensible victim opened the cash register, grabbed the notes that were in there and pushed them to the offender who took them.  There was about $600 in notes and $76 in coins.
A week or so after that, Sunday 5 February, the offender repeated the exercise with a co-offender at the 7-Eleven in Rockdale.  Again, the photographs show hooded figures, a frightening looking knife, the same technique, an approach to the counter, the words, Give me the fucking money"" to which the frightened worker says, ""Don't hurt me I have two kids take what you want.""
The offender was unable in fact to open the cash register.  Fortunately for the victim (and for the offenders, no doubt) a man pulled into the service station and, being interrupted, the offender and his mate decamped."" 
10On 10 December 2010 in respect of a charge of affray, the Applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment for 10 months and 22 days commencing on 19 January 2010.  The length of the sentence obviously accorded with his pre-sentence custody.
11In May 2012 he was charged with breaking, entering and stealing and in September 2012 sentenced to imprisonment for 4 months commencing on 21 February 2012.  The commencing date of the sentence under appeal was 2 months prior to the end of the 4 months sentence.
12On 7 February 2012 he had been charged with possessing a prescribed restricted substance and having custody of a knife in a public place.  The most significant sentence for these offences, imposed in June 2012, was a 12 months bond.
13Turning to the Applicant's subjective circumstances, Judge Woods observed, inter alia:
""(The Applicant) was born in Australia of Lebanese migrants.  He had trouble at school.  He got into drugs.  His parents attempted to put him on the straight and narrow by taking him to Lebanon. ... He found the cheap hashish in Lebanon attractive.  He came back to Australia drug addicted and he continued to be drug addicted in the following years.
...
It is a significant consideration in mitigation that he is very young - young and stupid in this conduct but nonetheless young and not without some prospect of success in the future.""
14The Applicant was born in June 1991.  He was allowed a 25% discount for his plea.
Ground 115The statutory provision which forms the foundation for this ground is s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  That section provides:
(1) A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.
(2) A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under the section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the following:
(a) the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed,(b) the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.....
(5) An aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.
16What his Honour said was (at [AB12]):
""This is an appropriate case in which I should employ the provision of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  I will set an aggregate sentence for both offences. If I were sentencing for each offence separately I would have imposed in each case a sentence of imprisonment for five years for each offence, accumulating those in part to total a sentence of eight years.  I adopt that figure as an hypothetical aggregate.  From that figure I allow a discount of twenty-five percent representing the early plea of guilty, reflecting what I accept to be a genuine remorse and some assistance in the administration of justice.""
17It was contended on behalf of the Crown that his Honour's reference to ""5 years for each offence"" and ""a discount of 25%"" was sufficient to, as required by s 53A ""indicate"" the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence.  While, to anyone experienced in this field, it would be easy to deduce what his Honour had in mind, a step is required to apply the 25% to each of the 5 year periods as distinct from applying it to the ""hypothetical aggregate"".  Given that, I do not regard what his Honour said as complying with the statutory obligation to ""indicate to the offender and make a record of ... the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence ... had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence"".
18Section 53A(2) is clearly directed to ensuring transparency in the process of imposing an aggregate sentence and in that connection, imposing a discipline on sentencing judges.  While the subsection does not in terms require that his Honour ""state"" that, but for his decision to impose an aggregate sentence, he would have imposed a sentence for each offence of 3 years and 9 months but only to ""indicate"" that is what he would have done, clearly to ""state"" that sentence would have been the simplest way of complying with the section.
19Thus I accept the submissions made on behalf of the Applicant that his Honour did not comply with the terms of s 53A.  That said, s 53A(5) makes it clear that the sentence imposed is not thereby invalidated and there is nothing to indicate that his Honour's non-compliance resulted in a sentence greater than it otherwise would have been.  The same result could have been achieved in the imposition of two sentences in a variety of ways.
20Under the aegis of this ground it was also submitted that his Honour erred by ""arriving at the starting point for the aggregate sentence by accumulating on a notional starting point of 5 years imprisonment"".  
21His Honour's language, particularly his use of the words ""accumulating those"" makes it clear that in arriving at his figure of 8 years he added to the figure of 5 years for one of the sentences.  However, while on its own that approach is not compliance with s 53A, there is nothing in the section to prohibit the ultimate working out of the sentence in this way.  
Ground 222It was submitted, correctly, that the application of the 25% discount for an early plea to which his Honour referred would reduce the figure of 5 years to one of 3 years and 9 months and that, to arrive at his ultimate aggregate figure of 6 years his Honour must have accumulated on account of the second offence a sentence of 2 years and 3 months (and implicitly limited the period of concurrency to 18 months).  The former, it was submitted, is manifestly excessive, particularly when regard is had to the fact that the sentence imposed by his Honour was directed to commence 2 months after the commencement of a 4 months sentence previously imposed on the Applicant for another offence. 
23In support of the submission, it was urged on behalf of the Applicant that the offences were effectively part of a continuing episode of criminality during a period when the Applicant was abusing drugs.  This is not an adequate description of the situation.  The offences were committed nine days apart.  They had their own discrete victims.  If 3 years and 9 months' imprisonment was appropriate for one of the offences it is not obvious that a further 2 years and 3 months for a second offence is manifestly excessive.  I accept that other judges may have accumulated to a lesser extent but as Simpson J observed in R v Hammond (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7], ""There will be many cases in which sentencing judges might take differing views but neither view could be said to be wrong"". 
24In R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 at [46] this Court endorsed remarks of Sully J in R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [36]-[37].  In the passage referred to, his Honour had said:
"" ... (There) is the need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice; and, in particular, to ensure that there does not emerge in the community at large a perception that there is not all that much to choose between the person who commits one or two offences, and the person who commits six or seven offences, for the reason that somehow or other they all manage to finish up with effective sentences between or among which there is hardly anything in practical terms to choose.""
25Those remarks may fairly be adapted to circumstances where a sentence for two offences is compared with a sentence for only one.  
26The extent to which sentences are accumulated or made concurrent is to a substantial degree a matter of discretion.  I am by no means persuaded that in this case Woods DCJ was not within the legitimate exercise of his discretion when he accumulated the sentences as he did.
Ground 327Looking only at the sentence which his Honour imposed, the application of the usual statutory ratio would have involved a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months and a 1 year 6 months balance of term.  Having found special circumstances his Honour reduced the non-parole period to 4 years (or 4 years and 2 months if the earlier sentence is taken into account) and extended the balance of term to 2 years.  
28On behalf of the Applicant it is submitted that taking into account his youth and past problem with drugs this period of supervision is inadequate to foster his rehabilitation after such a lengthy period of incarceration.
29There was no evidence to that effect, the Court being simply asked to rely on its own experience of such matters.  My experience provides no basis for the submission.  Many young offenders, with serious drug problems, fall to be sentenced for lesser criminality than exhibited by the Applicant's offences and receive sentences and balances of term when eligible for supervised parole much shorter than that imposed on the Applicant.  The proposition that all such offenders need, or should have, their balances of term extended to over 2 years would throw sentencing in this state on its head and is fundamentally flawed.
30In any event, under the sentence imposed by Woods DCJ, the Applicant has 4 years in custody to cure his physical addiction, as an affidavit read on the usual limited basis, indicates he has done.  Commencing in July 2013 he has also participated in the Drug and Alcohol programs available in gaol.  There is no substance in this ground.
31I should add that in support of this ground Ms Burgess, appearing for the Applicant, sought to place weight on the fact that the Applicant had been released from almost 11 months custody in December 2010 without supervision.  No evidence was placed before the Court to indicate that the absence of parole and supervision at that time was against the wishes of the Applicant and given that he must have known of his drug problem it was well open to him in the period between that release and his 2012 offences to himself address his addiction.  There is no evidence that he made the slightest efforts in this regard.  Indeed the Pre-sentence Report indicates that the Applicant seems to have been perfectly content with almost daily use of ice, somewhat less frequent use of cocaine and tablets containing a mixture of ecstasy and acid and being part of a social network where using drugs was a shared activity. 
32I propose that the Applicant does have leave to appeal against sentence but that the appeal be dismissed.

2764185,Herbert v R [2014] NSWCCA 105,"Judgment

1GLEESON JA: I agree with Hamill J.

2BELLEW J: I agree with Hamill J.

3HAMILL J: On 10 May 2011 Douglas Charles Herbert (the appellant) was arraigned on a count that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting, and in circumstances of aggravation namely that, at the time of the offence, he recklessly occasioned actual bodily harm to the complainant. The offence was alleged to have occurred on 22 December 2008 at Wyong. The appellant pleaded ""not guilty due to the ground of mental illness"". A jury was empanelled and the appellant's trial proceeded over a two week period. On 23 May 2011 Judge Ellis commenced his summing up to the jury. The jury retired to consider its verdict at 1:10 pm the following day and at 11:38 am on 25 May 2011 the jury returned with a verdict of guilty.

4Proceedings on sentence took place on 25 May, 22 July, 4 November and 16 December of 2011. On 16 December 2011, the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 7 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. The non-parole period is to expire on 15 June 2015.

5A notice of application for leave to appeal and notice of appeal was filed on 9 October 2013. The grounds of appeal notified were as follows: 
(1)""His Honour was in error by not explaining the DNA report to the jury when introduced into evidence. The Crown introduce the DNA report poorly so the Jury could not have reached there verdict of beyond reasonable doubt due to the misinterpretation of the DNA evidence tendered by the Crown in evidence.
(2)The Jury were never supplied with all the evidence regarding the Medication that the Accused (Herbert) was on at the time of the alleged offence nor was it explored. If the Jury had this information the verdict of the Jury would not have been unreasonable.
(3)His Honour Judge Ellis was in error: The trial should not have continued when it was noted that the accused (Herbert) was extremely unwell and was on a mind altering drug (Xanax) to relieve his symptoms of Anxiety which lead to him having very little memory of the trial and proceedings. The accused (Herbert's) trial should have been aborted or a mistrial called as he was unable to give proper instruction to his Council during the course of the trial and defiantly not in the right state of mind to give evidence.
(4)His Honour Judge Ellis was in error: By not letting in all evidence regarding inconsistencies in statements regarding the Crown witness the Jury would have had a different view of the defence case during the trial and the Verdict of the Jury would not have been unreasonable and would have been supported by the evidence.
(5)The Verdict of the Jury would not have been unreasonable if the Police and Crown tendered all evidence and had all exhibits tested for DNA, all CCTV footage and all phone records.""

6At the hearing of the appeal the appellant confirmed that he made no complaint about the sentence imposed and he withdrew any suggestion in earlier documents that he sought to apply for leave to appeal against the sentence.

7The prosecution case was that the appellant met the complainant at a hotel on the Central Coast and each of them consumed alcohol. The appellant then offered the complainant a lift home which she accepted. Rather than taking her home, the appellant drove her to an area of bushland nearby and had penile vaginal sexual intercourse with her against her will. The complainant fought and struggled and in the course of the incident she sustained various injuries. After that incident the appellant drove the complainant back to the hotel.

8The Crown case was dependent upon the evidence of the complainant but her evidence received support in various forms. She had made an immediate complaint upon her return to the hotel. There was also medical evidence supporting the complainant's allegation that she had sustained injuries in the course of the attack. Evidence was given by a forensic biologist which established that semen was detected on a lower vaginal swab taken from the complainant. The DNA profile taken from the swab was consistent with the DNA profile of the appellant. There was also evidence from CCTV cameras within the hotel which confirmed the fact that the complainant and the appellant had been drinking together, had left together, and had returned together.

9The prosecution also relied on various things said by the appellant in the immediate aftermath of the incident. About two months after the incident in text messages to his family the appellant had said ""I think I did it"". In conversations with the police the appellant denied having sexual intercourse with the complainant and claimed that he found the complainant on his way home where he picked her up and returned her to the hotel at her request. The prosecution at trial relied on those statements to the police as lies told in consciousness of guilt and the appellant admitted in cross-examination at the trial that he had deliberately lied to the police. 

10The Crown called a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, and a neurologist, Dr Beran, to contest the defence case of mental illness. 

11The appellant's case was twofold. First, and in accordance with his plea on arraignment, he called evidence to establish that he was mentally ill at the time of the incident and therefore not criminally responsible for his actions. However, as the trial progressed, he also sought to raise a doubt about whether any sexual activity between himself and the complainant was without her consent. 

12The appellant gave evidence. Based on the evidence adduced in the Crown case, he accepted that he must have had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However he said that due to his mental state at the time he could not remember that event taking place. He relied on his good character, which was not contested by the prosecution. The evidence showed that apart from some minor and insignificant matters he had no criminal record. He said that it was not in his character to have sexual intercourse without consent. He agreed that he had told some deliberate lies to the police but said that those lies were not told because he knew that he was guilty but, rather, in order to protect his wife or more particularly to protect himself from the ramifications of his wife finding out about the allegations that he had had sex with the complainant.

13The appellant provided a history of epilepsy and other conditions which were said to support the claim of mental illness. A forensic psychiatrist Dr Michael Robert Guffrida gave evidence as to the appellant's mental health and the possible impact of various medications that the appellant claimed to have been taking at the time of the offence. 

14At his trial the appellant was represented by counsel. On this appeal he appeared unrepresented. There is no ground of appeal that alleges incompetence by trial counsel: cf R v Birks [1990] 19 NSWLR 677, Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9. At a call-over before the Registrar, the appellant was given the opportunity to amend his grounds of appeal by asserting incompetence of his trial counsel but he declined that offer on the grounds that such an amendment would result in a vacation of the date scheduled for the hearing of the appeal.

15However, at the beginning of his written submissions the appellant indicated that he had an issue with his trial counsel and had complained to the Legal Services Commissioner. The appellant submits: 
""I understand that the Appeal's Court cannot hear matters of this nature, however I may make mention to this poor representation not for the purpose of defence but to [show] how and why my trial was in trouble and issues that arise from that."" 

16On appeal, the respondent tendered evidence obtained from the Legal Services Commissioner. This included the appellant's complaint, defence counsel's response and the decision made by the Legal Services Commissioner. The complaint has been dismissed. However, the appellant informed the Court that he intends to appeal against the dismissal. Counsel for the respondent, who conducted the appeal responsibly and with restraint, fairly conceded that the conclusions of the Legal Services Commissioner should not be taken into account in considering the conduct of trial counsel. However she stressed that the appellant declined the opportunity to press a specific ground about counsel's conduct and notes that counsel has not had the opportunity to respond to the complaint. She says that the material tendered is relevant to show defence counsel's response to the appellant's allegations in circumstances where trial counsel has not had the opportunity to be heard in this Court.

17As will be seen when ground (3) is analysed, there is substance in the assertion that the appellant's barrister at trial made a significant error in the conduct of the proceedings. However, it is important to remember that there is no specific ground asserting the kind of ""flagrant incompetence"" that has sometimes led to appellate court's finding that trial proceedings had miscarried due to the conduct of the case by trial counsel: cf R v Ensor [1989] 1 WLR 497 at 502; [1989] 2 All ER 586 at 590; R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. 

18I turn now to consider the grounds of appeal that are relied upon by the appellant.

Appeal Ground (1)
""(1) His Honour was in error by not explaining the DNA report to the jury when introduced into evidence. The Crown introduce the DNA report poorly so the Jury could not have reached there verdict of beyond reasonable doubt due to the misinterpretation of the DNA evidence tendered by the Crown in evidence.""

19By this ground of appeal the appellant contends that the DNA evidence, which was led by the Crown without objection, was wrongly admitted into evidence, was not subject to sufficient explanation to enable the jury to understand it and/or was presented in an unfair and incomplete manner.

20The appellant complains that whilst samples were taken from various other places, the only evidence led was the evidence that the appellant's DNA, probably from his semen, was located on the lower vaginal swab taken from the complainant. The appellant refers to statements made by the complainant which suggested that his semen may have been present at other locations. For example, the complainant told a barman that she had ""cum dripping down my leg"". 

21None of this provides any basis upon which it could be said that the evidence was inadmissible. The evidence was plainly relevant. It provided cogent support for the complainant's allegation that sexual intercourse, including ejaculation, had occurred. In view of the appellant's denial to the police that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with the complainant and his case at trial that he could not remember that event, it was important for the jury to hear evidence which provided support for the complainant's allegation that sexual intercourse had occurred between them.

22The evidence was correctly admitted.

23As to the complaint that the evidence was not sufficiently explained to the jury, the prosecution called Dr Wedervang, the forensic biologist who had provided the DNA report. She explained relevant terminology and the nature of the science. It is true that that evidence was relatively brief. She was not cross-examined. Stripped of the science behind DNA evidence, the evidence was straightforward and needed little explanation. The evidence was not contested and there is no suggestion that it could have been contested. The evidence established that on examination by a medical practitioner, swabs were taken from the complainant's vagina. Smears from the swabs were tested and showed the presence of semen. The appellant provided police with buccal swabs and a comparison between the DNA profile of the vaginal wall swabs could be made with the DNA profile of the appellant. That comparison showed to a very high degree of certainty that the appellant's DNA was present on the lower vaginal swab taken from the complainant. Very little further explanation was required. 

24The appellant's complaint that the DNA evidence was incomplete requires closer examination. The appellant's complaint was well articulated on the hearing of the appeal. It was also contained in his written submissions. He says that the DNA examination suggested or established that there was a third contributor to the DNA mixture found on the swabs taken from the complainant. He asserts that this third contributor was effectively hidden from the jury. The third contributor was a male. The transcript confirms that the crown prosecutor cut off Dr Wedervang when she said that ""traces of DNA from a third individual were also ..."". 

25At the hearing of the appeal the appellant asserted that he now had information to suggest that the existence of a third contributor to the DNA mixture showed that the complainant must have had sexual relations with another man after the sexual relations which formed the basis of the charge against him. According to the appellant, this undermined the suggestion that the complainant did not consent to sexual intercourse with him.

26The information to which the appellant was referring was information provided to him by a biologist, who he had met whilst in prison. Apart from the appellant's assertions in relation to the inference to be drawn from the existence of a third contributor, there is no evidence to support a conclusion that the third contributor had sexual relations with the complainant at any particular time. There is certainly no evidence to support the proposition that the complainant had sexual intercourse with anybody after the incident involving the accused and before she was seen by the doctor.

27On one view, the evidence of the third contributor was not relevant to the questions to be determined by the jury. But even if the evidence was relevant in some way it was likely to be excluded as a result of the correct application of s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). That section is in the following terms: 

Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience
(1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence.
(2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible.
(3) Evidence that discloses or implies:
(a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or
(b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity, is inadmissible.
(4) Subsection (3) does not apply:
(a) if the evidence:
(i) is of the complainant's sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and
(ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed,
(b) if the evidence relates to a relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant,
(c) if:
(i) the accused person is alleged to have had sexual intercourse (as defined in section 61H (1) of the Crimes Act 1900) with the complainant, and the accused person does not concede the sexual intercourse so alleged, and
(ii) the evidence is relevant to whether the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease or injury is attributable to the sexual intercourse alleged to have been had by the accused person,
(d) if the evidence is relevant to:
(i) whether at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence there was present in the complainant a disease that, at any relevant time, was absent in the accused person, or
(ii) whether at any relevant time there was absent in the complainant a disease that, at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, was present in the accused person,
(e) if the evidence is relevant to whether the allegation that the prescribed sexual offence was committed by the accused person was first made following a realisation or discovery of the presence of pregnancy or disease in the complainant (being a realisation or discovery that took place after the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence),
(f) if the evidence has been given by the complainant in cross-examination by or on behalf of the accused person, being evidence given in answer to a question that may, pursuant to subsection (6), be asked,
and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission.
(5) A witness must not be asked:
(a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or
(b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible.
(6) If the court is satisfied:
(a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period:
(i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or
(ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and
(b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication, the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified.
(7) On the trial of a person, any question as to the admissibility of evidence under subsection (2) or (3) or the right to cross-examine under subsection (6) is to be decided by the court in the absence of the jury.
(8) If the court decides that evidence is admissible under subsection (4), the court must, before the evidence is given, record or cause to be recorded in writing the nature and scope of the evidence that is so admissible and the reasons for that decision.

28Evidence of a third DNA contributor was likely to disclose or imply that the complainant may have had a sexual experience other than that charged against the appellant. Section 293(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act was engaged. Unless the evidence was caught by the exceptions in sub-ss (4) or (6), it was not admissible. 

29The evidence did not naturally fit into any of the exceptions under sub-s (4) and sub-s (6) had no application. It may have been possible to argue that sub-paragraph (4)(a) had some application, however, there was no evidence to establish that the sexual experience occurred ""at or about the time"" of the alleged sexual offence and no evidence that any such experience was part of ""a connected set of circumstances"" in which the offence was allegedly committed. There was no other applicable exception to the exclusionary rule. 

30In the circumstances it is not surprising that the material was excluded from the trial. It was not admissible. 

31For the reasons I have articulated ground (1) must be rejected. 



Appeal Ground (2)

""(2) The Jury were never supplied with all the evidence regarding the Medication that the Accused (Herbert) was on at the time of the alleged offence nor was it explored. If the Jury had this information the verdict of the Jury would not have been unreasonable.""

32In his written submissions the appellant recast this ground to some degree but the effect of the argument is the same. The contention is that the jury was not provided with all or sufficient information regarding the medications or drugs that the appellant was taking at the time of the offence. The appellant was taking a combination of drugs which he says affected his mental capacity, making it difficult to prove the necessary intention. The evidence may also have been relevant to the jury's assessment of the credibility of the appellant's assertion that he could not remember the one hour or so when he was with the complainant. Without such an explanation, the jury may have taken the view that the appellant's account was incredible.

33There is no substance to this ground of appeal. The appellant had provided a history to Dr Guiffrida in which he had explained the medication or medications that he was on at the time. Dr Guiffrida gave evidence and part of that evidence was an exploration of the impact of those drugs on the appellant's mental state at the time. Dr Nielssen, who was called by the Crown on the issue of mental illness, was also examined in relation to these matters. In his evidence in chief, the appellant was asked a number of questions directed both to his medical history and the medications which he had been prescribed in the course of his life. He was also asked about the medications that he had consumed at around the time of the offence and he gave evidence both as to the drugs that he had taken and the impact that those drugs had upon him. His wife also gave evidence as to those matters. 

34The case was plainly prepared on the basis that both his psychiatric condition and the medications he took were live issues in the trial. The method in which his evidence in chief was adduced, which gave significant focus to those matters, and the retaining of expert psychiatrists to give evidence as to those matters shows that counsel's focus was on the issue.

35The appellant's submissions include extensive reference to the impact of various drugs when taken in combination. He provided the Court with information from 'MIMS' as to the impact of Lovan and Xanax. The appellant contends in the light of his own experiences and the scientific research that he has undertaken, some of these medications - in particular the drug Xanax - are dangerous and pernicious substances. He asserts in his ground of appeal that the jury would not have convicted him ""unreasonably"" if they had been fully apprised of the impact that such drugs may have had on him at the time of the alleged offence.

36Insofar as this ground attempts to adduce new evidence as to these matters I would reject the tender of such material. As I have said it is clear that the preparation of the appellant's trial focused to a very significant degree on the very issue that the appellant now seeks to ventilate. Further, the conduct of the trial from beginning to end brought into focus the matters to which reference is now made.

37Nothing that the appellant now says on this issue would have made any difference to the jury's assessment of the case. The evidence that was adduced at trial clearly brought home to them the issue that was raised. The jury had the benefit of expert opinion from both Dr Nielssen and Dr Guiffrida, the evidence of the appellant and his wife as well as the evidence of his behaviour in and around the time of the alleged offending. The jury was in a position to make an assessment, one way or the other, as to whether those matters impacted upon the credibility of the appellant and his capacity to form the requisite intention and the issues of voluntariness and mental illness.

38I reject ground (2). 

Appeal Ground (3)
""(3) His Honour Judge Ellis was in error: The trial should not have continued when it was noted that the accused (Herbert) was extremely unwell and was on a mind altering drug (Xanax) to relieve his symptoms of Anxiety which lead to him having very little memory of the trial and proceedings. The accused (Herbert's) trial should have been aborted or a mistrial called, as he was unable to give proper instruction to his Council during the course of the trial and defiantly not in the right state of mind to give evidence.""

39This ground was argued in the written submissions somewhat differently to the precise ground that was raised in the Notice of Appeal. In view of the fact that he is unrepresented in this appeal it is necessary for the Court to approach such a technicality with a degree of flexibility. The appellant contends by ground (3) that the trial judge fell into error in a number of specific respects. He particularised five errors (a)-(e) and, with the exception of (b), which requires closer examination, I will deal with them in the order that they were articulated in the written submissions.

40The first error (a) was that the trial judge fell into error by becoming ""the third [counsel]"" by questioning a number of witnesses in a manner that demonstrated bias because the questioning tended to assist the prosecution.

41The first answer to this assertion is that no complaint was made at trial in circumstances where a thorough review of the record of proceedings shows that defence counsel was more than happy to engage in debate with both her opponent and the trial judge. This means that any complaint now made must be made with the leave of the court under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW). If there is substance to the complaint that the trial judge demonstrated bias in his conduct of the proceedings I would certainly grant such leave.

42However, having reviewed the transcript closely, I am unable to discern that Judge Ellis at any stage disclosed bias towards the appellant. It is true that he asked a number of questions in the course of the evidence. However, that questioning was not repetitive or tendentious. It is also true that he intervened in defence counsel's examination of the complainant on more than one occasion but those interventions were justified in the circumstances. On one occasion his Honour questioned counsel as to the purpose of the cross-examination and why the complainant was being interrogated at length in relation to fine and peripheral detail. However, his Honour asked the jury to leave the court room while he made those inquiries so that his intervention did not to prejudice the appellant's right to a fair trial. In some respects this was helpful to the appellant in that it encouraged counsel to focus on issues that may actually make a difference rather than on peripheral details which the jury was unlikely to find helpful.

43Other interventions were calculated to clarify issues that may have been confusing to the jury.

44The case is far removed from the kinds of cases where a trial judges intervention has caused the proceedings to miscarry: R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 345, R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442, R v Murray; R v Bates (District Court (NSW), Hunt CJ at CL, Smart and Grove JJ, 6 April 1992), R v Mawson (Supreme Court (NSW), Winneke CJ, Adam and Barber JJ, 11 November 1966), R v Stranger (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Gleeson CJ, Smart and Grove JJ, 28 June 1989). I can see no substance to ground (3)(a). 

45I will return to ground 3(b).

46The appellant complains in ground (3)(c) that the trial judge fell into error by not allowing evidence that police had withheld evidence of ""missing CCTV footage"" and ""missing telephone records"". This part of ground (3) relates closely to ground (5).

47Evidence tendered by the respondent on appeal establishes that there was significant disclosure in advance of the trial and that no evidence was withheld. The CCTV footage and statements of employees of the relevant telephone companies were served while the matter was in the Local Court. 

48What happened at the trial is that the parties agreed that rather than tendering vast pages of telephone records it would provide a chart of relevant telephone calls. While the appellant now contends that there were other relevant telephone calls made, I can see no basis for this in the material. The approach taken at trial was a sensible one and allowed the jury to focus on the telephone calls that were relevant.

49As to the CCTV footage the appellant seems to believe that there was potentially other footage available - particularly footage from outside the hotel - which would have created some doubt as to the issue of consent.

50It appears that all of this evidence was disclosed to the defence before the hearing although it is unclear whether every camera available either worked or was produced. Nevertheless, the CCTV footage that was available provided ample evidence on which the jury could make assessments as to the behaviour of both the appellant and the complainant. This included evidence favourable to the appellant in that plainly he and the complainant were getting on well at the hotel before they left and also that they left the hotel together. 

51Defence counsel used the CCTV footage to good effect in challenging the memory of some of the witnesses. That evidence may have assisted the defence in attempting to persuade the jury that there was a reasonable doubt as to the question of consent but, plainly enough, the jury was not so persuaded. 

52The trial judge made no error in relation to issues of non-disclosure. 

53The next error alleged to have been made by Judge Ellis concerned his Honour allowing the trial to continue even though he knew ""full well that the appellant was under the influence of the mind altering drug Xanax"". The appellant contends that he had an ""anxiety attack"" on 18 May 2011, and that he then took Xanax on the advice of Dr Guiffrida who was present and waiting to give evidence. In oral argument the appellant explained that he had a terrible addiction to Xanax earlier in his life, an addiction that he had fought and conquered. When he took Xanax in the course of the trial, he experienced a relapse.

54He says that from that point he was unable properly to involve himself in the trial, was unable to instruct his counsel as to important matters and (I infer) was at a disadvantage when he returned to the witness box on 20 May 2011. The record of the proceedings shows that the appellant commenced to give evidence on 18 May 2011. As I understand the complaint now made, the anxiety attack which prompted the appellant to take the Xanax occurred on that day although it is not completely clear to me at what time of the day this occurred. In any event when the trial came to resume on 19 May 2011 the first thing that happened was that counsel then appearing for the appellant raised the issue with the trial judge. She informed the trial judge that the appellant was having breathing problems. Counsel attempted to have the complainant's family removed from the court while she made the application but the trial judge insisted that she articulate the problem in open court. The appellant's counsel went on to explain in some detail the difficulties that the appellant was experience experiencing. For example she said:
""[A]s your Honour knows Mr Herbert has a long history of collapses, whatever the underlying causes are he has ended up in hospital and is unconscious over a number of years, some 30 years or so. He has been maintaining control while in these proceedings although at times it has been precarious. He has become increasingly unwell last couple of days. His wife told me last night that he was - he had a significant tremors and was disorientated. He hasn't eaten or slept it would seem for a couple of days..."". 

55Counsel told the trial judge that she herself had witnessed the appellant becoming unwell in court and that she had rushed him out of court as a result. She told the judge of the observations of various friends of the appellant and of the intervention of medical practitioners. After explaining this counsel for the appellant said: 
""[H]e wishes the matter to proceed, family members have gone home to get medication for him, in fact Xanax because he hasn't been taking it, but that's to relieve anxiety and that was at Dr Guiffrida's recommendation.""

56Part of the complaint appeared to be that one of the witnesses associated with the complainant had ""followed"" the appellant and trial counsel, and the trial judge became involved in a debate about whether their observations were the same. However that seemed to be a peripheral issue to the one that counsel was raising. As a result of that issue, the trial judge directed one of the witnesses to avoid any circumstance that might result in the appellant having a perception of being followed. That was an unusual thing for his Honour to do and plainly based on an acceptance of the perception that both the appellant and his lawyers had.

57The result of the discussion was that the appellant was excused from the witness box and Dr Guiffrida was interposed in order to allow the trial to continue. By that stage the trial had proceeded well beyond the estimate that had been given as to its length. At the conclusion of the psychiatrist's evidence, the case was adjourned until 20 May 2011. 

58When the case resumed the accused returned to the witness box. There is nothing in the transcript of his evidence on 20 May, particularly when compared to the transcript of his evidence on 18 May, to suggest that the appellant had any greater difficulty in giving evidence on that day. Further, there was no application to vacate the trial or to abort the trial or to further adjourn the proceedings. It can only be assumed that counsel then appearing was of the view that the appellant was capable of continuing to give evidence and capable of continuing to instruct her insofar as such instructions were necessary at such a late stage of the proceedings.

59The written submissions under ground (3)(e) indicate that the appellant alleges that Judge Ellis fell into error in the sentencing hearing by not taking into account the decision of this court in R v Hopkins [2004] NSWCCA 105. However at the hearing of the appeal, the appellant indicated that he did not pursue an appeal against sentence.

60Ground (3)(b) raises a matter of some concern. While the complaint is one directed to the conduct of Judge Ellis, the real problem concerns the conduct of trial counsel. The complaint, on its terms, is that Judge Ellis erred in allowing inadmissible evidence to be introduced into the trial in circumstances where the prosecution had agreed that it would not lead that evidence. The ground expressed in those terms is misconceived. It was not Judge Ellis, but the appellant's barrister, who introduced the evidence into the trial. The circumstances in which that occurred are quite extraordinary.

61The evidence in question concerned part of the conversation that the appellant had with police officers a short time after the alleged assault. The police alleged that the appellant had said words to the effect that he had ejaculate (""cum"") on his shirt and that this ejaculate was the result of him attending a brothel that night. That conversation was not recorded by electronic means. It was a conversation made at the scene of the appellant's arrest. Later that morning the appellant took part in an electronically recorded interview with police. In the course of that interview, police attempted to have the appellant adopt the earlier conversation, including the part of the conversation concerning the appellant having ""cum on his shirt"" and having been to a brothel. The appellant neither adopted nor confirmed that the conversation had taken place. On the other hand, he did not deny it. Rather, he indicated that ""I will refrain from going any further on that one"" and ""No, I will not go into that conversation"". The result of this was that the police asserted a conversation which was neither recorded nor adopted by the appellant.

62In those circumstances the appellant's counsel indicated to the prosecutor that she objected to those statements. The statements were potentially very damaging to the defence and capable of being used by the jury in two related ways. There was evidence to establish that the assertion that the appellant had been to a brothel was false. The Crown would have contended that the statement was a deliberate lie told in consciousness of guilt. Further, the Crown would have contended that the appellant's reference to ""cum on his shirt"" was an attempt to justify the presence of semen in circumstances where, in other statements to the police, he denied having sex with the complainant. I interpolate here that the appellant adopted the denial of sexual intercourse and at the trial he admitted that this denial was a deliberate lie. He claimed at the trial that ""I didn't know, but I didn't want to put myself in a position where I had to go home and explain to my wife I'd been charged with this"". He agreed with the proposition that he had ""made a deliberate decision to give these detailed lies to the police"".

63Returning to his statements concerning the ejaculate on his shirt and the visit to the brothel, the objection taken by counsel was based around s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act which provides:
Admissions by suspects
(1) This section applies to an admission:
(a) that was made by an accused person who, at the time when the admission was made, was or could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence, and
(b) that was made in the course of official questioning, and
(c) that relates to an indictable offence, other than an indictable offence that can be dealt with summarily without the consent of the accused person.

(2) Evidence of an admission to which this section applies is not admissible unless:
(a) there is available to the court:
(i) a tape recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the admission was made, or
(ii) if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in subparagraph (i) could not be made, a tape recording of an interview with the person who made the admission, being an interview about the making and terms of the admission in the course of which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or

(b) the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could not be made.

(3) The hearsay rule and the opinion rule (within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995 ) do not prevent a tape recording from being admitted and used in proceedings before the court as mentioned in subsection (2).

(4) In this section: 

""investigating official"" means:
(a) a police officer (other than a police officer who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior), or
(b) a person appointed by or under an Act (other than a person who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior) whose functions include functions in respect of the prevention or investigation of offences prescribed by the regulations.

""official questioning"" means questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence. 

""reasonable excuse"" includes:
(a) a mechanical failure, or
(b) the refusal of a person being questioned to have the questioning electronically recorded, or
(c) the lack of availability of recording equipment within a period in which it would be reasonable to detain the person being questioned.

""tape recording"" includes:
(a) audio recording, or
(b) video recording, or
(c) a video recording accompanied by a separately but contemporaneously recorded audio recording.

64The prosecutor at trial took what the trial judge described to be a ""generous"" approach. The prosecutor elected to accede to the defence objection and undertook not to adduce the evidence. Accordingly, when the relevant police officers were in the witness box no evidence was led to them regarding the part of the conversation where the appellant told them that the ""cum on his shirt"" was the result of an earlier visit to a brothel. Similarly, the electronically recorded interview (which became exhibit N) was edited so that the attempts by the police to have the appellant adopt those statements in the recorded interview were deleted.

65The situation at the close of the prosecution case was that no evidence had been adduced in support of the contention that the appellant had said those things to police. As noted this was the result of the prosecutor accepting the defence submission that the evidence was inadmissible as a result of the operation of s 281of the Criminal Procedure Act. To that point of the trial, Judge Ellis had not been called upon to make any ruling as to this matter because the parties had agreed that the evidence would not be admitted. 

66It is in those circumstances the following extract from the appellant's evidence in chief is remarkable:

Q. Do you have a recollection of officers arriving, the first officers who arrived, to speak to you? A. Yes, female constable. I remember her.

Q. Do you recollect a conversation you had with her? A. Not fully, no but we did have a conversation, I know that.

Q, You've seen the record of interview where you were asked to adopt comments that you made to the officer? 
A. That's correct, yes.

Q. You have seen that a number of times? 
A. Yeah.

Q. You have read it a number of times? 
A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember telling the officer that you had been at a brothel? 
A. No I don't.

Q. Remember seeing that footage?
A. Yes.

Q. Had you been at a brothel? 
A. No.

Q. Are you able to explain why you said that? 
A. No.

Q. Do you remember saying to the officer that you had some cum on your shirt?
A. No.


67It can be seen that the impugned statements were led by defence counsel who had not only taken the original objection, at least in conversations with the Crown, but had also been present in court when the police officers gave evidence and when the electronically recorded interview was played to the jury in its edited form. 

68When the jury retired after that part of the examination the Crown prosecutor raised the matter with the trial judge. The trial judge said to defence counsel:
""I don't know why you did that. I hadn't heard that before."" 

69Defence counsel asserted that the evidence was ""in"". The trial Judge said ""No it wasn't in"", and the prosecutor confirmed:
""It wasn't in. You objected to it. It was taken out of the ERISP. That was the edit that was required to the ERISP and it was also taken out of the statement of Detective Gillies when it was read.""

Defence counsel maintained that ""it's in here. It's in the ERISP"".

70In due course, defence counsel was persuaded that the evidence had been excised in accordance with her request. However, she ""thought that part remained in"". She said that she had ""obviously made a mistake"" because she ""didn't think those words were taken out"". She acknowledged that it was ""my fault"" and that ""it is clearly a stuff up on my part your Honour"".

71The Crown indicated that she wished to cross-examine the accused on the issue and to lead evidence from the police officers to prove that the words had been said by the appellant. It is significant, in light of the assertion that the trial judge fell into error by admitting the evidence, that his Honour said this: 
""Yes well I am more concerned now about sheeting home to your client your mistake effectively.""

72The conduct of defence counsel placed the trial judge in an invidious position. His Honour was plainly troubled by what had occurred and saw the unfairness in the accused person being disadvantaged because of the lack of focus and rigour of his barrister. On the other hand the material had been introduced before the jury in circumstances where the prosecutor had taken a reasonable and reasoned position and where the evidence if accepted was plainly relevant evidence.

73Following further discussions and consideration, the prosecutor was permitted to cross-examine about the matter. The appellant admitted (or could not deny) that the words had been said. He also acknowledged that he had told other lies to the police. The relevant part of the cross-examination is as follows:
Q. Do you agree that you never once said to Senior Constable Murray, ""I have no memory of what happened when I was away from this hotel""?
A. I've been caught out in a lie, I was worried about what my wife was going to say. We were going to, as I said, we were going through a hard time, right, and I did, I invented it, I made it up, right, because I couldn't remember what took place.

Q. Well, why not just say, ""I have no memory"". That wasn't going to implicate you in an offence was it? 
A. At the time I didn't believe I'd done anything wrong.

Q. Well at the time, what did you believe you'd done? 
A. Well it was already, while Constable Murray was there, the other constable was there, right and he was throwing questions at me left, right and centre. That hasn't gone in the ..(not transcribable).. books.

Q. What you told her, she asked you specifically this question. ""Was there any sexual contact with the complainant?"" 
A. Yes.

Q. And you said, ""no""?
A. Yes.

Q. That was a lie? 
A. Yes.

Q. And you say it was a deliberate lie to protect your wife? 
A. Correct.

Q. Is that right? 
A. Correct.

Q. Because you knew didn't you, that there had been sexual contact between you and the complainant? 
A. I didn't know, but I didn't want to put myself in a position where I had to go home and explain to my wife I'd been charged with this, at that point in time I was only just being, it was just a, a few questions asked me around about the incident.

Q. So you say you made a deliberate decision to give these detailed lies to police?
A. At the time yes.

Q. And when Detective Chad Gillies arrives, this is about 12.20 am. So you'd been back in-the hotel about two hours and 20 minutes at this point in time. You told him didn't you that you had nothing to hide? 
A. Well, yes.

Q. Well that was a lie wasn't it?
A. Well the lie I'd told, yes, was a lie on a lie.

Q. So now, when Detective Chad Gillies arrives, you again made the deliberate decision to continue lying, is that the position? 
A. I didn't want to get caught out.

Q. And he told you that the police would be taking your clothing for a forensic examination didn't he? 
A. I believe so yes.

Q. And you said to him, ""You're not getting them, I'll get my lawyer here""? 
A. Well that's what I wanted to do.

Q. So you then said to him, ""Your forensic evidence has been contaminated, if you're worried about the come on my shirt, it's here. I was at a brothel tonight""?
A. That's in the statements, yes, so I have to agree with it.

Q. And Detective Gillies said to you, ""You said you were at a brothel"" and you replied, ""I fucked my guts out at a brothel, is that okay, I'll have come on my shirt."" That's what you said to police wasn't it? 
A. It's in the statement, I can't argue.

Q. And what you're indicating to police was, they may find semen on your shirt, but it was nothing to do with a sexual encounter with the complainant, it was because earlier on in the night, you'd been at a brothel, that's what you were telling them? 
A. Well that's more than likely what I alluded to, yes.

Q. You now tell the court that you never had been to a brothel that night, had you, that was a lie? 
A. Yes.

Q. But you knew that there was semen on your shirt? 
A. Well, I didn't, but I was using it as a way out.

Q. You were trying to explain away why there would be semen on your shirt, weren't you, innocently is that right? 
A. Yes.

Q. The only way you could have known there was semen on your shirt, was because you remembered a sexual encounter with [the complainant] that's right isn't it? 
A. No.


74In so far as this ground of appeal asserts error on the part of the trial judge, it must be rejected. The trial judge made no error and was plainly concerned to exercise his functions in such a way that the appellant was no more prejudiced in the conduct of his defence. Once the evidence had been introduced by defence counsel, the prosecutor's application to cross-examine on the issue could not properly be refused. Indeed, the prosecutor was under no obligation to raise the matter in advance once it had been raised in evidence in chief. 

75However, because the appellant is unrepresented on the hearing of the appeal I have considered the question in a more global way. In particular, I have considered the question of whether or not the conduct of the appellant's counsel caused the proceedings to miscarry. I am in little doubt that the conduct of the appellant's counsel might be described as ""flagrantly incompetent"". This is the kind of description that has been used in some of the cases where miscarriages of justice have been said to arise from the conduct of defence counsel at trial. In effect, it constitutes an exception to the rule that litigants are bound by the conduct of their lawyers. 

76In R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 Gleeson CJ said at [685]:
""The relevant principles, may be summarised as follows:
1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates.
2 . As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ""flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.""

77The ultimate question is not one that is focused on the conduct of the lawyer but on whether there has been a ""miscarriage of justice"". This point was emphasised in a trilogy of cases in the High Court: TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [30] per Gaudron J and at [74]-[76] per McHugh J, Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; (2005) 79 ALJR 662; 214 ALR 1; Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9.

78In TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 Gaudron J said (at [31]):
""As in the case where there is a defect or irregularity in the trial, the reason why something occurred or did not occur is relevant to the question whether, in the circumstances, there was a miscarriage of justice. But the relevant question that must ultimately be answered, is whether the act or omission resulted in a miscarriage of justice, not whether, if it is referable to the course taken by defence counsel, it was the result of 'flagrant incompetence', 'egregious error' or the like.""

79The matter was discussed by McHugh J (at [74]-[85]). His Honour said (at [79]):
""The critical issue in an appeal like the present is not whether counsel erred in some way but whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. However, 'whether counsel has been negligent or otherwise remiss ... remains relevant as an intermediate or subsidiary issue'. That is because the issue of miscarriage of justice in such cases ordinarily subsumes two issues. First, did counsel's conduct result in a material irregularity in the trial? Second, is there a significant possibility that the irregularity affected the outcome? Whether a material irregularity occurred must be considered in light of the wide discretion that counsel has to conduct the trial as he or she thinks best and the fact that ordinarily the client is bound by the decisions of counsel. Accordingly, ""it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence"". The appellant must show that the failing or error of counsel was a material irregularity and that there is a significant possibility that it affected the outcome of the trial.""

80Gleeson CJ put it simply in Nudd v The Queen (at [2]), a case decided under the Queensland equivalent of s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act: 
""The jurisdiction invoked was that conferred by s 668E of the Criminal Code (Q), which is in a form similar to the statutory provisions governing criminal appeals in the other Australian States and Territories. The statutory ground of appeal was that there was a miscarriage of justice. That, as was said in R v Birks, Ignjatic, TKWJ v The Queen, and Ali v The Queen, defined the issue to be decided. The appellant's criticisms of the conduct of his trial counsel were relevant to the issue, but the issue was whether there was a miscarriage of justice.""

81In the same case Gummow and Hayne JJ said (at [24]):
""As four members of this Court explained in TKWJ v The Queen, describing trial counsel's conduct of a trial as ""incompetent"" (with or without some emphatic term like ""flagrantly"") must not be permitted to distract attention from the question presented by the relevant criminal appeal statute, here s 668E of the Criminal Code (Q). ""Miscarriage of justice"", as a ground on which a court of appeal is required by the common form of criminal appeal statute to allow an appeal against conviction, may encompass any of a very wide variety of departures from the proper conduct of a trial. Alleging that trial counsel was incompetent does not reveal what is said to be the miscarriage of justice. That requires consideration of what did or did not occur at the trial, of whether there was a material irregularity in the trial, and whether there was a significant possibility that the acts or omissions of which complaint is made affected the outcome of the trial."" 

82It will be seen that the exercise is not designed to attribute blame but rather to determine whether the conduct of counsel can properly be said to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 

83I am not certain that the evidence was inadmissible under s 281. Had that question been explored at the trial it may have been open to the trial judge to find that there was a ""reasonable excuse as to why a tape-recording had not been made"".

84It is impossible for this Court to come to any considered conclusion as to the applicability of s 281. However, the Court can consider the context in which this evidence was adduced and whether the incompetence of defence counsel caused a miscarriage of justice. In this context it is important to remember that the evidence was used in order to establish a consciousness of guilt in the appellant. As was pointed out by counsel for the respondent in this Court there was ample evidence upon which the jury might have concluded that the actions of the appellant in the period after the alleged offence demonstrated a consciousness of guilt. 

85In particular, and without setting out all of the evidence, the following was capable of establishing a consciousness of guilt:
(1)At about 11.45pm on 22 December 2008 the appellant told Senior Constable Murray that he did not have any sexual contact with the complainant.
(2)He told SC Murray that he found the complainant ""at Apex Park, face down, comatose"".
(3)At around 4:00 am in a recorded interview he again asserted that he found the complainant in a gutter. 
(4)In the same interview he claimed that he was sweating when he returned to the hotel because of the effects of medication (Lovan) but that this had worn off by the time the police arrived. 
(5)He also said that he had never had consensual sex with the complainant. 
(6)On 6 March 2009 he sent a text message to members of his family which stated ""I think I did it. I'm remember flashbacks.""
(7)On the same day he threatened or implied that he may attempt to commit suicide and was found in bushland with rope around his neck. 
(8)When police approached him on that occasion he again said that he had found the complainant in a gutter and helped her by driving her back to the hotel at her request. 
(9)He gave evidence at the trial that he had no memory of the events at all.
(10)He agreed in his evidence that he had told deliberate lies to the police and had not asserted to the police that he had no memory of the events. 

86The jury was entitled to use the evidence of lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt. It received appropriate directions as to the matter. The appellant provided an explanation for telling the lies, namely that he was trying to avoid conflict with his wife, but the jury was entitled to reject that explanation.

87The existence of this other material going to the consciousness of guilt persuades me that the incompetent introduction of the evidence that he lied about going to a brothel to justify the ""cum on his shirt"" did not affect the result of the trial and did not lead to a miscarriage of justice. 

88As I have already said the ground of appeal which asserts error on the part of the trial Judge cannot be sustained. Further, the appellant elected not to prosecute a ground of appeal relying on counsel's incompetence. Even so I should record that if he had raised such a ground I would have rejected the ground on the basis that the clearly egregious error made by the barrister did not lead to a miscarriage of justice. 

Appeal Ground 4
""(4) His Honour Judge Ellis was in error: By not letting in all evidence regarding inconsistencies in statements regarding the Crown witness the Jury would have had a different view of the defence case during the trial and the Verdict of the Jury would not have been unreasonable and would have been supported by the evidence.""

89Contrary to the thrust of the submissions made under this ground, the trial judge allowed defence counsel to explore inconsistencies said to arise in the complainant's version of events and in the prosecution case generally.

90As the respondent submits, the appellant has not identified precisely what ruling the trial judge made which is said to be erroneous. As the respondent also submits, if the complaint is that the sentencing judge at one stage intervened during the cross examination of the complainant, that intervention was in the circumstances both restrained and appropriate. His Honour also assured counsel ""you can ask whatever you like, whatever forensic decision you make is a matter for you"".

91Most, if not all, of the individual items of evidence referred to in the appellant's submissions were before the jury. This includes the CCTV footage and summaries of the records of telephone calls. The jury was entitled to draw inferences from that material as to whether it supported the prosecution case or whether it was inconsistent with it (as the appellant now contends).

92I would reject ground (4). I can identify no error made by the trial judge and the exploration of matters of detail and inconsistency was adequate to enable the jury to form the necessary factual conclusions that it was called upon to form in determining the issues between the parties. It is not without significance that whatever attack the defence counsel made was made without the benefit of any instructions from the appellant in circumstances where the appellant claimed to have no memory of the relevant one hour period.

Appeal Ground (5)
""(5) The Verdict of the Jury would not have been unreasonable if the Police and Crown tendered all evidence and had all exhibits tested for DNA, all CCTV footage and all phone records.""

93I have already dealt with the substance of this ground in considering ground 3(a). That ground was directed to the conduct of the trial Judge. The present ground is a more general assertion that there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of non-disclosure by the police and prosecuting authority. It falls to be considered by reference to principles considered by the High Court in the case of Grey v The Queen [2001] HCA 65; (2001) 184 ALR 593; (2001) 75 ALJR 1708.

94In Grey v The Queen there was no issue as to non-disclosure. The prosecution conceded that it had not disclosed material relevant to the credibility of a central witness. The decision revolved around significance of that material. In this case, the Crown disputes that it failed to disclose any relevant material. 

95On the hearing of the appeal, the Crown read an affidavit which was annexed to various documents by which the evidence had been served in advance of the committal hearing. The affidavit also addressed the specific records that the appellant submitted had not been disclosed. 

96This material satisfies me that all relevant evidence was disclosed to the appellant's previous solicitors. 

97This ground must also be rejected. 

The Proviso

98I should also record, for the sake of completeness, that even if one of the grounds of appeal were established I would have applied the proviso in s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. I am satisfied that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. 

99I have reviewed the transcript and the exhibits. The case presented by the prosecution was extremely strong. To adopt the kind of language employed by the High Court when considering the application of the proviso, I am of the opinion that conviction was inevitable and that the jury could take no other approach to the evidence. In addition to the evidence given by the complainant, which itself was extremely strong, there was also evidence establishing, or capable of establishing:
The movements of the appellant before and after the incident. This included evidence from patrons of the hotel as well as the CCTV footage. 
That sexual intercourse took place. This was DNA evidence.
Almost immediate complaints of ""rape"" which were, generally and in important respects, consistent with the version that the complainant gave to the jury. This included a description of the location of the incident (in the bush near a water tank) almost immediately after the event. 
That the complainant exhibited signs of extreme distress shortly after the event. 
That she was also 'dishevelled' and her hair was roughed up. This evidence came from patrons of the hotel as well as members of her family. 
That the complainant and the appellant had grass and/or dirt on their clothing consistent with the complainant's account of a sexual account in bushland.
Injuries that the jury was entitled to consider to be consistent with the complainant's version of events.
Material lies told by the appellant capable of demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. 
That the defence case that the appellant had amnesia as a result of epilepsy should be rejected. (I am referring here to the forceful evidence of the neurologist Dr Beran who said at one stage that, while everything is possible, what was being put to him by defence counsel ""would be as rare as rocking horse manure outside fairyland"").
That the appellant was not ""mentally ill"" at the time of the commission of the offence. 

100In view of the fact that the appellant is unrepresented and the significance of the issue raised under ground 3(b), I would grant leave to extend the time in which to appeal and, where necessary, grant leave to appeal.

101However, the appeal should be dismissed.

2764195,McAllan v Classic Home Improvements (Australia) Pty Ltd [2014] NSWDC 94,"Judgment

The issues in these proceedings

1The plaintiff by statement of claim filed on 10 September 2013 brings proceedings for damages against his former employer, a builder specialising in apartment construction and renovation, arising from the circumstances of an accident which occurred on 24 February 2010. The plaintiff, a 21-year old apprentice, was working under the supervision of the site foreman, Mr Bryce Daenell, when he fell while working at heights on the ceiling to a level 3 metres below, resulting in very serious head injuries. 

2As the defendant was the plaintiff's employer, the provisions of the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998 (NSW) (""the WIM Act"") apply. The plaintiff filed a pre-filing statement pursuant to s 315 and the defendant responded to that pre-filing statement in accordance with s 316. A certificate of mediation outcome was issued by the Workers Compensation Commission on 30 August 2013.

3 The provisions of s 318 limit the parties to their pre-filing statements and defences; an application by the defendant to rely upon evidence not served with the defence is set out in more detail below.

4Liability was admitted on the first day of the trial. The sole issue for determination is the plaintiff's entitlement to past and future economic loss of this very young man. I note that the difficulties in assessing economic loss for persons on the threshold of their working careers are well-recognised; in Mundy v GIO of NSW (Supreme Court of NSW, Spender AJ, 5 June 1995 at p 3) described such a task as requiring the trial judge ""to assess the unassessable"".

[Signature of the Principal]""

8The plaintiff, when he completed school, ""could fairly be described as having the world at his feet prior to the subject accident"" (Dunnett v Brennan [2000] NSWCA 211 at [24]). After the he completed his Higher School Certificate, he sought to further his career in soccer by travelling to England where he played soccer and worked in a bar; both before leaving on this working holiday and after his return he worked at Surf Dive 'n' Ski as a sales assistant. He commenced both his apprenticeship and his employment with the defendant in 2008, and completed Certificate III in Carpentry in December 2009. He was offered a contract for the 2010 soccer season by the Fernhill Soccer Club shortly thereafter.

9The plaintiff had long held ambitions of becoming a self-employed builder. His evidence was that he sought an apprenticeship with the defendant while completing a carpentry course at TAFE with this long-term plan in mind. He was proceeding well at work, sometimes being asked to be the foreman, and was doing well at his studies, which he enjoyed. He had completed his TAFE course prior to the accident, which he described as ""lucky"", but had not yet completed his apprenticeship.

10The parties agreed that, uninjured, the plaintiff would have completed his apprenticeship in January 2012.

11The plaintiff has no recollection of the circumstances of his accident, which occurred on 24 February 2010 when he was drilling a hole in the ceiling of premises being constructed by the defendant. He was knocked off his feet when the drill bit became stuck and fell about 2.5 to 3 metres onto the concrete floor. The next thing he recalls is waking up in hospital some time later. He remained in hospital for 3 weeks before being transferred to a rehabilitation hospital, where he was an in-patient until 25 May 2010.

12His accident on 24 February 2010 put an end to these activities. The severity of the plaintiff's injuries are set out in a report of Sydney South West Area Health Service of 25 May 2010 as follows:

""Mr Steven McAllan is a 21 year-old right-handed man who sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a fall at a worksite on the 24/02/2010. He reportedly fell approximately 2.5 metres backwards onto a concrete floor where he struck his head. Ambulance officers attending the scene recorded his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score as 7/15. He was taken to Wollongong Hospital, where on admission to the Emergency Department his GCS score had improved to 11/15. The initial cerebral CT scan reported a left parietal-occipital acute subdural haematoma, mass effect and partial effacement of the left lateral ventricle, and a suspected skull fracture. A follow-up CT scan on the 25/02/2010 reported that a left temporal lobe contusion had become more conspicuous, with evidence of raised intracranial pressure, midline shift to the right and a left temporal skull fracture. Mr McAllan was managed conservatively without neurosurgical intervention. Acute management occurred at Wollongong Hospital between the 24/02/2010 and 15/03/2010, and included intravenous fluids, analgesia and anticonvulsant medication. His recovery was complicated by generalized tonic-clonic seizures on two occasions, of 30-60 seconds duration. An MRI scan on the 1/03/2010 reported cortical contusions in the left parieto-temporal and left frontal lobes, a shallow left subdural haemorrhage, a minimal left parietal subarachnoid component, and more pronounced midline shift and mass effect A review CT scan on the 3/03/2010 noted contusions in the left temporal, parietal, frontal and occipital regions, with persistent midline shift. Mr McAllan was transferred to the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit (BIRU), Liverpool Hospital on the 15/03/2010 for ongoing management At die time of transfer a CT scan reported evolution of the left temporoparietal haematoma and subarachnoid haemorrhage. An EEG conducted on the 25/03/2010 reported left fronto-temporal and central regional abnormalities which were maximal over the temporal region. A Circle of Willis CT scan on the 26/03/2010 reported no evidence of an intracranial aneurysm or AVM, and noted shallow chronic left subdural haemorrhage. An MRI on the 4/01/2010 reported appearances suggestive of left frontal and left parieto-temporal contusions, and a reduction in size of the left subdural haematoma. As a result of his injury Mr McAllan sustained severe receptive and expressive dysphasia. On admission to the BIRU, Mr McAllan's speech was initially limited to a few basic words such as ""yeah"" and ""please"". It was difficult to assess duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) because of Mr McAllan's severe dysphasia, however, on the 19/03/2010 it was possible for him to understand the PTA questions and he was fully oriented and able to memorise three pictures and the therapist's name. Therefore, PTA was assessed to be less than 23 days' duration.""

13In addition to the injuries and disabilities suffered in the fall, he required hospitalisation for a lengthy period, and the following report was sent by Sydney South West Area Health Service to the GIO Workers Compensation on 25 May 2010:

""Due to the severity of his injury Mr McAllan has been hospitalised for a lengthy period which has led to a loss of strength and fitness from his pre-morbld level. Pre-morbidly Mr McAllan was working in a physically demanding role as an apprentice carpenter and was extremely physically fit and active. Socially he participated at a high level of competitive soccer, as well as regularly cycling and swimming. Physiotherapy intervention to date has involved high level mobility retraining, cardiovascular fitness retraining, and lower and upper limb strengthening exercises.

Mr McAllan's return to work is likely to be delayed by the severity of his injury, particularly, the significant receptive and expressive communication difficulties he now experiences.""

14The plaintiff made remarkable progress from his ""very severe traumatic brain injury"" (Exhibit A, p 59). The speech pathology discharge report described him as having ""severe difficulties"" in auditory comprehension, expressive communication, speech, reading and writing (Exhibit A, pp 28-35). In addition, he suffered from physical difficulties, particularly with his right upper limb, although it was ""difficult to understand exactly what he was reporting due to his language impairments"" (Exhibit A, p 21). He suffered from a right facial droop, severe expressive and receptive dysphasia, right-sided incoordination/neglect (Exhibit A, p 6). 

15However, worse was to come. Although he was able to return to light duties at work on 23 August, he was unable to complete his trade training because on 14 December 2011 he suffered a seizure resulting in suspension of his driver's licence. He suffered a second seizure and was taken to Sutherland Hospital. His driver's licence was suspended for two years. Although his medication was changed and increased, he suffered a third seizure on 30 July 2012 and was sent to St Vincent's Hospital. His driver's licence was suspended for another two years and remains currently suspended until August 2014.

16As the issues for determination are the plaintiff's past and future economic loss only, a more detailed analysis of the plaintiff's injury and disabilities needs to be seen in the context of the impact of these injuries and disabilities on his employment prospects. Accordingly, these are set out in more detail in the section on future economic loss below.

17The defendant did not serve a vocational report attached to the pre-filing defence. An application was made to rely upon this vocational report notwithstanding the failure to do so.

Defendant's application to rely upon vocational reports of Mr Burchett

18The rationale behind the tender of documents is these proceedings being restricted is set out in the relevant provisions of Part 6 of Chapter 7 of the WIM Act. These sections place limitations upon the parties to set out particulars of the claim and the evidence of the claimant. Section 316 provides:

""316 Defendant must respond to pre-filing statement

(1) The defendant must, within 28 days after the pre-filing statement has been served on the defendant, respond to the pre-filing statement by:

(a) accepting or denying liability (wholly or in part), and

(b) (to the extent, if any, that the defendant does not accept liability) serving on the claimant a defence to the claim setting out such particulars of the defence and evidence that the defendant will rely on to defend the claim as the Rules may require.

Note : A defence can be filed after 28 days but after 28 days the claimant can refer the claim to mediation under Division 4.

(2) If the defendant fails to respond to the pre-filing statement as required by this section within 42 days after it is served on the defendant, the claimant can commence court proceedings for the recovery of work injury damages.

Note : If the defendant fails to respond within 42 days, the defendant is prevented from filing a defence (see section 318) and the claimant can proceed to obtain summary judgment on the question of liability. If the defendant responds to the pre-filing statement within 42 days, the matter is required to proceed to mediation under Division 4 before court proceedings can be commenced.""

19Section 318 provides:

""318 Parties limited to pre-filing statement and defence

(1) For the purposes of court proceedings on a claim for work injury damages:

(a) the claimant is not entitled to file a statement of claim that is materially different from the proposed statement of claim that formed part of the pre-filing statement served by the claimant, except with leave of the court, and

(b) the defendant is not entitled to file a defence that is materially different from any defence served on the claimant in response to the claimant's pre-filing statement within 42 days after service of the pre-filing statement, except with leave of the court, and

(c) the defendant is not entitled to file a defence that wholly or partly disputes liability for the claim if the defendant has failed to serve on the claimant a defence to the claim as required by this Division within 42 days after the claimant served the pre-filing statement on the defendant, and

(d) a party to the proceedings is not entitled to have any report or other evidence admitted in the proceedings on the party's behalf if the report or other evidence was not disclosed by the party in a pre-filing statement or defence served under this Division, except with leave of the court.

(2) The court is not to grant leave under this section unless satisfied that:

(a) the material concerned was not reasonably available to the party when the pre-filing statement or defence was served, and

(b) the failure to grant leave would substantially prejudice the party's case.

(3) The regulations may provide for exceptions to this section.""

20The general scheme of Part 6 of Chapter 7 of the WIM Act is for the regulation of proposed pleadings and the supporting documents, which is why they are called ""pre-filing statements"" and ""pre-filing defences"". It is only after these steps have been completed and a mediation has taken place pursuant to s 318A that a statement of claim can actually be filed in court. The intention is that the parties give full disclosure of their position so that by mediation prospects of settlement can be fully explored.

21The question of the plaintiff's employability in the building industry would always have been a significant issue given the nature and severity of his injuries, and in particular after he suffered the series of epileptic seizures which resulted in the loss of his motor vehicle driver's licence. His evidence was that his employer would not allow him to use certain power tools at all, and that other power tools had to be used under supervision. He remained with his employer on light duties but the vocational capacity assessment report of Mr Martin, served with the plaintiff's pre-filing statement, stated in unequivocal terms that the plaintiff would not be able to continue his employment with the defendant and that his prospects of obtaining alternative employment in the open labour market were very poor. The report noted he was at that time working three days a week with his pre-injury employer but required supervision and further instruction to a considerable degree. 

22The plaintiff resigned from his employment on 10 May 2013 and his last day of work was on 17 May 2013. He obtained part time employment with the St George and Sutherland Community College on 20 May 2013 as a disability worker assisting persons with disability.

23The defendant was aware of the plaintiff's resignation on 10 May 2013. The pre-filing defence filed on 30 May 2013 (MFI 1) lists a series of medical reports, an investigator's report in relation to the accident and a draft defence. No vocational report of any kind was served. The precise particulars of evidence and information the defendant propose to rely upon were:

(1)""Current medical evidence addressing the plaintiff's injury, disabilities and ability to work including from a functional and vocational assessment.

(2)Evidence addressing the plaintiff's allegations of entitlement of damages for economic loss, including the plaintiff's actual and probable earnings both before and after the injury consisting of records relating to his earnings in employment with the defendant, earnings of comparable employees in the employ of the defendant, records to be obtained from the plaintiff pursuant to subpoena including taxation returns, books of accounts, business records, financial and banking records and any records relating to same within the custody possession and power of any accountant or other service provider retained by the plaintiff for such purpose, including in relation to any business conducted by or on behalf of the plaintiff.

(3)Factual evidence relating to the plaintiff's allegations in the PFS, including statements or oral evidence from witnesses, documents yet to be obtained from the defendant, records from the defendant workers compensation insurer claims file, records from any medical provider to the plaintiff including such records to be obtained pursuant to subpoena.

(4)The defendant reserves the right to adduce and rely upon such further evidence as may be necessary arising out of any response to requests for particulars, documents produced under subpoena or other evidence obtained or provided by the plaintiff hereafter.""

24Counsel for the defendant submits that the reference to ""functional and vocational assessment"" was an indication to the plaintiff that a vocational assessment would be relied upon by the defendant, and that this was to be inferred from this reference. Mr Halligan informed me from the bar table that the report of Mr Burchett which was the subject of this application was prepared in or about 27 August 2013 and served, and it appears to have played some part in, or available for, the subsequent mediation. The subsequent reports of 14 and 15 April 2014 are updates, to which the additional objection was taken that they were not served upon the plaintiff in time, although this complaint was not proceeded with.

25I do not accept this submission. The terms of paragraph (1), which is the principal basis upon which the defendant submits their reliance upon vocational material is a part of the pre-filing defence, clearly addresses only the medical evidence, in that the sentence reads ""[c]urrent medical evidence addressing the plaintiff's injury, disabilities and ability to work including from a functional and vocational assessment"" (emphasis added). The documents sought in paragraphs (2) and (3) consist of financial records only. As to paragraph (4), the plaintiff's vocational assessment was served together with the pre-filing statement and was not material of a ""further evidence"" nature, or a document which required production under subpoena.

26Some support for Mr Burchett's report still being able to be relied upon, notwithstanding its exclusion from the pre-filing defence, may be obtained from McKay v Palmers Removalists & Storage Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 83. Mr McKay brought proceedings for damages pursuant to s 151 Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW), having obtained a certificate of mediation outcome from the Workers Compensation Commission prior to commencing proceedings. Both parties in those proceedings had filed vocational material with their pre-filing statement and defence which did not refer to the plaintiff seeking or obtaining a special licence for interstate truck driving, for which the salary was higher. After his accident, the plaintiff obtained an MC licence, which was necessary for interstate truck driving, but as there was no reference in the vocational assessment prepared for the defendant of the plaintiff having obtained the necessary licence, or that he had planned to obtain a MC licence before the accident, or that he wished to be an interstate truck driver, this source of loss was not considered in the reports. The sole reference in the plaintiff's vocational report was a reference to the plaintiff having driven, and wishing to drive, heavy vehicles. The plaintiff was not cross-examined about his wish to become an interstate truck driver, as the issue arose in closing submissions, according to Mr Lidden SC (whose instructing solicitor appeared for Mr McKay).. 

27The Court of Appeal held (at [22]-[29]) that there was sufficient reference to the plaintiff's wishes to drive interstate trucks for these to have been issues arising from the vocational assessments. In addition, the failure of the defendant to cross-examine the plaintiff on critical aspects of his claim meant that a challenge to this evidence on the basis of reconstruction was not made out (at [30]-[32]). The Court, although referring the matter back to the Compensation Court for mediation, did not refer to the provisions of ss 313 to 318 of the WIM Act. 

28The question in McKay was whether there was sufficient reference to the claim in the vocational assessor's reports. Their Honours were satisfied that the reference to driving heavy vehicles and to the plaintiff having carried out interstate transport jobs was sufficient.

29Is the reference to ""functional and vocational assessment"" in paragraph (1) of the pre-filing defence, or any of the other descriptions in paragraphs (2) - (4), sufficient to include a reference to a vocational assessment report, which would accordingly be a document to be taken into account? 

30The Court of Appeal in Wilkinson v Perisher Blue Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 250 took a different view to that taken in McKay (to which no reference was made) and affirmed the decision of Robison DCJ that the defendant was not entitled to dispute liability pursuant to s 318(1)(c) of the WIM Act despite subsequent attempts to raise liability. Hoeben JA stated at [218]-[219]:

""[218] The statement of Mr Fearnside is to be found at Blue 130-138. In it Mr Fearnside analysed in considerable detail the system of work of mountain awareness officers at the resort and expressed an opinion as to the impracticality and disadvantages of the alternative systems of work proposed in Ms Armour's report. This was dealt with at paras 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 and 49 of the statement. The only reason the statement did not address a system which had a mountain awareness officer at the top of the slope and one at the bottom, but no-one in between, was because such an alternative system was not advanced on behalf of the appellant until the trial.

[219] His Honour's interpretation of s 318(1)(d) was correct. I do not read that section as requiring a verbatim transcript of the evidence which will be given at trial, but rather a disclosure of the nature and substance of the evidence to be given. The statement of Mr Fearnside satisfied that requirement. The statement did not specifically deal with the alternative system of work advanced by the appellant at trial because at the time the statement was served, that was not part of the appellant's case. In that respect, it could fairly be said that this evidence ""was not reasonably available to the party when the pre-filing defence was served"". It was common ground that the evidence was important, otherwise the objection would not have been taken.""

31Hoeben JA went on to note that Robison DCJ had correctly applied s 318(1)(d) of the WIM Act in relation to this evidence.

32The first issue is whether the evidence was available, in that the vocational report was provided at the mediation, according to counsel for the defendant. However, subsequent availability is not sufficient; the question is whether it was part of the pre-filing defence, and I am satisfied that it was not.

33The next issue is whether the vocational assessment evidence was ""not reasonably available"" when the pre-filing defence was served (s 318(2)(a)). The only explanation provided for this is that when the plaintiff resigned on 10 May 2013 the defendant was taken by surprise and did not have time to prepare a vocational assessment report. This was put from the bar table without any supporting evidence.

34The ""obligation of forensic diligence"" (Australian Winch & Haulage Co Pty Ltd v Collins [2013] NSWCA 327 at [140]) was squarely raised by the plaintiff in these proceedings, which were adjourned to the following day to enable the defendant to lead evidence in order to establish that the material was not reasonably available. In Australian Winch & Haulage Co Pty Ltd v Collins, the plaintiffs succeeded in a claim for the cost of funds management as part of his damages notwithstanding this issue not having been raised, in the absence of evidence as to efforts to obtain medico-legal evidence, but principally because this argument was not put to the trial judge (at [139]). That is not the case here. The defendant could have answered the first limb of s 318 by calling evidence. No evidence is available and this requirement fails in limine.

35Taking all of the above into account, I accept Mr Lidden SC's submissions that the decision not to call this evidence was either a tactical decision or an oversight, and not triggered by any surprise as the plaintiff giving notice on 10 May 2013 and ceasing employment on 17 May 2013, almost two weeks before the pre-filing statement was in fact filed and served in these proceedings. 

36The defendant also fails in relation to the second limb of s 318(2), namely whether failure to grant leave would substantially prejudice the party's case. Mr Halligan did not address this issue beyond stating that it was self-evident that the exclusion of this material will be forensically disadvantageous to his client.

37The medical evidence provided by the defendant is brief, inadequate and out of date. The most recent report served by the defendant is the report of Dr Mellick of 12 December 2012 in which Dr Mellick considered it was appropriate to defer final assessment of the plaintiff's language deficient until he could assess his dysphasia, which he recommended should occur six to nine months after the date of his report. No such report was prepared. Accordingly, the most recent evidence of the defendant is Dr Mellick's note of the findings of Dr Rawling, a doctor retained by the plaintiff, who reported the plaintiff making ""significant gains"" in relation to his speech function. A psychologist's report of 25 June 2012, concerning treatment early in 2012 which was described as ""brief"" and largely comprised of advice about improving his sleep, adds nothing to the medical evidence before me. Any vocational assessment report relied upon by the defendant would have to rely almost entirely on the plaintiff's medical evidence. 

38Furthermore, all of the medical evidence in these proceedings points to the plaintiff suffering a very severe head injury which has been complicated by subsequent epileptic seizures of such severity that he is currently unable to drive. Medical evidence addressing the plaintiff's injury from a functional and vocational assessment would have to take those factors into account. 

39Having regard to the way in which the parties addressed me as to computation of past and future economic loss, I cannot ascertain that the unavailability of Mr Burchett's report would ""significantly prejudice"" the party's case where the medical evidence is clear.

40Having noted my reasons for rejection of the report of Mr Burchett, I now consider the parties' submissions in relation to past and future economic loss.

Plaintiff's Schedule of Damages

41The plaintiff provided a schedule of damages (Exhibit E) as follows:





a.

Past wage lossThe plaintiff would have completed his apprenticeship (uninjured) in January 2012. Thereafter, whether in the employ of the defendant or elsewhere as a tradesman he should have earned average weekly earnings. These were $1,150 net per week. In the 2012 year the plaintiff earned $550 net per week including workers compensation payments.The loss is thereafter 26 weeks at $600 net per week = $15,600.In the 2013 financial year the plaintiff earned $650 net per week. The loss is therefore $500 net per week or $26,000.In the 2014 financial year (thus far) the plaintiff earned $497 net per week over 48 weeks. Once again this includes workers compensation and it also includes the extra hours he worked at the commencement of his current job. The loss is therefore $650 net per week for 49 weeks = $31,850.




Total loss of past wage loss therefore (to which workers Compensation payments must be added) is

$73,450



To this must be added workers compensation payments of 

$51,617



Total

$125,067


b.

Past loss of superannuation

Defendant's Schedule of Damages

42The defendant's schedule of damages consists of a detailed analysis of the plaintiff's past actual earnings. Rather than attempt to paraphrase it, I shall set it out in full:

""[Page 1]

Schedule of past economic loss

Injury 22 February 2010. Plaintiff had commenced an apprenticeship in January 2009 and was due to finish 6 January 2012.

At the time of the accident he had been a second year apprentice for several weeks at a base pay rate of $13.57 per hour. Payslips for the 6 weeks leading up to the accident show net earnings average $521.49 per week.

Actual earnings after the injury:

1. 24.02.10 - 21.8.10 - 26 weeks - nil earnings.

2. 2.8.10 [sic] - 30.6.11 - 45 weeks

Actual earnings based on the attached wage records for that period were $19,724.22 which is calculated by adding the various ""year to date"" wage components as at 30 June 2011 - $23,849.22 less the $4,125.28 which is the total of workers compensation benefits paid up to 19 August 2010.

That produces an average of $438.32 gross per week or around $410 net per week. For 45 weeks that totals $18,450

3. 1.7.2011- 30.6.2012 - 52 weeks - 

Unfortunately the pay records as attached do not show year to date earnings as at 28 June 2012. However, the attached handwritten sheet indicates total of workers compensation payments paid for that year at $10,634.48. An alternate calculation has been made adding the weekly payments paid by GIO to the employer over that period (see handwritten note in schedule attached - $10,645). Adopting that higher seond [sic] figure, that should be taken away from the figure of $34,578.74 which is the wages for that year including the workers compensation so his actual earnings clear of workers compensation were $23,933.74. That is an average of $460.26 gross per week or $425 net per week. For 52 weeks that totals $22,100

4. 1.7.2012 - 18.5.2013 - 46 weeks - 

total earnings at ""Classic"" as per payslip year to date $24,000.18 at 46 weeks so average is $523.91 gross, $475 net per week. For 46 weeks that totals $21,850

5. 19.5.2013 - 30.6.2013 - 6 weeks

payslip from St George College shows gross earnings $3,157.56. for six weeks that average is $526.17 gross or $480 net. For 6 weeks total is $2,880

6. 1.7.2013 - 5.6.2014 - 48 weeks -

St George payslip shows year to 14 May 2014 $25,014. For 45 weeks average $555.87 gross or $500 net per week. For 48 weeks total $24,000

ADDING THE 5 ""BOLD"" FIGURES 18,450 + 22,100 + 21,850 + 2280 [sic] + 24,000 = $88,680*

Notes:
* I note this figure is in error as $2,280 was added, as opposed to $2,880. The net figure should be $18,450 + $22,100 + $21,850 + $2,880 + $24,000 = $89,280
** I note this figure should have been $89,280 (see * above)
*** This figure $81,127 (being $169,807 - $88,680) is also incorrect; it should read $80,527
**** This figure should read $80,527 x 11% = $8,857.97
***** This figure was worked out as follows - $81,127 + $8,924 + $432,345 + $54,045.00 + $7,600.00 - $51,617.00. Given $80,527 should be in place of $81,127, the final figure should read $531,824.

43The defendant's estimate of future economic loss is based upon comparable earnings of Mr Bryce Daenell, who was the supervisor of the site on the day the plaintiff had his accident. The defendant had also had regard to the figures for project builders (see 42 of Mr Martin's report) and has estimated probable net earnings of the plaintiff as a project builder at being $1,050 net per week.

44The parties have also taken a different approach in relation to superannuation. The plaintiff relies upon the New South Wales Court of Appeal's approach to this issue in Najdovski v Crnojlovic (2008) 72 NSWLR 728 at [53] as follows:

""[53] It has generally been assumed that the calculation required takes as the ""relevant per centage"" the figure specified in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth) which has, since the 2002/2003 tax year, been 9 per cent of the employee's gross ordinary time earnings: see Zorom Enterprises Pty Ltd v Zabow (2007) 71 NSWLR 354 at 372 [72] (Campbell JA). (For ease of calculation, and because damages are assessed by reference to earnings net of tax, the calculation is sometimes undertaken on the basis of 11 per cent of net earnings.)""

45The defendant provided an outline of reasons for an estimate of 12 to 12.5% in a short memorandum provided to the Court, the relevant portions of which are as follows:

(1)The superannuation levy is only payable on a worker's ""ordinary time earnings"".

(2)The Court of Appeal has determined that loss of superannuation ought to be based on 9% (as at the time of gross loss earnings). For the reasons indicated above would only be 9% of the proportionate gross earnings to which the statutory superannuation guarantee levy applies - that is based earnings and not overtime.

(3)It has been generally accepted that because it is usual to calculate economic loss on a net of tax basis that an approximation of 9% of gross earnings is 11% of net earnings, and that calculations for past and future loss of superannuation has been often done on a guideline basis of the 11% of net earnings.

(4)As the defendant understands, the plaintiff's calculation of future loss of superannuation based on 14.36% of future net loss of earnings is based on an actuarial table prepared by Furzer Crestani based on the assumption that over the next six years there is to be a progressive increase in the compulsory superannuation guarantee levy up to 12%. The defendant notes that the current government has already deferred the introduction of that increase and the defendant contends that on that basis some discount would be applied as for the doubt to whether the full proposed increase will be implemented.

(5)Moreover, however, as indicated above the levy is only base earnings. It appears the plaintiff's assertion as to what would be the plaintiff's probable earnings but for the injury would include the plaintiff being likely to be in work where he received overtime or other bonuses and that portion of his probable earnings would not have attracted the superannuation guarantee levy and that should be considered a factor in reducing the claim 14.36% of net.

(6)Furthermore, the defendant asserts there is no clear evidence that people who are on salary or non-award rates will ultimately get the full benefit of that progressive increase in superannuation guarantee percentages. Most persons who would be earning what is asserted to be the probable earnings of the plaintiff but for the injury would come as a package, and the defendant contends that it is likely that part of any superannuation increases for such persons would be at least partly absorbed in smaller wage rises with the employer looking at the increase in the combined salary and superannuation package figure.

(7)If it is being asserted that the plaintiff's probable earnings but for the injury as a self-employed builder and if he was self-employed he would get no superannuation from an employer.

(8)In all of the circumstances the defendant contends that a figure of 12-12.5% of assessed net future economic loss should be the maximum added for potential loss of superannuation.

46I note the agreement between the parties as to Fox v Wood. I shall first deal with the issue of past wage loss.

Past wage loss

47The principal difference between the plaintiff and defendant on this issue is the amount the plaintiff would have had earned as a ""first year out"" tradesman. The defendant considers that the plaintiff would have continued to work at the same trade of being a carpenter and his earnings would have been comparable to his fellow carpenter, Bryce Daenell. The plaintiff has carried out the same exercise having regard to average weekly earnings of $1,150 net per week.

48The question is the degree of probability that, had the plaintiff been uninjured, he would have exercised his earning capacity by becoming a self-employed builder, in accordance with the principle set out in Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd (No 2) (1990) 169 CLR 638. As is set out in more detail below, I have assessed future economic loss on that basis. Although the plaintiff would have been a first year out tradesman, the likelihood is that a young man of his capabilities would have received average weekly earnings for the sum proposed by the plaintiff. Taking the deductions for workers compensation payments which are common to both formulae, the figure for past wage loss is $73,450, to which must be added workers compensation payments of $51,617.

49This brings me to the question of past loss of superannuation.

50The formula is not in dispute here and the appropriate amount for past loss of superannuation is $13,757.

Future wage loss

51When determining the plaintiff's future wage loss, I have taken into account his evidence as to his future capabilities, the comments of Mr Martin and, most importantly, the medical evidence before the court. In his report, Mr Martin refers to three particular reports, namely the reports of Kasey Metcalf, Lynette Wong and Dr Lorentz.

52The most recent medical report for the plaintiff paint a gloomy picture of his ability to cope. Kasey Metcalf describes his current speech therapy problems as follows:

""Word-finding difficulties were clearly evident during the interview, but he was able to convey his message sufficiently when given sufficient time and mild prompts.""

""His performance on working memory tasks fell within the borderline impaired range overall and equivalent to previous performance. His ability to recite increasingly lengthy series of number (i.e. immediate attention) was reduced. His performance was also below average when he was required to manipulate verbal information in mind.""

""His performance on mental arithmetic was in the low average range, but he demonstrated the basic capacity to calculate simple sums in mind. His performance on a task of written mathematical computations was also in the low average range for his age and suggested that he had a basic understanding of everyday maths. His ability to read and comprehend increasingly complex sentences was also low average and suggested that he had functional reading comprehension skills.""

""On current testing, he demonstrated areas of continued cognitive weakness that included inefficiency in his auditory immediate attention, working memory and poor divided attention. However, his new learning and memory for verbal material was within the normal range and his capacity to perform mental and written calculations was adequate for everyday financial affairs."" (Exhibit A, pp 33-34)

53Similarly, in relation to his writing ability, Lynette Wong states:

""His main difficulties with study are with organised succinct verbal/written expression, spelling and processing the information into modules. Once he has formulated an answer he reported the thought is lost with the distraction of trying to spell even high frequency words. This seems to be related to ongoing difficulties with working memory and being able to hold information while processing other information.""

""During conversation the difficulties with verbal expression continue to be evident. He has extreme difficulty relating even fairly uncomplicated sequences. This is further exacerbated by word finding difficulties with result and verbose and circulatory verbal and written expression. The articulatory difficulties relate to ongoing verbal dyspraxia."" (Exhibit A, p 34)

54Dr Lorentz gave the following description:

""His reading was very slow and laboured and he mispronounced words.
I asked him to write down his activities on the morning of the examination and he wroteas follows: ""I get the train from Como to the city and walk down York Street to see the doctor.""

""He did this very slowly and was obviously grammatically incorrect.""

""Mr McAllan has difficulty with communications some four years after his injury so that he is unlikely to improve significantly in the future. He may have difficulty in following more complicated or complex instructions and he will have difficulty of expressing himself verbally and in writing limiting his employability."" (Exhibit A, p 33)

55Drawing upon each of these, Mr Martin has produced a comprehensive vocational capacity assessment report. He summarises the plaintiff's employment and earning capacity but for the injury as follows:

""But for the injury, Mr McAllan stated it was his intention to complete his Apprenticeship as a Carpenter, and complete formal qualifications to gain a Builders licence, and work as a Project Builder (Carpenter/Builder). Mr McAllan would have probably been capable of working as a Carpenter/Builder but for the injury. He would probably have been capable of owning and running his own business. Other occupations that would have been available to Mr McAllan in the building industry in the longer term include Foreman/Supervisor or Site and Construction Manager. Mr McAllan would probably also have been capable of working in these occupations.

In the short term (3-5 years), Mr McAllan would probably have worked as a Carpenter/Builder (Project Builder) and earned at least $1,550 gross per week as at May 2014.

In the longer term, after approximately 6 years, Mr McAllan would have been able to work as a Foreman/Supervisor and earn $2,229 gross per week and after further experience as a Site and Construction Manager and earn $2,334 gross per week."" (Exhibit A, p 30)

56The defendant's medical evidence can add little if anything to this sombre picture. The most that Dr Mellick can opine is that a remarkable improvement in speech function ""may occur after brain injury"" and to refer to the ""significant gains"" noted by Dr Rawling in relation to the plaintiff's speech. As the plaintiff was unable to say more than a few words after the accident, and spent many months in intensive therapy before being able to have a conversation with his doctors (some of whom have commented on the difficulties of this), this opinion is of little assistance.

57I have had the benefit of hearing the plaintiff speaking while he was giving evidence and being cross-examined. I have also had the opportunity to compare what he says about his abilities with what these have been found to be by Mr Martin.

58An example of the plaintiff's problems in relation to both speech and cognitive function can be seen from his misunderstanding of several questions he was asked in cross-examination. In particular, when Mr Halligan asked if he was able to bath persons who came to the disability centre, the plaintiff agreed that he did so. In re-examination, Mr Lidden SC enquired whether the plaintiff did in fact bath the persons who came to the disability centre. It transpired that the plaintiff had confused the words ""bath"" and ""bathroom"" and had simply not understood the question. 

59There were other answers that the plaintiff gave which seemed inconsistent or unlikely; this ""bath/bathroom"" was simply one example which was explored in re-examination, where his errors were obvious. This was not a trivial error by a witness who was not paying attention; the plaintiff gave the impression that he was listening to questions intently and answering them to the best of his ability. This was an example of the plaintiff's cognitive faculties failing. 

60There were a number of examples of the plaintiff's speech problems in the course of his oral evidence. On several occasions Mr Lidden SC directed my attention to the plaintiff's slight stutter and to his habit of stopping to search for a word. 

61Towards the end of the cross-examination, he became very visibly tired and tended to agree with many of the questions he was asked. For example, he agreed with all of the questions about how he was enjoying his work as a disability services officer, which appeared to be inconsistent with his avowed wish to become a self-employed builder. The gaps while he searched for words became longer and after a while he began just to agree. To my observation, the plaintiff simply missed the significance of the questions he was being asked. The statement he made earlier in his evidence, namely that it took him some time to accept that he was going to have to give up his dream of becoming a self-employed builder, seems to me a more accurate description of the plaintiff's real state of mind on these issues. The contrast between his answers early in examination in chief, when occasional flashes of the impressive young man he must have been before he suffered his accident, and his monotonal and stuttering answers at the end of cross-examination, was quite marked.

62Finally, although the plaintiff minimised his physical and mental disabilities and painted himself as someone who was coping with his day to day life, the evidence set out in Mr Martin's report painted a different picture. In particular, the plaintiff described himself as being able to send email and use a computer. This was relied upon by Mr Halligan in his closing submissions in relation to the plaintiff's future employability. However, Mr Martin's report (Exhibit D, p 13) notes that the plaintiff is unable to touch type, admitted to him that his keyboard skills were ""poor"", had done very little typing since his injury, had very poor spelling and would probably be slower typing now. I note that in his evidence, the plaintiff volunteered, when describing his computer skills, that Spell Check was a ""godsend"".

63Given the plaintiff's difficulties in speaking and reading, I accept the Mr Martin's estimate of the plaintiff's computer skills as between very basic and basic is more accurate than the more positive view expressed by Mr Halligan based upon apparent admissions by the plaintiff in cross-examination. 

64Nor do I regard the fact that the plaintiff possesses or is able to use a smartphone, or that he can send an email, is indicative of his having significant computer skills. As Mr Martin notes at p 14 of his report, basic computer skills would require far more than these skills, such as the ability to produce documents in standard format at 20 words per minute. Most persons in the plaintiff's age bracket possess smartphones, and can send emails; it is unrealistic to regard the ability to perform such functions as evidence of anything other than the most basic computer literacy. 

65In addition, many jobs are closed to the plaintiff by reason of his history of epileptic seizures and taking epileptic medication. Whether or not his motor vehicle licence is returned to him, the likelihood of his obtaining employment where any driving is involved, given this history, is low. Nor is it appropriate to consider jobs in the hospitality industry where he is serving alcohol. The medical reports make clear that the plaintiff must not take alcohol, and that he has in fact ceased taking any form of alcohol since his accident. Jobs such as handyman or store employee would be difficult, as the plaintiff cannot perform work at height, which would mean employment at any large store such as a hardware store would be unsuitable. 

66Ultimately, the plaintiff's future employment possibilities consist of work in the area in which he currently finds himself, such as a disability services officer, which is an idea environment for a young man who himself suffers from significant disabilities.

67Mr Martin describes the plaintiff's current earning capacity as follows:

""Mr McAllan is currently earning $22 gross per hour for approximately 3.5 days per week ($585.20 gross per week). PAYG summary for the period 13 May 2013 to 30 June 2013 show earnings of $3,157.56 gross or $460.50 per week.""

68Mr Martin describes the plaintiff's future employment and earning capacity as very poor, giving a ""25% possibility"" only. He states that the plaintiff's ""anticipated income in the long term is 25% of $607.80 being $151.95 gross per week"".

69The first issue for consideration is the plaintiff's ability to sustain his current employment. I shall deal with this before dealing with his stated preference, namely to work as a self-employed builder.

The plaintiff's work as a disability services officer

70The plaintiff's evidence was that he enjoyed his work as a disability services officer, and that he had enrolled in a course which he anticipated completing towards the end of the year, which would give him a formal qualification in order to do the work he is currently doing.

71Although counsel for the defendant encouraged me to take an optimistic view of the plaintiff's employability and current employment, the terms of his letter of appointment are quite clear. This is a job which depends firstly upon government funding being available, as this letter makes out:

""Grading will be as per the SGSCC Enterprise Agreement 2011 and/or the SCHADS Award. Your conditions of employment will be as follows:

1. Your contract is - Part Time subject to funding being available. Whilst you have been designated days and working hours, due to the flexibility of our service, days and working hours may change to meet the needs of the people we support. This will undertaken by negotiation and notice.

...

8. Due to the SGSCC DisAbility Department being Government funded as well as being Person Centered Funded, funding levels may decrease or be withdrawn at any time which may effect a change in working hours and or your employment. You will be notified two (2) weeks in advance if this occurs.""

72Mr Martin notes that disability services officers, who work with challenging clients, generally do not have a long career because of the nature of their work being emotionally and mentally demanding. In addition to this, the plaintiff's communication skills are, Mr Martin considers, below a level that would be expected of a person who proficiently performed such a role. Taking these into account, as well as the fact that employment in the disability sector is ""subject to government funding which may not be ongoing"" (Mr Martin's report, p 35) the plaintiff suffers from a long list of difficulties which make his employment in this area very poor. Mr Martin has summarised these as follows:

(a)Fit for part time hours of work (up to 3.5 days per week);

(b)Approximately 33% of Disabilities Services Officers jobs are part time (Job Markets Australia 2013-14);

(c)Females hold about 70% of Disabilities Services Officers jobs (Job Markets Australia 2013-14);

(d)Severe traumatic brain injury;

(e)Impaired cognitive functioning;

(f)Impaired memory;

(g)Impaired concentration;

(h)Oral comprehension difficulties;

(i)Oral expression difficulties;

(j)Difficulty answering questions;

(k)Impaired reading ability;

(l)Impaired writing ability;

(m)Impaired learning ability;

(n)Inability to undertake complex problem solving activities;

(o)Fatigue affecting and limiting work capacity;

(p)Risk of further seizures;

(q)Fear of being assaulted and causing brain injury;

(r)Risk of assault from challenging clients with disabilities;

(s)No drivers licence restricting availability of potential employment;

(t)Ongoing medication issues impacting on employment capacity (causing drowsiness and fatigue);

(u)Inability to drive;

(v)Inability to work without the risk of seizures;

(w)Need for supervision at work;

(x)Anxiety state;

(y)Depressed mood;

(z)Sleeping difficulties;

(aa)Relies on memory aids;

(bb)Low self esteem;

(cc)Low self confidence.

73I am satisfied that the plaintiff's prospect of sustaining employment on the open labour market, as opposed to the very favourable conditions he currently enjoys, are ""very poor"" (Martin report, p 10).

74I take into account additional matters stated by the plaintiff in his evidence which are not referred to in Mr Martin's report. The plaintiff is able to walk to his place of employment, as it is close to his home. His ability to drive remains an uncertainty, but even something as simple as being able to get to and from work, or to take disabled persons to medical appointments or outside a disability centre, are matters which would probably be beyond the plaintiff's skills. 

75In addition, I had an example of the impact of tiredness upon the plaintiff while he was giving evidence. He has been able to structure his work week, at his present place of employment, in order to allow for this problem, but other employers may not be so generous. He became extremely tired during cross-examination and was visibly struggling to answer questions. His speech defects, including stuttering and being unable to remember words, became more pronounced, as I have set out above.

76I am satisfied, given his current circumstances, that the likelihood that he could sustain employment in the long term in this kind of work is 25% at best.

77This brings me to the question of his future employment in the building industry.

Work in the building industry

78The plaintiff's evidence was that if he had not suffered the accident which occurred, he would have completed his apprenticeship as a carpenter as well as formal qualification to gain a builder's licence and work as a builder, whether as a project builder or carpenter builder. He would have had the benefit of being self-employed and would have planned to own and run his own business. Other possibilities were that he would become a foreman or a supervisor on site for a construction manager, but given this impressive young man's abilities, the likelihood that he would have become a builder is one which I am confident would have occurred.

79Having regard to the principles set out in Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd (No 2), supra, I am satisfied that but for his injury the plaintiff would not simply have completed his apprenticeship, but completed formal qualifications to gain a builder's licence and work as a carpenter, project builder or a self-employed builder. Alternatively, he may have worked in other occupations of a similar kind and earn the average full time earnings of a male New South Wales worker. This was not a young man who would have remained a carpenter for the rest of his working life. Accordingly, I am satisfied that I should adopt the formula based on average weekly earnings proposed by the plaintiff which gives a future wage loss of $943,296.

80I am satisfied that the plaintiff's actual loss is the figure of $1,200 per week having regard to the severity of his injuries. I am satisfied that his current employment is extremely uncertain. He can lose his job at any time due to withdrawal of funding. In addition, I take into account Mr Martin's comments about the distressing nature of such work, resulting in many employees in this field not working in such positions until retirement age. Finally and most importantly, the plaintiff is still not able to work a 5-day week, and has had to adapt the hours where he is working to allow for the fact that the most he can manage is a 3-4 day week. He currently has a very indulgent employer, he cannot rely upon having indulgent employers for the rest of his working life.

81I agree with Mr Martin's assessment that the plaintiff's future employment prospects are poor.

Future loss of superannuation

82I have referred to the formula set out in Najdovski v Crnojlovic, supra, and conformably with my findings in that regard, I propose to award the sum sought by the plaintiff for future loss of superannuation, namely $135,427. 

83There is one issue with which I should deal in the defendant's submissions in relation to the question of future superannuation, and that is the submission that if the plaintiff was self-employed ""he would get no superannuation from an employer"". This is an unmeritorious submission. The plaintiff has lost the opportunity to be a self-employed builder in circumstances where he would most probably set up a company which employed him and paid him superannuation, or alternatively had his own private superannuation scheme. The significant benefits which flow from being self-employed are often difficult to calculate when looking at future economic loss, but a submission that no allowance should be made for superannuation on the basis that the plaintiff would not have any because he was not an employee is not a submission which should be made in the context of expectations that all workers will provide for themselves at the end of their working lives from superannuation schemes of one sort or another.

Fox v Wood

84This has been agreed at $7,600.

Orders

85Although I have accepted the sums sought by the plaintiff, I have left the parties the task of confirming the mathematically agreed sum of damages, in view of the mathematical errors set out in [42] above, as well as granting liberty to apply in relation to costs.

(1)Judgment for the plaintiff.

(2)Defendant pay plaintiff's costs.

(3)Parties have liberty to apply in relation to costs, as well as bring in Short Minutes of Order reflecting the judgment sum and the payback amount to the workers compensation insurer.

(4)Exhibits retained until further order.

2764201,"R v Guerrera, Nicolino [2014] NSWDC 347","Decision


	
	HER HONOUR: The accused is before the Court facing trial on 13 counts of sexual assault against the named complainant. Counts 1 to 10 inclusive in the indictment are offences contrary to s 61E(1), then in force, alleging that on ten separate occasions over a period between 1 January 82 and 24 December 83, that is over a period of two years, the accused indecently assaulted the named complainant.
	
	
	There is a further element asserted that she was under the age of 16. Whether or not that is necessary is to be dealt with in due course and is not a matter necessary for determination for the purposes of this issue before me. Each of these charges, counts 1 to 10, is in exactly the same terms and covers a time period when the complainant was aged between seven and nine, she having been born on 23 May 1974.
	
	
	Each of those counts alleges the offences occurred at Rozelle. Count 11 is a charge contrary to s 61E(2) of the Crimes Act of committing an act of indecency in the presence of the complainant who was under the age of 16. This offence is alleged to have occurred between 25 March 83 and 24 December 83 at Rozelle when the complainant was aged between eight and nine. Counts 12 and 13 are charges that the accused had carnal knowledge of the complainant when she was under ten. These are charges contrary to s 67 of the Crimes Act then in force. Count 12 is alleged to have occurred at Rozelle between 25 March and 24 March 83 when the complainant was eight or nine and count 13 is alleged to have occurred at Drummoyne on 24 December 1983 when the complainant was nine.
	
	
	As I understand it, the complainant made a formal complaint to police about these offences in May 2011. The accused was questioned by police on 13 December 2011, he denied the allegations but on legal advice declined to make any further statement. It is not clear on the material before me when he was charged with these offences.
	
	
	Three subpoenas were issued on behalf of the accused on about 23 April 2014 from this Court's criminal registry in Sydney. They appear to have been issued during preparation for this trial, which commenced before me on 24 June, that is, two days ago. They were to three separate hospitals, cast in fairly broad terms, but not unusually so for subpoenas seeking hospital records. They were issued to Cumberland Hospital, Westmead, Sydney South Pacific Private Hospital, Curl Curl and Bowral Hospital.
	
	
	None of them seeks access to sexual assault counselling in the notes as such and there is nothing before me on this application to indicate that there was any information available to either the accused's legal representatives, or for that matter to the Crown, about the existence of or identity of any specific sexual assault counselling involving the complainant being undertaken at the time these subpoenas were issued. The subpoenas sought the medical files of the complainant generally but in each case for a period of specific admissions.
	
	
	For Cumberland Hospital this was from 1 June 2006 to the present. For the Sydney South Pacific Private Hospital that was from 1 January 2010 to the present and for Bowral Hospital that was for a nominated period in 2013.
	
	
	There is nothing to suggest that the accused's legal representatives expected to find anything in the nature of specific sexual assault counselling from any of these. They were aware, I accept, in general terms that the admissions to these hospitals had been for other apparently non related reasons, in particular they were aware that the admission to Sydney South Pacific Hospital, which is a drug and alcohol rehabilitation hospital, was a self referral by the complainant made in September 2010 when she was seeking to be involved in a 12 Step alcohol rehabilitation program following her being involved in a car accident in April 2010, being charged with an offence of DUI, being dealt with in the Local Court and then appealing to the District Court.
	
	
	They were aware that in those District Court proceedings a report had been tendered under the hand of Dr Ben Teo, psychiatrist, setting out some history including references to admissions to Cumberland Hospital for reasons not specifically connected with any sexual assault allegations and also references to the treatment program at Sydney South Pacific Hospital.
	
	
	There is nothing in the terms of the subpoenas nor in the circumstances in which the fact of these admissions became known which, on their face, would have alerted anyone to the possibility that protected confidences might be claimed. It was known to the accused's legal representatives that in relation to the admissions to Cumberland and Sydney South Pacific Hospital, these occurred well before the allegations were made by the complainant in relation to the accused.
	
	
	It would appear that each institution produced a bundle of documents in response to the subpoena issued to it and no claims were made by any of the hospitals. Although the file does not assist me to determine this, it would appear that subpoenas were returned in the normal way and access was granted to them in the normal way, including an opportunity for photocopying of the documents.
	
	
	I am informed that once the Crown Prosecutor started to read the documents, it raised in his mind the possibility that at least some of those documents in the files contained counselling communications as defined in the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986 which would amount to protected confidences pursuant to the relevant provisions of that Act. The documents and photocopies were thus returned to the Court, a solicitor was appointed to appear for the complainant, the protected confider, and the accused's call for access to the documents was renewed when the trial came before me two days ago, on Tuesday 24 June 2014.
	
	
	The subpoenas were obviously issued without leave. Section 298 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that in criminal proceedings a subpoena which seeks the production of documents which records a protected confidence cannot be issued without leave of the Court and nor can there be production of those documents.
	
	
	Production in this section appears to mean access to parties to subpoenaed documents, not merely production of documents to the Court for consideration of other applications. Whilst the terms of s 298(1) would seem to be mandatory and there could easily be a valid view that any subpoena issued without leave should simply be set aside as ultra vires, in fact with respect I prefer the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal in KS v Veitch (No 2) unreported decision of the New South Wales CCA at 266 where Basten J in similar circumstances determined that although the subpoena was issued irregularly, and because the tests for granting access are the same as the tests for granting leave to issue a subpoena, that it was open to the trial court to disregard the irregularity when determining whether or not the accused could have access to the documents. With respect I propose to follow that course.
	
	
	Section 298(2) then provides that access can only be given to documents, which record a protected confidence, with leave of the Court, in criminal proceedings. That is the issue here for my determination, namely whether or not the accused, and by extension the Crown, should be granted leave to access any of the documents produced by the hospitals in response to the subpoenas.
	
	
	It is first necessary to determine exactly what these documents contain and therefore whether they fall within the provisions of Part 5 Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986 entitled,
	


“Sexual Assault Communications Privilege”.


	
	As I said the complainant has claimed a sexual assault communications privilege over the entirety of the material produced in response to each of the three subpoenas and she has been represented by a solicitor on the return of subpoenas and the subsequent argument.
	
	
	The solicitor has advised the Court that in his view all of the material produced fits the description of a counselling communication. In order to meet the anticipated application for leave to access the documents that solicitor has gone through the three files and also conferred with counsel for the accused in relation to the forensic purpose identified by him. As a result the solicitor for the complainant has placed yellow tabs on various parts of those files in which he is of the view that the material at those pages may have some probative value, in light of those discussions with counsel for the accused, and having some knowledge of the subject matter of the trial.
	
	
	For the purposes of this argument I have also read all of the contents of these three bundles and myself placed orange tabs on some of the documents, which in my view may have some probative value both for the accused and the Crown in relation to the issues, which I anticipate, are likely to arise in this trial. To a large extent the orange tabs that I have placed on the file correspond with those placed by the solicitor for the complainant, but not entirely.
	
	
	Just like Berman DCJ in R v Markarian [2012] NSWDC 197 I have spent some considerable time doing that, particularly as many of the documents are in handwriting, some on their face are hard to categorise as to their purpose or reason for creation, the authors of many are either unidentified or cannot be ascertained because there is an illegible signature, and in any event even where known, the person's occupation is not always provided.
	
	
	Also just like Berman DCJ I am conscious that there is a vast amount of irrelevant material which is always likely to be the case in a normal hospital file, containing as it does documents like drug charts, hourly observation notes and the like. I also have to make my own assessment of whether or not a particular document is not only a counselling communication but is also likely to have the necessary probative value, at the beginning of the trial, without any evidence having been called, and in particular without hearing the evidence of the complainant, and to some extent therefore second-guessing the full extent of the issues likely to arise.
	
	
	As I perceive it though, the issues which are likely to arise, having had access to these hospital records which would be likely to have at least some probative value, in particular relate to issues of the complainant's credibility, reliability and accuracy as a witness. These allegations are a little more than 30 years old. There is, as I understand it, no supportive evidence of the complainant's allegations. There is yet to be an argument in relation to the admissibility of certain evidence that broadly falls within the description of complaint evidence, but I do not as yet know much of the details of that, and that of which I am aware it seems to me is to an extent vague and lacks the sort of specificity as to time, which would make it unlikely that these could be relied on as complaint evidence as such. It is more likely that at most they would be admissible pursuant to s 108(3) of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	As I have said however that is an argument yet to be had. Even that may be subject to further argument it seems to me. if there are significant inconsistencies within those versions, so that it could never properly be used to re-establish credit.
	
	
	The Crown has tendered a written version of the opening he would propose to give to the jury in this trial and from that it is clear that the Crown accepts that its case is almost entirely dependent on the evidence of the complainant, who must be accepted, as to the elements for each of the offences, beyond reasonable doubt, after careful scrutiny, if there are to be convictions in relation to any of these charges.
	
	
	As such therefore her credibility, accuracy and reliability are pivotal to this trial. I have been made aware on behalf of the accused that in relation to three of the charges there will be evidence called from which it will be argued that the specific acts alleged by the complainant are a physical impossibility because of the place in which the events are said to have occurred and simply did not occur as to one because the surrounding circumstances alleged simply did not occur. As I understand it there will be other evidence, at least as to three counts, which calls into question, at the very least, the complainant's accuracy and reliability and I am told her credibility will be put in issue as well. There is a degree of overlap in relation to each of the charges and so the issues of credibility, reliability and accuracy are vital for all counts, not just those three where is specific contrary evidence.
	
	
	Having then determined to allow the subpoenas to be called on, even though issued without leave, I must then decide a number of things, given that the complainant has claimed privilege over the entirety of the three files.
	
	
	First, are there, in fact, protected confidences reported in any of the documents? Second, if not, should access be given to the files, or parts of them, in any event, on an assessment of the likely relevance of those and therefore whether or not a legitimate forensic purpose can otherwise be established? Third, if so, should leave be granted for access to the documents?
	
	
	For the purpose of these considerations it is necessary to look to the provisions of this extremely poor legislation.
	
	
	A “protected confidence” is defined in s 296(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986 as meaning a counselling communication that is made by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence.
	
	
	S296 (2) provides that something can be a protected confidence even if it is a counselling communication made before any allegation of a sexual assault and also even if not made in connection with a sexual assault offence.
	
	
	S296(4) defines “Counselling communication” as a communication:
	



	
	Made in confidence by a person (the counselled person) to another person (the counsellor) who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered, or
	
	
	Made in confidence to or about the counselled person by the counsellor in the course of that counselling, or
	
	
	Made in confidence about the counselled person by a counsellor or parent, carer or other supportive person who is present to facilitate communication between the counselled person and the counsellor or to otherwise further the counselling process, or
	
	
	Made in confidence by or to the counsellor by or to another counsellor or by or to a person who is counselling or has at any time counselled the person.
	



	
	“Counsellor” is defined for the purposes of S296 in this way:
	


S296 (5) A person counsels another person if:


	
	The person has undertaken training or study or has experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm, and
	
	
	The person:
	



	
	Listens to and gives verbal or other support or encouragement to the other person, or
	
	
	Advises, gives therapy to or treats the other person,
	


whether or not for fee or reward.


	
	The first task then is to determine, are there counselling communications recorded in these hospital notes, which become protected confidences pursuant to those provisions?
	
	
	As I have said I have read all of these notes, as I must do, but I am assisted by a degree of practicality employed by both counsel for the accused and the solicitor for the complainant. There are large portions of all files to which the accused’s counsel does not seek access because he acknowledges that they are not likely to be relevant and thus not of any probative value.
	
	
	I will deal first of all with the subpoena to Bowral Hospital, which is the matter I dealt with yesterday but now by way of formal findings.
	
	
	As advised yesterday, having read that file relating to two admissions in 2013, I characterise the documents on the whole as being general hospital records, relating to admissions not directly connected with any allegation of sexual assault, for very short periods only and comprising largely triage nurse notes, ward nurse observations, drug charts and the like.
	
	
	They may well fall within the broad definition of counselling communications if I were to infer that nurses in a general hospital come within the definition of counsellor, but it seems to me that it's not necessary for me to decide that. Having read the documents, as indicated yesterday, it appears to me there is nothing in that file, whether characterised as counselling communication or not, which could have any probative value in relation to the identified issues in this trial, let alone substantive probative value.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused advised yesterday that he was content with that approach and I confirm the order made yesterday that there be no access granted to any documents in those subpoenaed documents from Bowral Hospital.
	
	
	As to the other two bundles, as Berman DCJ remarked in Markarian’s case, there are always going to be large quantities of material in hospital files that are irrelevant. Equally, it seems to me that there are always likely to be quantities of material in general hospital files which could never fall within the definition of counselling communications, and as such it appears to me unhelpful that a claim for privilege is made in relation to the entirety of a hospital file. Into that category it seems to me falls, for example, drug charts which, in my view, by no stretch of the definition in this Act, could be called a counselling communications, thus attracting the privilege.
	
	
	However, having read all of the documents in those two other bundles, as would no doubt be expected from hospital files, the vast bulk of both of these seem to be a standard hospital records. They include drug charts, nurse’s ward observations, ward nurses' notes and the like. Without needing to decide whether or not these, in fact, amount to counselling communications, they are not either likely to be probative of any of the issues identified and advised to me following consultation between the solicitor for the complainant and counsel for the accused and thus there could be no legitimate forensic purpose demonstrated for those parts of the files.
	
	
	As confirmed yesterday, counsel for the accused has agreed that, for the purpose of this argument, my attention should be directed only to those documents on which either yellow or orange tabs have been placed either by me or the solicitor for the complainant and as I understand it, is content to accept a ruling that the balance of all documents in those two files, even if they amount to counselling communications, and I'm far from satisfied that they all do, nonetheless are not relevant and thus he does not seek access to those.
	
	
	I will then concentrate on those documents, which are tabbed in that way. First of all the documents, which appear in the Cumberland Hospital files cover two admissions. The first is an admission on 25 June 2008, the second is an admission on 24 June 2010. As the documents are produced the notes work from the most recent admission backwards so I will therefore deal with the second admission first.
	
	
	The first yellow tab placed there by the solicitor for the complainant appears to be a discharge summary written on 30 June, apparently in relation to a discharge on 20 June and apparently written by a psychiatrist. On its face it contains material about interaction between the complainant and a number of people, all of whom seem to have psychiatric or psychological qualifications. It must be noted, of course, that Cumberland Hospital is a psychiatric hospital.
	
	
	By inference they are counsellors within the terms of the definition in the Act. It seems to me that it probably falls within the definition of counselling communication or in fact a summary of things that happened during that admission but I do not propose to grant access to that document because even if it is a counselling communication there is nothing in it in my view which could be said to have substantial probative value in relation to the issues identified. It is not necessary, in my view, for a balancing exercise to be undertaken.
	
	
	The first orange tab is one placed there by me, which also corresponds with a yellow tab placed by the solicitor for the complainant and is a document referred to as a mental health assessment which, on its face, appears to have occurred sometime following 23 June 2010 at 11.55pm.
	
	
	All of the sources of the information in that document appear to have come either from or about the complainant. This seems to have been signed by a person called a CMO, which I accept is some form of medical officer. As I have said Cumberland Hospital is a psychiatric hospital. By inference I accept that it is possible that such a person, simply by virtue of their office there, falls within the definition of counsellor for the purposes of the Act.
	
	
	The reason for the complainant's admission to the hospital on this occasion falls within the definition of harm, but on its face has no connection at all with any sexual assault, more likely than not arising as a result of relationship difficulties. But what is occurring on the face of this document is that the person, whomever he or she might be, is taking a history from the complainant on initial presentation to the hospital during the course of a mental health assessment.
	
	
	On its face therefore it is a communication, in confidence, between the complainant and this CMO, so on its face it falls within the definition of counselling communication, even though in my view it was never the intention of the legislation that such a broad application apply.
	
	
	There is a portion of this mental health assessment entitled, ""History presenting problem"". There is a portion towards the end of that entry which, on its face, appears to have some probative value in relation to the issues to be tried here, including circumstances in which the complainant made allegations about physical abuse by her father, that is the therapeutic circumstances in which that occurred, and also issues in relation to her reliability, based on consistency of complaint. I make that comment about an allegation of physical assault by the complainant's father because I'm aware that this is not a matter solely within the purview of these documents, but appears otherwise in the statements that have been tendered on this application.
	
	
	As I have said, whilst there is scant evidence about the person who took this history, I accept by inference that it is likely to be a counselling communication, and if leave is to be granted to it, that can only occur in accordance with the provisions of s 299D, which I will come to in due course. However, it is a document which I accept is a counselling communication and about which I must make a decision.
	
	
	Some of the following yellow tabs for that admission are on their face by inference also counselling communications, but either, in my view, amount to a repetition of the material which appears in the mental health assessment, which I will address in due course on the question of leave, or do not, on their face, raise any other issues of probative value.
	
	
	A document which I have called the fourth yellow tab, but which I am conscious is probably about six, but in any event is a tab which appears to be a drug chart only. In my view, that is not a counselling communication, but neither is there any probative value. In any event, I am informed on behalf of the accused as to the only potentially relevant drug appearing in that charge, namely Effexor, that that information or evidence in relation to that drug and its connection with the complainant is available from another source, and as such, for that combinations of reasons, would not grant access either.
	
	
	As to the first admission, in summary, there is one document which in my view clearly falls into the definition of counselling communication for which the privilege can be claimed, and I will be required to make a determination pursuant to s 299D as to whether or not leave will be granted.
	
	
	As to the second admission, dated 25 June 2008, the first yellow tab attached by the complainant, appeared to be an admission or referral document. It is hard to know who is the author of that document, but as I keep saying, Cumberland Hospital is a psychiatric hospital and on its face it is signed by a person described as a registrar, which probably means that is a person with medical qualifications. It is a real shame that a judge making a determination on something as important as this, particularly in relation to two charges, which if proved beyond reasonable doubt carry a maximum of life imprisonment, has to guess about these sorts of details but nonetheless, it seems to be that that person is a person with medical qualifications if he or she is properly described as a registrar.
	
	
	For the same reasons that I gave in relation to the documents for the first admission, this is probably also a counselling communication as defined in the Act, according to the very wide definition, although it too is clearly a history given on admission to a hospital for a problem which, as described by the complainant, has no connection with any allegation of sexual assault.
	
	
	There is, however, in my view, nothing in either of those two pages, tabbed by the solicitor for the complainant, which would ever be probative of any of the issues which I have been advised, are considered relevant by counsel for the accused, or for myself, from what I can see from the statements tendered on this application.
	
	
	For those reasons I will not be granting access to those documents.
	
	
	There is another document in relation to this admission which seems to be the fourth yellow tab. It is hard to know how to describe it. It is under a heading which is illegible, but more probably than not is the name of a nurse because the letters PRN appear at the end of the entry. There is an entry dated 25 June 2008 apparently undertaken at the hospital whilst in the Hainsworth ward. It is in the nature of a history given and recorded by that nurse, including the personal history apparently given by the complainant in confidence. There are also observations and impressions of the author recorded.
	
	
	As a nurse in a psychiatric hospital, I am prepared to accept that she is likely to fall within the definition of counsellor. That is by inference only because it is in the absence of any other evidence whatsoever. This then, it seems to me, is capable of being properly described as a counselling communication, although only in its broadest sense. There are portions in this entry, which in my view are probative to issues, which are relevant in this trial, and in particular, in relation to issues of credibility, reliability, accuracy and consistency in relation to the complainant.
	
	
	That is also, in those circumstances, a matter about which I must make a determination under s 299D as to whether or not leave should be granted to access that document.
	
	
	The last yellow tab in relation to this first admission in time appears to be ward notes from 9.30pm on 25 June 2008 to just after midday on 27 June. As far as I can tell they appear to be individual nursing entries. The identity of the nurses cannot be ascertained, but they are all nurses in the psychiatric hospital, so inferentially, likely to fall within the definition of counsellor.
	
	
	Some of them are observations and some of them are records of things apparently said by the complainant. Whether or not they are all counselling communications is far from clear, and more likely than not, in my view, they are not, but I am prepared to accept for the purposes of this argument that they may be.
	
	
	There does not appear to be anything in those notes which fall within the categories identified, following discussions between counsel for the accused and solicitor for the complainant, as being issues of perceived probative value, and even if so, nothing which would ever reach the level of substantive probative value. I will not be granting access to those.
	
	
	In summary, that means that there are two documents in the Cumberland Hospital notes which, following my findings, require determination by me as to whether or not leave should be granted pursuant to s 299D.
	
	
	Before turning to that I will deal with the South Pacific Private Hospital notes in the same way.
	
	
	First of all, in general terms, things that emerge from the records produced by South Pacific Private Hospital is that these documents and records exist at all because the complainant referred herself to this hospital, which is a rehabilitation hospital, for the purposes of completing a 12 Step Program to deal with alcoholism, in the context of being charged with an offence of DUI, having had the matter dealt with in the Local Court, then appealing to the District Court, and in circumstances where she engaged Dr Ben Teo, psychiatrist, to provide a report, and from what I can tell, also provide treatment. The claim on behalf of the complainant here is that is everything produced from this hospital is in fact a counselling communication, that is a communication between the complainant and a counsellor, namely a person who is trained or experienced in counselling a person in relation to harm and providing treatment or advice in relation to that.
	
	
	I find it difficult, as I have said, to accept that such a blanket claim in relation to these or any general hospital file could properly be made. Further, this is not in the same category as, for example, the earlier admission to Cumberland Hospital, a psychiatric hospital, and in circumstances where on the face of those documents they were admissions clearly for harms, as defined in the Act, and she was treated for harm there.
	
	
	“Harm” is defined in the Act as including actual physical bodily harm, financial loss, stress or shock, damage to reputation or emotional or psychological harm. To be a counselling communication it has to be a confidence given to a counsellor in the course of that person's providing counselling in relation to any harm they may have suffered. Some of the entries in the records of this hospital are from intake officers or similar, who are not people, on the evidence before me, with any form of training or experience in counselling, but whose job it is, by inference, to undertake an administrative task in admitting individuals to this hospital to commence alcoholism rehabilitation.
	
	
	Even if that were counselling, and I am far from convinced that it can be, the question remains, is this in fact counselling being given by that person in relation to any harm that the complainant may have suffered as that is defined? I do not accept that that is necessarily the case here, or certainly it is not clearly so.
	
	
	This is a voluntary admission to a rehabilitation hospital by a person who is seeking to achieve abstinence from alcohol use and prevent relapse. Clearly, or at least arguably, conversations with therapists and others during the course of the 12 Step Programs, might well fall into such a category, but I do not accept that what is said to intake assessment officers or triage nurses, or the like, in a situation such as this, falls into the category of counselling communications.
	
	
	In my view it stretches the definition too far. With respect I do not agree with the construction of this section by Berman, DCJ in the Markarian case and am more inclined to accept the view taken by Marien, DCJ in R v Bruce Russell [2013] NSWDC 129.
	
	
	In that case, at para 32, Marien, DCJ looked at the role of those about whom it could not possibly be inferred that they were counsellors, which in that case it was an ambulance officer. In the matter before me, as I have said, they are in the category of administrative intake officers or perhaps triage nurses. It does not seem to be open to infer, in the absence of any evidence, that these people in these roles fall within the definition of counsellor and as such, any document which records conversations between them and the complainant, do not, in my view, become counselling communications which attract privilege.
	
	
	Therefore looking at the documents produced by South Pacific Private Hospital it seems to me there are two sets of documents which fall into that category and to which I will grant access without leave being required because in my view they do not amount to counselling communications. One of those documents is entitled ""Pre-Admission Assessment"", a two-page document apparently created on 8 March 2010 at 1.30pm under the hand of a person whose signature cannot be deciphered but who is referred to as ""an assessing officer"".
	
	
	The second of those documents is a three page double sided document which does not have a heading but which on the bottom is referred to as ""Pre-Admission assessment Form"" and which is handwritten, and which on the face of it appears to form the basis for the typed pre-admission assessment document to which I have already referred.
	
	
	In my view, neither of these documents amounts to counselling communications as defined in the Act and therefore leave is not required for access to these documents. There is material in there which in my view is probative and there has been no claim in any event that a legitimate forensic purpose is not demonstrated for access to these documents and as such I propose to grant access to these documents without the need for leave on the basis of those findings.
	
	
	There is also a clinical discharge summary under the hand of Dr Teo for an admission, which on its face is from 8 October to 26 November 2011, that is, after the 12 Step residential admission. It would appear to relate to day admissions following the earlier residential rehabilitation program.
	
	
	Most of these entries in my view would not qualify as counselling communications given that they include drug charts, observations, and the like. Some of them would amount to counselling communications and some parts of the history recorded may be probative but these histories, and for that matter the material in the discharge summary prepared and signed, or at least signed by Dr Teo for this day program admission appears just to be a repeat of the earlier admission documents, that is, of documents relating to the earlier residential admission and so either because, even though they are not caught by privilege, they are not relevant or because even if they're otherwise potentially probative there is evidence elsewhere, I would not grant access to those documents.
	
	
	Other documents tagged by the complainant’s solicitor in yellow and relating to the September admission to the South Pacific Private Hospital may or may not, in my view, be counselling communications. They include the nursing admission process checklist which itself includes what would either be an irrelevant prescription drug history or, as I have already said, contains information which I am informed is already known to the accused’s counsel or otherwise be irrelevant to the issues identified as probative between counsel for the complainant and the accused’s counsel. It seems to me that except for one document, which I am now about to identify, that is the bulk of the other documents tagged in yellow by the solicitor for the complainant. For those reasons, acknowledging that I do not necessarily purport to make a formal finding as to whether or not they in fact all amount to counselling communications, I will not in any event grant access to them.
	
	
	There remains one document in relation to this admission in September 2010, which does require analysis. It is headed,
	


""Trauma review by primary therapist"".


	
	On the face of it, it appears to have been created as part of the record of progress by the complainant through the 12 Step program. On the face of it, it is prepared by a person described as the primary therapist who elsewhere is named in the file and on the face of it, without further, I am prepared to infer that that person is a counsellor within the definition of the Act.
	
	
	The document itself records information apparently given in confidence by the complainant to the primary therapist about specific harms. That is said to be the whole purpose of this document, namely to record specific traumas, it being a trauma review. For that combination of reasons I accept that it is a counselling communication and as such attracts the privilege. Again just as for the other two documents in the Cumberland Hospital notes I must make a determination under 299D as to whether or not leave ought to be granted.
	
	
	The terms of s 299D are broad:
	


S299D (1) The court cannot grant an application for leave under this Division unless the court is satisfied that:


	
	The document or evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other documents or evidence produced or adduced or to be produced or adduced by the party seeking to produce or adduce the document or evidence, have substantial probative value, and
	
	
	Other documents or evidence concerning the matters to which the protected confidence relates are not available, and
	
	
	The public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the contents of a document of substantial probative value.
	



	
	S299D (1)(c) is probably the most significant part of that section in terms of conducting the necessary balancing exercise.
	
	
	Section 299D(2) sets out matters to be taken into account, which is not meant to be an exhaustive list. I do not propose to read onto the record the provisions of that subsection, but will address them in due course.
	
	
	Section 299D(3) allows for a confidential statement to be made by the protected confider specifying the harm the confider is likely to suffer if the application for leave is granted, to be taken into account by the court in determining the application for leave. No such statement has been tendered on this application.
	
	
	In relation to the three documents to which this consideration applies, namely the two that I have referred to in the Cumberland notes and this document headed ""Trauma review"", I have come to the conclusion that, particularly taken together with other evidence which I accept is likely to be tendered, that these documents have substantial probative value. The substantial probative value goes to the issue which I have described as pivotal to the Crown's case, namely the reliability, accuracy and credibility of the complainant, in relation to which there can be no Crown case unless that is accepted beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	So far as I understand it on the material before me there are no other documents or evidence, which concerns the matters, referred to in these documents, or protected confidences contained in these documents.
	
	
	In my view the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of these protected confidences is outweighed by the substantial probative value of these documents. I accept that there is a public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences. It seems to me that S299D (2) sets out to some extent what that public interest is, namely, to encourage victims of sexual offences to seek counselling, to ensure that that counselling is effective, to ensure that they receive this counselling, to ensure that any relationship between those people and their counsellor is not undermined and to ensure a reasonable expectation of privacy on the part of any such person.
	
	
	I also accept that there is a public interest in protecting a protected confider from any harm that might occur as a result of the disclosure of any protected confidences. I have no evidence before me of any such harm likely to occur to the complainant as a result of these confidences being disclosed.
	
	
	Further, there is in fact, no evidence before me that there is any ongoing counselling involving the complainant in relation to these alleged sexual assaults. One of the matters that I ought take into account in determining the competing public interests is to ensure the viability and effectiveness of any such counselling, with a clear inference that if any such disclosure would undermine that counselling, then it is not in the public interest to do so. In this case there is no evidence that any such counselling is being undertaken or, for that matter, ever has been undertaken.
	
	
	The provisions of S299D (2), in my view, make it quite clear that the purpose of this legislation is, as I have said, that is to protect those who allege sexual assault from intrusion during the course of sexual assault counselling and in the context of criminal proceedings and to ensure that the counselling will be effective and not be undermined.
	
	
	As I have said in my view the material here, in this case, is substantially probative because it is capable of going to the heart of the Crown's case here, namely the credibility, reliability and accuracy of the complainant. It is substantially probative of that in my view because it goes to those very issues, it is not available from any other source and there is no evidence of any harm, either of the type referred to in the section or at all, that might befall the complainant as a result of disclosure nor any evidence indicating a public interest that would outweigh the public interest in ensuring a fair trial for an accused, in particular for serious offences which carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment as to two of them, if there is a conviction.
	
	
	For those reasons I propose to grant access pursuant to s 299D of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986 to three portions of these documents, two that I have identified from the Cumberland Hospital notes and one from the Sydney South Pacific Hospital notes.
	
	
	As I understand it that then deals with all of the documents produced on subpoena and in summary there are five groups of documents, three to which leave has been granted and two in relation to which, on my finding, they do not fall within the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986.

		13 May 2015",2014-06-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764218,R v Hunter (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1146,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1The jury was empanelled at approximately 12 midday today after a problem that arose during arraignment with regard to earlier panels.  That does not require further discussion. 
2Shortly before 2 PM I was handed the following note, which became jury note 1:
""I felt intimidated and scared as I was chosen to be in the jury.  It has all made me feel very emotional as I've had the break to think about it.  I'm not sure how emotional I would get during the actual trial and didn't realise it would effect me like it has.  I would please like to be excused from this jury.""
3In short, the juror has indicated that, even at this early stage, not having heard a skerrick of evidence or indeed the Crown's opening, he or she has become too distressed and too weighed down by his or her responsibility to continue with it comfortably.  Furthermore, he or she has foreshadowed that that situation could become worse.
4The question arises whether the juror should be discharged in accordance with his or her request, pursuant to s 53B of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW). 
5Section 53B of the Jury Act is as follows:
53B   Discretionary discharge of individual juror
The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest, discharge a juror if:
(a)  the juror (though able to discharge the duties of a juror) has, in the judge's or coroner's opinion, become so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers their verdict or has become so ill as to be a health risk to other jurors or persons present at the trial or coronial inquest, or
(b)  it appears to the court or coroner (from the juror's own statements or from evidence before the court or coroner) that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of the juror's familiarity with the witnesses, parties or legal representatives in the trial or coronial inquest, any reasonable apprehension of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the juror or any similar reason, or
(c)  a juror refuses to take part in the jury's deliberations, or
(d)  it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror's ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.
Note. Section 22 provides for the continuation of a trial or inquest on the death or discharge of a juror.
6It can be seen that s 53B(a) speaks of a juror being discharged, or rather a judge having discretion to discharge a juror, if that juror has become so ""incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers their verdict"".
7In more general terms, s 53B(d) speaks in short of it appearing to the Court that, for any other reason that affects the juror's ability to perform his or her functions, the juror should not continue.  
8As I have indicated, this trial for murder has just begun.  Sitting as a judge of the facts on such a count carries with it a heavy, and no doubt emotionally burdensome, responsibility. 
9As the learned Crown Prosecutor foreshadowed to the jury panel, no doubt there will be some evidence that will be of a distressing flavour.  I refer in particular to medical evidence, quite apart from the generally distressing thought that a fellow member of the community died a violent death. 
10It seems that the juror, having had an extended lunch to reflect upon his or her position, simply feels incapable of continuing. 
11Both parties have submitted that the appropriate course is to discharge that juror.  I respectfully accept that joint submission. 
12Accordingly, when the whole jury returns to court I propose to indicate that that juror is discharged.
13I turn to the entirely separate question of whether or not the whole jury should be discharged pursuant to s 53C of the Jury Act: Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; 199 CLR 99.
14Section 53C of the Jury Act is as follows: 
53C   Discretion to continue trial or coronial inquest or discharge whole jury
(1)  If a juror dies, or the court or coroner discharges a juror in the course of a trial or coronial inquest, the court or coroner must:
(a)  discharge the jury if the court or coroner is of the opinion that to continue the trial or coronial inquest with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, or
(b)  if of the opinion that there is no such risk and subject to section 22, order that the trial or coronial inquest continue with a reduced number of jurors.
(2)  A court or coroner that discharges a jury under subsection (1)(a) may stay the proceedings on such terms as the court or coroner thinks fit if a party gives notice of an intention to lodge an application for leave to appeal for review of the decision under section 5G of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
(3)  Where a jury in civil proceedings is discharged under this section, the proceedings may, without any new process for that purpose, be set down for trial either at the same or any subsequent sittings, as the court may order.
15It can be seen that, pursuant to s 53C(1)(a), I must discharge the jury if I am of the opinion that continuing with the remaining jurors ""would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice"".  Section 53C also refers to s 22 of the Jury Act which, as things stand, has no application.
16Both parties have submitted with regard to this entirely separate question that it would be better to discharge the whole jury, and to commence afresh as soon as reasonably practicable with a new panel.
17Again, I respectfully agree with that joint submission.  That is so for a number of reasons.
18First, generally speaking, the accused and the Crown have a right to a verdict of 12 jurors and no fewer.  
19Secondly, the count that the accused is facing is exceptionally serious.  
20Thirdly, in truth, no time will be lost by empanelling a fresh jury as soon as practicable.  
21Fourthly, there will not be a requirement for there to be repetition of evidence that would be logistically disadvantageous to the Court, or personally disadvantageous to any witness.  
22Fifthly, the trial is estimated to take in the vicinity of three weeks.  And yet it has not yet begun.  
23Sixthly, to continue with only 11 jurors permits of less margin for error down the track, if I may express it that way.
24In short, in all of the circumstances that I have outlined, I respectfully accept what the parties have submitted; namely, that to continue with 11 jurors from this very early stage of the trial could give rise to a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.
25In the circumstances, when the jury returns to us, I propose to discharge the whole jury, and thereafter discuss with the parties the logistical way forward.**********

2764221,New South Wales Crime Commission v Tindle [2014] NSWSC 879,"Judgment

1This is an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). Section 10A enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application pending for an unexplained wealth order.

2The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 27 June 2014. In that affidavit, Mr Spark deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity, namely, the supply of prohibited drugs being cannabis contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. That is a serious criminal offence as defined in s 6(2)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.

3The grounds on which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in paragraph four of his affidavit. Mr Spark deposes to having read a statement of facts prepared by Detective Senior Constable Hubert Schwarz of the New South Wales police force. Mr Spark forwarded an email to Senior Constable Schwarz asking him if he drafted the facts sheet, if to the best of his knowledge and belief the facts were true, and if the facts sheets was prepared based on information obtained by police as a result of the investigation set out in the facts sheet. Senior Constable Schwarz answered in an email in the affirmative to all of those questions.

4I am satisfied from having read the facts sheet that the suspicion that Mr Spark holds is reasonably held by him. Section 10(5) of the Act requires an order to be made if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion.

5I am satisfied also that the defendant is domiciled in New South Wales, and that the property in respect of which the order is sought is situated in New South Wales.

6Section 10A(4) enables notice to be given to the defendant of this application if the court thinks fit. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence, based on his long experience in the area, concerning the speed with which property can be transferred and disposed of, I do not consider that it is appropriate to give the Defendant notice of this application in advance.

7The Defendant has rights of review under s 10C of the ability.

8On the plaintiff through its solicitor giving the usual undertaking as to damages, and I note that it has been given by Ms Goh, and having regard to the matters in Mr Spark's affidavit, I make the orders in paragraphs one, two, three, five, seven, and eight of the draft order, and I grant the leave and liberty contained in paras four and six.

		03 July 2014",2014-06-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764225,"Esterman v Commissioner of Police, NSW Police Force [2014] NSWCATOD 70","reasons for decision

1The applicant, Mr Mark Esterman, has previously been the holder of a Class 1AC security licence. 

2Following an incident on 26 April 2012 when he was working as a security guard at The Old Manly Boatshed, Mr Esterman was charged with common assault, affray and behave in offensive manner in or near a public place or school. The incidents giving rise to the charges were captured on CCTV footage, which was tendered in court as evidence against Mr Esterman and is also before the Tribunal in the current proceedings.

3As a result of being charged for these offences while performing security activities, Mr Esterman's security licence was revoked on 28 June 2012.

4On 3 July 2013, Mr Esterman appeared in the Local Court in relation to the charges against him. The alleged victim of the assault, Mr Mark Smith, did not attend the proceedings despite attempts made to find him. It is common ground that the assault charges were based on two kicks to Mr Smith by Mr Esterman, following aggression by Mr Smith towards a second security guard, Mr Harker. The first kick was to Mr Smith's leg and the second, while Mr Smith was on the ground on his hands and knees, to his torso. The question for the magistrate was whether, on each of these two occasions, Mr Esterman kicked Mr Smith in defence of Mr Harker and whether it could properly be said that Mr Esterman believed on reasonable grounds that his actions were necessary. 

5In dismissing all charges against Mr Esterman, the magistrate found the first kick by Mr Esterman to have been justified in the situation in order to enable Mr Esterman to defend Mr Harker. In relation to the second kick, which Mr Esterman said he had made in the belief that Mr Smith was attempting to get up again and may have been carrying a weapon, the magistrate stated:
The question is whether or not the second kick was again disproportionate to the threat as he perceived it. He says that Smith was getting up and indeed the video does not contradict that or merely confirm it. He was just on his hands and knees and he could well have been getting up. If he were to do so, it is at least possible and reasonably possible that he would continue with the physical aggression which he had shown against Harker. Again the difficulty that I am having with this is indicative that I do have a reasonable doubt as to whether the second kick was proportionate in the circumstances and I dismiss the charge. 

6On 10 July 2013, Mr Esterman applied for a Class 1AC security licence and on 22 October 2013, the Commissioner made a decision to refuse his application based on the incident which had taken place on 26 April 2012. This decision was affirmed following an internal review on 4 November 2013.

7In reaching this decision, the Commissioner found that the CCTV footage of the incident showed Mr Esterman acting in an overly aggressive manner towards Mr Smith, thereby raising serious concerns as to Mr Esterman's suitability to be granted a security licence. On this basis, the Commissioner found that Mr Esterman was not a fit and proper person to hold a security licence. The Commissioner also found that, at that point in time, it was not in the public interest for Mr Esterman to be granted a security licence. The Commissioner relied on the decision of Bazouni & Ors v Commissioner of Police, New South Wales Police Services [2002] NSWADT 100 to find that in considering the public interest, it is the person's conduct, not the fact of a conviction, which is to be considered. 

Review decision
8On 11 December 2014, Mr Esterman lodged an application for review of this decision to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal. On 1 January 2014 the jurisdiction of that tribunal was taken over by the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT). As the proceedings are 'pending proceedings', the provisions of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997 (NSW) (ADT Act) continue to apply: Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 (NSW), Sch 1, cl 6 and 7.

9The Tribunal's task is to determine whether the decision to refuse Mr Esterman's licence is the 'correct and preferable' decision based on the all the material then before it and any applicable written or unwritten law: ADT Act, s 63. That means that the Tribunal is to take into account all the evidence, not just the evidence on which the Commissioner based his decision. The Tribunal may affirm, vary or set aside the Commissioner's decision to refuse to grant a security licence to Mr Esterman.

10The Security Industry Act 1997 provides for the granting of security licences. 

11Within the Act, there are clearly defined circumstances where the Commissioner may refuse to grant an application for a licence. Section 15 of the Act relevantly provides:
(1) The Commissioner must refuse to grant an application for a licence if the Commissioner is not satisfied that the applicant:
(a) is a fit and proper person to hold the class of licence sought by the applicant, or
...
(3) The Commissioner may refuse to grant an application for a licence if the Commissioner considers that the grant of the licence would be contrary to the public interest.

12The issue before the Tribunal is 
(1)whether Mr Esterman is a fit and proper person to hold a security licence; and 

(2)whether the grant of the licence would be contrary to the public interest.

Fit and proper
13In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33; (1990) 170 CLR 321, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said at 380:
The expression ""fit and proper person"", standing alone, carries no precise meaning. It takes its meaning from its context, from the activities in which the person is or will be engaged and the ends to be served by those activities. The concept of ""fit and proper"" cannot be entirely divorced from the conduct of the person who is or will be engaging in those activities. However, depending on the nature of the activities, the question may be whether improper conduct has occurred, whether it is likely to occur, whether it can be assumed that it will not occur, or whether the general community will have confidence that it will not occur. The list is not exhaustive but it does indicate that, in certain contexts, character (because it provides indication of likely future conduct) or reputation (because it provides indication of public perception as to likely future conduct) may be sufficient to ground a finding that a person is not fit and proper to undertake the activities in question.

14In Sobey v Commercial Agents Board [1979] 22 SASR 70 Walters J said at 76:
In my opinion, what is meant by [the expression fit and proper] is that an applicant must show not only that he is possessed of a requisite knowledge of the duties and responsibilities devolving upon him as the holder of the particular licence under the Act, but also that he is possessed of sufficient moral integrity and rectitude of character as to permit him to be safely accredited to the public, without further inquiry, as a person to be entrusted with the sort of work which the licence entails.

15A person's fitness is to be considered in the light of the activities that the person will undertake. Fitness with respect to an office is said to involve honesty, knowledge and ability: see Hughes and Vale Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No.2) [1955] HCA 28; (1955) 93 CLR 127 at 156 - 7.

Public interest

16The Courts and the Tribunal have held that the concept of the 'public interest' is designed to give the broader interests of the community priority over private interests. In Comalco Aluminium (Bell Bay) Ltd v O'Connor and Others (1995) 131 ALR 657, Wilox CJ and Keely J said at 681:
The purpose of the reference to public interest is to ensure that private interests are not only matters taken into account: to make clear that the interests of the whole community are matters for the Commissioner's consideration. The effect of the reference is to amplify the 'scope and purpose' of the legislation.

17In Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith [1991] VicRp 6; (1991) 1 VR 63 the Court held:
The public interest is a term embracing matters, among others, of standards of human conduct and of the functioning of government and government instrumentalities tacitly accepted and acknowledged to be for the good order of society and for the well being of its members. The interest is therefore the interest of the public as distinct from the interest of an individual or individuals.

18In Commissioner of Police v Toleafoa [1999] NSWADTAP 9 at [25] the Tribunal's Appeal Panel said:
The ""public interest"" is an inherently broad concept giving the appellant the ability to have regard to a wide range of factors in choosing whether to exercise a discretion adversely to an individual.

19The Tribunal has also found that an applicant's personal interest in retaining his or her licence cannot outweigh the public interest in having full confidence in the professionalism of people involved in the security industry (Blissett v Commissioner of Police, New South Wales Police; Webb Protection Australia Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Police, New South Wales Police [2006] NSWADT 114 at [32]).

20In Constantin v Commissioner of Police, NSW Police Force (GD) [2013] NSWADTAP 16 at [33] the Appeal Panel held:
The 'public interest' allows, we consider, for issues going beyond the character of the applicant to be taken into account. These may include concerns in relation to public protection, public safety and public confidence in the administration of the licensing system.

CONSIDERATION OF EVIDENCE
21The Tribunal held a hearing in this matter on 26 February 2014. At the conclusion of the hearing, the parties were granted time to provide further written material to the Tribunal.

22The following material is before the Tribunal in relation to Mr Esterman's achievement in the security industry: 

Certificate II in Security Operations dated 23 January 2009;


Statement of Attainment dated 14/10/10 in relation to the fulfilment of the requirements to apply first aid, provide basic emergency life support and perform CPR;


Statement of Attainment dated 19/2/04 following the completion of 11 units of competency in security guarding.

23In support of his application for review, Mr Esterman has provided a reference from Mr Chaz A Tanner, Director of Group Operations at Group Services Australia Pty Ltd. Mr Tanner states that Mr Esterman has been employed by the company since 2008 and offers to re-employ Mr Esterman were his security licence to be reinstated.

24Mr Tanner describes Mr Esterman as follows:
Mr Esterman has been a very reliable and courteous employee, carrying out all his duties with the upmost courtesy and professionalism. When working at various licensed premises, Mr Esterman always adhered to our company's work place policy (total hands off) and we have never had any issues or incidents with Mr Esterman, regarding our work place policy at any licensed premises.

25In evidence before the Tribunal, Mr Esterman agreed that he had been on duty at The Old Manly Boat Shed on 26 April 2012 and that, as a result of an incident involving Mr Mark Smith, had delivered two kicks to Mr Smith's body. His first kick had been to Mr Smith's calf, in order to get him to the ground, and his second kick had been to his torso. Mr Esterman told the Tribunal that he knew Mr Smith was a former police officer and that he had information that Mr Smith might have been carrying a concealed weapon. Mr Esterman told the Tribunal that, in the circumstances, he believed his use of force to have been appropriate, and that his second kick had been to enable him to arrest Mr Smith. 

26Mr Harker, a security guard who had been on duty with Mr Esterman at the Manly Boat Shed on 26 April 2012, was also charged with assault that night. Following the dismissal of these charges in the Local Court, Mr Harker has since been granted a security licence. 

27In explaining the Commissioner's decisions to refuse Mr Esterman a security licence despite having granted a licence to Mr Harker, Mr Zoppo, for the respondent, advised that: 
The conduct of Mr Harker involved Mr Smith being thrown to the ground whereas [Mr Esterman's] conduct involved a kick to the abdomen with a great degree of force applied to a person who was on his hands and knees and who was posing no threat to [Mr Esterman] or any other person at the time. The kick was, in the Commissioner's view directed at harming Mr Smith for no justifiable reason and more serious in the circumstances.

28The Tribunal accepts Mr Esterman's evidence that Mr Smith had been aggressive in his behaviour and that it was only after Mr Smith had lunged at Mr Harker, that Mr Esterman had delivered his first kick, to Mr Smith's leg. 

29Having viewed the CCTV footage at hearing with the applicant and Mr Zoppo, however, the Tribunal agrees with the views of the Commissioner that when Mr Esterman had kicked Mr Smith a second time, this time directing the kick to his torso, Mr Smith had been on the ground and was posing no threat to any other person. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that Mr Smith was in any way armed at the time and the Tribunal finds that, in the circumstances, the second kick by Mr Esterman was excessive. 

30The Tribunal accepts that the charges made against Mr Esterman following the altercation were subsequently dismissed by the Local Court. However, the Tribunal's role is different to that of a court: it is not the Tribunal's role to consider whether Mr Esterman's actions amounted to criminal behaviour, rather how they are to be seen when considering whether Mr Esterman is a fit and proper person to hold a security licence and whether it would be in the public interest for him to do so. It is, for these reasons, the conduct rather than the conviction that is of concern to the Tribunal. Bazouni & Ors v Commissioner of Police, NSW Police Service [2002] NSWADT 100

31With this in mind, the Tribunal finds that Mr Esterman's conduct in delivering this second kick to Mr Smith was, in the circumstances, both unnecessary and unacceptable. It is the type of behaviour that may lessen public confidence in the professionalism of the security industry, which has a special role in ensuring that public order is maintained and that the public and public venues are safe. 

32For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that, at this stage, it would not be in the public interest for Mr Esterman to be granted a security licence. On this basis, the Tribunal is satisfied that the decision of the Commissioner to refuse to grant Mr Esterman a security licence should be affirmed. 

33As the Tribunal has found that it would not be in the public interest for Mr Esterman to be granted a security licence at this stage and accordingly that the decision to refuse to grant him a security licence should be affirmed, the Tribunal has not proceeded to consider the additional ground as to whether or not he is a fit and proper person to hold such a licence.

34The Tribunal notes that the Commissioner would be prepared to favourably consider a further application for a security licence from Mr Esterman if he can:

provide to the Commissioner a letter from a prospective employer confirming an offer of work; and


show to the Commissioner that for a period of 12 months from this decision he has been able to remain of good behaviour without any adverse matters; or 


show to the Commissioner that for a period of 6 months from this decision he has been able to remain of good behaviour without any further adverse matters and has undertaken a further course of learning, demonstrating competence in the subject: Manage conflict through negotiation. 

Findings
35On the evidence before it, and for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds that, at this stage, it would not be in the public interest for Mr Esterman to hold a security licence. On this basis, it is the Tribunal's view that the correct and preferable decision is that Mr Esterman should not be permitted to hold a security licence at this time. It follows that the decision of the Commissioner should be affirmed.

Recommendation
36The Tribunal recommends to the Commissioner that if Mr Esterman should re-apply for a security licence then the licence should be granted provided that:

he can provide to the Commissioner a letter from a prospective employer confirming an offer of work; and


he can show to the Commissioner that for a period of 12 months from this decision he has been able to remain of good behaviour without any adverse matters; or that for a period of 6 months from this decision he is able to show that he has been able to remain of good behaviour without any further adverse matters and has undertaken a further course of learning, demonstrating competence to the Commissioner in the subject: Manage conflict through negotiation.

		30 June 2014",2014-06-29 00:00:00,NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal
2764238,Pratten v R [2014] NSWCCA 117,"JUDGMENT


	
	THE COURT: On 13 June 2012 the appellant was found guilty of seven counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to subsection 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). That subsection provides:
	


“A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a)   the person, by a deception, dishonestly obtains a financial advantage from another person; and

(b)   the other person is a Commonwealth entity.”


	
	This is an appeal by the appellant against his conviction and by the Crown from the sentences imposed with respect to those convictions.
	
	
	Those offences related to the lodging of tax returns for each of the financial years ending 30 June 2003 through to 30 June 2009. The returns for the years ending 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2004 were lodged on 18 August 2005. The return for 30 June 2005 was lodged on 21 January 2006. The returns for the years ending 30 June 2006 to 30 June 2009 were lodged on 28 September 2009. On the filing of each of those returns the appellant was deemed to have received a notice of assessment of tax based on the taxable income disclosed in the return.
	
	
	The Crown’s case was that for each of those financial years, the appellant knowingly understated his ordinary assessable income thereby avoiding becoming liable at the time those returns were lodged to pay higher amounts of tax. The understated income for each of the relevant financial years, as contended by the Crown, was as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Count - FY
			
			
			Understated income
			
		
		
			
			1 - 2003
			
			
			1,068,706

			275,367

			134,168
			
		
		
			
			Total:
			
			
			$5,009,721
			
		
	



	
	The counts were in the same form. Count 1 charged:
	


“      TIMOTHY CHARLES PRATTEN

Between about 17 August 2005 and 27 August 2005 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did, by a deception, dishonestly obtain a financial advantage from the Commonwealth, by causing to be lodged with the Australian Taxation Office his personal income tax return for the financial year ended 30 June 2003 in which he failed to disclose all income derived by him during the financial year ending 30 June 2003.”


	
	In each of the seven tax years payments were made into the appellant’s personal bank account, or at his direction to third parties, from trust accounts controlled by two Vanuatu accounting firms. Those were accounts of Vanuatu International Trust Co (VITCO) and International Finance Trust Company Ltd (IFTCO). Those payments were referred to in the trial as the “disputed payments”, the dispute being whether they were income derived by the appellant and believed by him to be income.
	
	
	A significant question in the conviction and sentencing appeals is whether in order to convict the appellant on each count the jury could have understood that they did not need to be satisfied that each and every disputed amount received or paid in that year was, and was believed by the appellant to be, income. The jury were not directed that they did not need to be so satisfied or that if they were not so satisfied they could convict the appellant provided that they were satisfied unanimously that a particular amount or amounts constituted income which was knowingly not disclosed. Nor was the jury directed that if they were not satisfied that all of the disputed payments in any particular year were income, they must find the appellant not guilty of the count for that year.
	
	
	Neither the Crown nor the defence asked the trial judge to give any specific direction in relation to these matters. Because the offences charged were against a law of the Commonwealth, the following direction was given as to the need for unanimity as to any verdict:
	


“39.   Under the system of law that applies to Commonwealth offences with which you are dealing, your verdict, whether it be guilty or not guilt, must be unanimous. That does not mean each one of you must agree on the same reasons for your verdict. You may or may not. You may place a different emphasis on different parts of the evidence or even on different aspects of the way in which the matter has been argued.

40.   Whatever paths you take to come to the ultimate conclusion, the final decision of either guilty or not guilty in relation to each charge must be the decision of all you unanimously before it can become your verdict.”


	
	The appellant argues that having regard to the way in which the trial was conducted and the summing up, the jury are likely to have understood (correctly) that they did not need to be satisfied that all of the disputed payments in any year were income in order to convict of the charge for that year. This gave rise to a risk that individual jurors may have concluded that the appellant was guilty on the basis of the knowing non-declaration for that year of different amounts of income. That being so, a direction should have been given which made clear that in order to convict of the charge for any year the jury had to be unanimous in their findings as to the particular amount or amounts of income which were knowingly not declared and the subject of the financial advantage obtained. In the absence of such a direction, it was contended that the appellant had not had a trial in which the elements of the offence had been explained correctly to the jury (see Mraz v The Queen (No 1) [1955] HCA 59; 93 CLR 493 at 514 (Fullagar J)).
	
	
	The Crown makes two responses to this argument. First, it says that in the way the trial judge summed up, the jury must have understood that the Crown case was an “all or nothing case” in the sense that it was necessary for the jury to convict of any count that it find beyond reasonable doubt that in the relevant year all of the disputed amounts were income which was knowingly not disclosed. Secondly, the Crown submitted that the elements of the offences charged, correctly identified by the judge in his written directions, allowed the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there had been a financial benefit dishonestly obtained by an intentional deception without having to agree unanimously that particular income had been knowingly not declared. It was said that there were different pathways by which the jurors could conclude that the appellant engaged in an intentional deception and dishonestly obtained a financial advantage. Those pathways did not require that the jury be unanimous as to particular amounts or payments being income which was not disclosed.
	
	
	The jury returned their verdicts on 13 June 2012. The sentencing proceedings were heard on 28 March 2013. That hearing was delayed, in part, because in September 2012 the appellant brought proceedings making a collateral attack upon the prosecution of the criminal proceedings and the convictions. Prerogative relief was sought in relation to the conduct of various parties in connection with the investigation and prosecution of the criminal proceedings. That application was dismissed by the trial judge in a judgment delivered on 21 May 2013: Pratten v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] NSWSC 594.
	
	
	At the commencement of argument on the sentencing hearing, senior counsel for the Crown, who had not appeared at the trial, made the following submissions (3/859-860):
	


“… it is implicit in the jury’s verdict that the jury must have found beyond reasonable doubt at least the following: That is, that in each of the years relevant to the charges, that is, each of the tax years, some or all of the - I think what your Honour referred to in your Honour’s directions and summing up as; the disputed amounts’, that is, the amounts paid by ITFCO and VITCO to the offender or at his direction so that in each of the years some or all of the disputed amounts were the offender’s income. Now I have used the expression there ‘some or all’ and I will come back to that in a moment.

… now - and this is really the critical factual issue in the sentence proceedings - the Crown accepts that it cannot necessarily be concluded having regard to the way that the matter went to the jury that the jury necessarily found beyond reasonable doubt that all of the disputed amounts comprised the offender’s income. We say, of course, that the jury most likely did, having regard to the evidence, accept that it was income and the jury must have rejected the various arguments that were put forward on the offender’s behalf as to why it was not income and I will come back to that in due course but the Crown accepts that it cannot be accepted as necessarily implicit in the convictions that all of the disputed amounts were his income.” (emphasis added).


	
	In the appellant’s written submissions on sentence, it was accepted that the Crown case “was not all-or-nothing” (3/956). Accordingly, consistently with the jury’s verdict being understood on that basis, the sentencing judge made findings as to the disputed payments which the jury by its verdicts was to be taken to have found were income knowingly not declared in each of the relevant years, giving the appellant in that exercise the benefit of any reasonable doubt: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 378; Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; 209 CLR 1 at [14], [169].
	
	
	The sentencing judgment was delivered on 31 March 2014: R v Pratten [2014] NSWSC 396. The sentencing judge concluded at [39] that the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that all of the disputed payments in each of the seven financial years were income. His Honour held that the Crown had not established beyond reasonable doubt that the third party payments were income of the appellant. He concluded that over the seven years a total amount of $2,774,658 was undeclared income resulting in a financial advantage to the appellant represented by the tax that was not assessed as due and payable on that undeclared income: [2014] NSWSC 396 at [40].
	
	
	The following sentences were imposed in relation to each of the counts:
	


Count      Sentence imposed

Counts 1-2   Community Service Order of 500 hours.

Count 3   Community Service Order of 250 hours to be served concurrently with the above 500 hours.

Counts 4-7      •   Sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months backdated to commence on 31 March 2013 by reason of the offender being on conditional bail.

•   Ordered to be released 18 months from the backdated commencement date of 31 March 2013 (which will be on 29 September 2014) upon entering into a recognizance release order in the sum of $1000 to be of good behaviour for 24 months.

•   Period in custody of 6 months (31 March to 29 September 2014).


	
	The Crown’s position as to whether its case before the jury was an all or nothing, as distinct from some or all, case emerged during the argument of the appeal. In its written submissions in the sentencing appeal the Crown contended that it followed by implication from the jury’s verdict that they had found that the source of all payments, direct and third party, was a company incorporated in Vanuatu, Commercial Pacific Insurance Ltd (CPI), in which the appellant held an interest as owner, and that they had also found that at least some of the payments to the appellant were either remuneration for services or the distribution of profits. The Crown accepted, however, that it could not necessarily be concluded that the jury had found beyond reasonable doubt that all of the disputed payments were income. By reference to the evidence before the sentencing judge, the Crown submitted that he erred in finding that there was any reasonable doubt as to the third party payments being income knowingly not disclosed. In its oral submissions, and partly in response to the appellant’s argument as to the need for a unanimity direction, the Crown argued that the case which the trial judge by his summing up left for the jury was that to convict they had to be satisfied that all of the disputed amounts were income knowingly not disclosed.
	


The appeals against conviction and sentence


	
	The appellant appeals against his convictions pursuant to s 5(1)(a) and also seeks leave to appeal against those convictions pursuant to s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Six grounds of appeal (grounds 1A, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8) are pressed. Each of those grounds is set out below in the part of this judgment that specifically deals with it. The grounds include ground 1A which alleges error in failing to give a specific unanimity direction. It is said that error involved a fundamental irregularity in the conduct of the trial which resulted in the appellant being deprived of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open. It is also contended by ground 7 that each of the verdicts was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth appeals against the sentences pursuant to s 5D(1). There are 26 grounds of appeal relied upon. They include that the sentencing judge made factual errors in relation to the amount of the undeclared income and the dishonest means adopted by the appellant. It is also contended that the sentences for each of the counts were manifestly inadequate, and that the totality of the sentences, and the non-parole period, were manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, we have concluded that ground 1A must be upheld, the convictions set aside and a new trial ordered. Each of the other grounds of appeal is rejected as a separate basis for setting aside the convictions. This conclusion means that there is no need to deal with the Crown’s sentencing appeal.
	
	
	Before addressing the grounds of appeal in relation to the convictions it is necessary first to say something about the circumstances in which the alleged offending was shown by the evidence to have occurred. It will be necessary also to consider the way in which the issues raised by the charges were left for the determination of the jury. We do that in the context of dealing with ground 1A.
	


Background facts


	
	Before August 2002 the appellant was a director of and, indirectly, a shareholder in an Australian insurer, Rural & General Insurance Ltd (RGIL) which insured small commercial business risks. From July 2002, due to a change in the prudential and licensing requirements for Australian insurers, RGIL ceased to underwrite new business and went into run-off (meaning that it continued in business but only to deal with claims and losses arising under insurance policies which it had issued before 1 July 2002). In August 2002 Rural & General International Insurance Ltd (RGII), which in March 2003 changed its name to CPI, was incorporated by BDO Barrett Partners (BDO Vanuatu), a Vanuatu based accounting firm. The principals or employees of that firm included Lindsay Barrett and Adrian Sinclair. The appellant described the latter as a “very good friend and business colleague” (6/166).
	
	
	At the same time the appellant became a director of Rural & General Insurance Broking Ltd (RGIB), which then commenced to place commercial small business insurance with RGII/CPI from 20 August 2002 (1/184). Mr Aaron Stephenson was also a director RGIB. (He did not give evidence at the trial and it was not part of the Crown case that he was involved in any of the alleged offending). By an agency agreement made at about this time between RGIB and CPI, the latter authorised RGIB to issue cover notes and insurance contracts on its behalf (1/237). Under that agreement RGIB was entitled to a commission equal to 33 per cent of net premium income (1/279). The risks insured by CPI were reinsured and from December 2005 that reinsurance was placed through a London broker, Alsford Paige & Gemes Ltd (2/579). Don Cantwell was a broker with that company who gave evidence at the trial. He first met the appellant in 2005. The appellant told him that CPI was set up to take over the business of RGIB (9/739-740) and that he had (at least) “an interest in” CPI (9/740,790-791).
	
	
	Up to June 2004 RGIB remitted premiums received for policies issued on behalf of RGII/CPI to a trust account of VITCO, a company controlled and administered by BDO Vanuatu. After June 2004, those premiums were remitted to an account of IFTCO, which was controlled and administered by another Vanuatu accounting firm, PKF Vanuatu. At the same time two companies associated with that firm, Astrolabe Ltd and Astrolabe Nominees Ltd were appointed as the directors of CPI (2/692). The principals or employees of PKF Vanuatu included Robert Agius, Iain Johns and Kelly Fawcett.
	
	
	In each of the financial years ending 30 June 2002 to 30 June 2009 substantial payments were made out of the VITCO and later IFTCO accounts. Some of those payments (totalling $2,913,008 over the seven year period) were made directly into a personal bank account of the appellant conducted with the St George Bank in Sydney. The remaining payments (totalling $2,096,725 over the same period) were made to third parties and applied either in the acquisition of assets in the names of those parties or in the payment of moneys owing to them by the appellant. The evidence as to these receipts and payments was given by Ms Celona, a forensic accountant, who prepared an analysis of the VITCO and IFTCO transfers and of payments into and out of the appellant’s St George Bank account. The assets acquired were a Robinson R44 helicopter, a motor vessel named “Los Lobos”, four properties, a business at Stroud (a small country town north of Newcastle in New South Wales) and a Mitsubishi truck. The expenses were the school fees of the appellant’s two daughters, rent on a Darling Point property in Sydney, which was occupied by the appellant, and architectural fees for a proposed residence at Port Vila in Vanuatu.
	
	
	Each of the assets was purchased in the name of an entity other than the appellant. The helicopter was purchased in the name of Sonarpia Pty Ltd as trustee of the Pratten Family Trust using funds which were said by the appellant to have been lent to him by CPI (11/106). The appellant and his daughters were named as primary beneficiaries of that discretionary trust which was formed in May 2003 (2/558, 576). In 1998 the motor vessel was owned by Trop Sun Pty Ltd (6/81), a company controlled by the appellant. That company was later renamed 71 Cowper Street Holdings Pty Ltd (71 Cowper St) (6/394). It also held a 66 per cent shareholding interest in RGIB (2/513). In November 1999, the appellant and Global Nominees Ltd, a BDO Vanuatu nominee company, became registered as owners or operators of the vessel (6/80). That remained the position in 2003. In March 2005 IFTCO asserted that the owner of the vessel was Astrolabe Services Ltd, another company associated with PKF Vanuatu (6/86). In May 2011 the appellant asserted that he was the beneficial owner of the vessel (6/103).
	
	
	Three real property assets, “Skallet” at Tereel Road, Ward’s River (a grazing property), the Macedo Block (a 50 acre block adjoining “Skallet”) at Tereel Road, Ward’s River and what was referred to as the Stroud Development Block (at Mill Creek Road, Stroud), were purchased in the name of Pacific Property Investments Ltd (PPI), a Vanuatu incorporated company (6/516, 517). Before June 2004 the sole director of PPI was Global Nominees Ltd (6/523), a BDO Vanuatu nominee company. From July 2004 PPI was “administered” by PKF Vanuatu (6/531-534) and its directors were Astrolabe Ltd and Astrolabe Nominees Ltd (6/346, 538, 539). The appellant was aware of and involved in the move of his, PPI’s and CPI’s affairs from BDO Vanuatu to PKF Vanuatu. For example, on 20 June 2004 he sent an email to Iain Johns attaching a communication received from Lindsay Barrett regarding PPI’s purchase of the Stroud Development Block which was proceeding at that time. The appellant said “I will talk to you later about how things work” (6/539A). The shareholders in PPI as at January 2006 were two Vanuatu incorporated companies, Garde Ltd and Tenir Ltd (6/549-550).
	
	
	At some stage the appellant commenced a cattle farming business on the “Skallet” property. That business was named Myidaho or Myidaho Natural Beef. In September 2008 the appellant, in a finance application in relation to that business (5/39), said that he was “just starting to operate my farm enterprise as a business unit thus, I do not expect any income until later in this financial year” (5/36). Financial statements for that business prepared in September 2009 included expenses of $27,399 (2005) and $41,510 (2006). The Stroud Hardware Store business and property, and a cattle truck, were purchased in the name of 71 Cowper St. At least two of the three issued shares in that company were held by the appellant (2/513, 6/392). The evidence was that the $222,000 transferred from VITCO for the purchase of that property and business was secured by a mortgage given by 71 Cowper St in favour of PPI (wrongly described in the mortgage as Pacific Properties Pty Ltd) (6/420, 422).
	
	
	The third party payments relating to particular properties, assets or expenses were spread over more than one tax year. For example, payments were made in relation to the helicopter in the financial years ending 2005, 2006 and 2008 and payments were made in relation to the “Skallet” property in the financial years ended 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Details of those direct and third party payments are shown in the table attached to this judgment as Schedule 1.
	
	
	The appellant’s tax returns for the years ending 30 June 2003 to 30 June 2005 were prepared by John Greer of Griffiths Forrest & Greer, accountants. The returns for the following years were prepared by Stuart Berry and Megan Hamberger of Addison Partners Pty Ltd. (It was not part of the Crown case that either of these accounting firms or any of these persons was knowingly involved in any of the alleged offending.)
	


Conviction appeal: Ground 1A

Introduction


	
	Ground 1A is:
	


“The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that, in respect of each count on the indictment, they must be unanimous with respect to any particular financial advantage dishonestly obtained by the appellant by deception.”


	
	The present case is not one that is said to involve duplicitous counts or in which the Crown led evidence of multiple offences which answer the description of the offences charged: as to which see the discussion in S v The Queen [1989] HCA 66; 168 CLR 266 at 284-286 (Gaudron and McHugh JJ), Walsh v R [2002] VSCA 98 at [39]-[43] (Phillips and Buchanan JJA, Ormiston JA agreeing) and Hannes v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 373 at [4]-[17], [89] (per Basten JA).
	
	
	For each count the deception was alleged to be constituted by the appellant representing, by the lodging of the return, that the amount of income declared constituted the whole of his ordinary income for that financial year. The Crown sought to establish the fact of that intentional deception by the existence of the “disputed” payments which were said to constitute income that was knowingly not declared as income, resulting in the appellant dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage. That advantage was being assessed liable to pay an amount of tax less than the amount that would have been assessed had the non-disclosed income been declared.
	
	
	The appellant says that for the jury to convict in respect of any particular count it had to be satisfied that at least one of the disputed amounts constituted income which he had dishonestly failed to declare in a tax return. If the jury was satisfied that a particular amount was knowingly not disclosed as income, it could be satisfied that there had been an intentional deception and that he had obtained a financial advantage by that deception. It followed, the appellant argued, that although the Crown relied upon the knowing non-disclosure of a number of payments to prove the elements of the offence the proof of the knowing non-disclosure of any one of those payment in a particular year entitled the jury to convict on the count for that year. Because it was open on the evidence for individual jurors to be satisfied that different disputed amounts were income, it was necessary that a direction be given that if they were not agreed that a particular amount was income knowingly not disclosed, they should put that amount out of consideration when addressing whether there was an intentional deception which resulted in a financial advantage dishonestly obtained.
	
	
	In response, the Crown made the two submissions referred to above at [10]. First, it was not necessary that the jury agree as to the disputed amounts that were the subject of the intentional deception and which resulted in a financial advantage. Secondly, it did not matter in this case that it may have been open to the jury on the evidence to come to different conclusions as to whether particular payments were income because the Crown case was left to the jury by the trial judge on the basis that to convict on any count they had to find that all of the disputed amounts for that year constituted income of the appellant.
	
	
	These arguments make it necessary to consider the circumstances in which a specific unanimity direction may be required, the elements of the offence charged in this case, the evidence relied upon by the Crown to prove these elements (and the evidence upon which the appellant relied to raise a doubt as to guilt) and the issues identified by the trial judge for the jury to decide.
	


The circumstances in which a unanimity direction is or may be required


	
	As Phillips and Buchanan JJA observed at [43] in Walsh, the question of “unanimity can arise when only one offence is charged and only one offence is proved but the jury is presented through the evidence led with more than one route to determine guilt”. In such a case the question is whether the jury must be directed to be unanimous, not only in the verdict, but also in the route by which that verdict is reached. An understanding of the circumstances in which such a direction is required is assisted by a review of some of the intermediate appellate Court decisions which have addressed it.
	
	
	In R v Brown (1984) 79 Cr App R 115 the offence charged was that the accused fraudulently induced four persons to enter into agreements to acquire shares in a company by making misleading statements. In relation to each of the four counts the prosecution relied on the making of at least four different statements as constituting the fraudulent inducement.
	
	
	The jury asked the judge two questions which were dealt with in the summing up. The second question was whether “If the individual members of the jury find him guilty of different parts of the count, is he guilty on the whole count, and is the verdict of guilty unanimous?” In answering that question, the trial judge said:
	


“It does not matter that some of you are satisfied that one of the various statements is made out, and others of you are satisfied not about that statement being made out but that another is made out. It is sufficient if you are all agreed that there was a dishonest inducement. So if you find some of you are satisfied that representation A was made out, some of you are not satisfied about that but are satisfied that representation B was made out, then it does not matter, provided that you are all satisfied that there was the dishonest inducement made and that it operated upon the mind of the person to whom it was made and caused him to act in the way that he did.”


	
	The English Court of Appeal (Eveleigh LJ, Robert Goff LJ and Hollings J) upheld the accused’s argument that in answering that question the judge misdirected the jury. Eveleigh LJ, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at 117:
	


“Counsel for the appellant was correct in his submission that it is a fundamental principle that in arriving at their verdict the jury must be agreed that every single ingredient necessary to constitute the offence has been established. The false statement is an essential ingredient.”

and at 119:

“In a case such as that with which we are now dealing, the following principles apply: 1. Each ingredient of the offence must be proved to the satisfaction of each and every member of the jury (subject to the majority direction). 2. However, where a number of matters are specified in the charge as together constituting one ingredient in the offence, and any one of them is capable of doing so, then it is enough to establish the ingredient that any one of them is proved; but (because of the first principle above) any such matter must be proved to the satisfaction of the whole jury. The jury should be directed accordingly, and it should be made clear to them as well that they should all be satisfied that the statement upon which they are agreed was an inducement as alleged.”

This statement was referred to with approval by Lord Ackner in the decision of the House of Lords in R v More [1987] 1 WLR 1578 at 1583-1584.


	
	In the present case each of the payments made to the appellant or to third parties is said to constitute income which was knowingly not disclosed thereby resulting in the appellant’s obtaining a financial benefit. Whilst those payments are not particularised in the indictment it is the existence of any such amount of income and the appellant’s knowledge or belief that it was not disclosed that establishes the intentional deception and, by the deemed issue of an assessment notice that does not take it into account, the dishonest obtaining of a financial advantage by that deception. A finding of dishonesty is subject to the appellant not believing that there were associated deductible expenses which exceeded the amount of income in question which had not been claimed.
	
	
	In Cramp v The Queen (1999) 110 A Crim R 198 the appellant was found guilty of manslaughter. The Crown case was that a 16 year old girl’s death resulted from his unlawful and dangerous act or gross negligence or both in allowing her to drive his car after “plying her with drinks and urging her to speed”. It was argued that the trial miscarried because the Crown relied on two bases for guilt and the judge failed to instruct the jury that they had to be unanimous on one basis or the other. That argument was rejected. After referring to a number of cases including Brown, R v Lievers and Ballinger [1999] 1 Qd R 649 at 662; R v Beach (1994) 75 A Crim R 447 at 453 (citing the decision in R v Clarke and Johnstone (1986) 21 A Crim R 135 at 154) and KBT v The Queen [1997] HCA 54; 191 CLR 417, Sully J (Ireland and Barr JJ agreeing) summarised the position as follows:
	


“[65]   A distinction is to be made between alternative factual bases of liability and alternative legal formulations of liability based on the same or substantially the same facts. The cases to which I have referred speak about the former. This appeal is about the latter.

[66]   The jury were obliged to consider the whole of the conduct of the appellant for the purpose of considering whether he caused the death of the deceased by his unlawful and dangerous act or by his gross negligence. Each process of reasoning invited by the Crown rested on substantially the same factual basis.”


	
	In Walsh the charges included conspiring with three others to defraud the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust by dishonestly inducing it to invest money in a purported investment scheme. It was argued that the conspiracy charge, as with some of the other charges, was bad for duplicity, or tainted by latent uncertainty or that the jury was not directed sufficiently on the need for unanimity because each count alleged more than one discrete act by the accused.
	
	
	The Court considered the two lines of authority referred to in Cramp. The first was the cases involving “murder, manslaughter and the like” where alternative legal bases of guilt depending on substantially the same facts were relied upon. The second comprised the cases principally concerned with crimes of dishonesty, and in particular, the obtaining of property by means of a false misrepresentation.
	
	
	Those cases include the decisions in Brown and More. It can be observed at this point that in the latter case the trial had been conducted on the basis that all of the representations stood or fell together. As we have already noted, in its oral submissions to this Court, the Crown argues that its case as left to the jury by the trial judge’s summing up was that each of the charges was proved only if the jury concluded that all of the disputed payments for the relevant year were income and believed to be income.
	
	
	In Walsh, the Court summarised the position as follows:
	


“[57]   To sum up the foregoing, it seems that the cases give rise to two situations at least (and if there be tension between them, this is not the case to resolve it, for it is only the second with which we are now concerned). The first is that exemplified by the cases concerning murder and manslaughter, where, when alternative legal bases of guilt are proposed by the Crown but depend substantially upon the same facts, there is no need for a direction on ‘unanimity’ about one or other or more of those bases, at least if they do not ‘involve materially different issues or consequences’. (How far in cases of murder or manslaughter this qualification extends - having regard especially to Clarke and Johnstone which has been long accepted in Victoria and to the similar practice in New South Wales - is of no present relevance). The second situation is where one offence is charged, such as obtaining property by deception, but a number of discrete acts is relied upon as proof and any one of them would entitle the jury to convict. If those discrete acts go to the proof of an essential ingredient of the crime charged, then the jury cannot convict unless they are agreed upon that act which, in their opinion, does constitute that essential ingredient. In this type of case, much will depend ‘upon the precise nature of the charge, the nature of the prosecution's case and the defence and what are the live issues at the conclusion of the evidence’. When the charge is obtaining property by deception by means of misrepresentation, the making of the misrepresentation has been regarded as an essential ingredient of the crime charged.”


	
	The Court concluded that a direction was not required because the crime alleged was a conspiracy to defraud and the means agreed upon by the conspirators to achieve that end was the dishonest making of false misrepresentations. In such a case the agreement to make any particular representation was not an essential element of the crime and accordingly not appropriately the subject of any specific direction as to unanimity. That is not this case.
	
	
	The statement of the relevant principles in Walsh was applied in Fermanis v The State of Western Australia [2007] WASCA 84; 33 WAR 434 at [68], [69], [73] (Steytler P, Roberts-Smith and McClure JJA agreeing) and approved by this Court in Chapman v R [2013] NSWCCA 91 at [28]-[29] (Adamson J, Hoeben CJ at CL and Davies J agreeing).
	
	
	It was also applied in Magnus v The Queen [2013] VSCA 163 where the Court (Buchanan, Ashley and Redlich JJA) rejected the Crown’s argument as contrary to its earlier decision in R v Holmes [2006] VSCA 73 at [35]-[37].
	
	
	The accused in Magnus was found guilty of 53 charges of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Each charge was in terms that on a specific date he made several representations to a specified investor who then invested a specified amount. The Crown contended on appeal that it was not necessary for the jury to be unanimous with respect to each charge that at least one particular representation had been operative. The Crown argument as recorded was:
	


“[16]   Counsel for the Crown submitted that the determinant whether unanimity is required is whether what is to be decided is proof of an element, or ‘essential ingredient’, of an offence or, alternatively, proof of an evidentiary matter relevant to proof of an element. The former requires unanimity; the latter does not. In this case, the element was ‘any deception’. There must be unanimity that a financial advantage was improperly obtained by any deception. But jurors might find the deception proved by different evidentiary pathways. So, if a charge specified a number of representations, jurors could unanimously find the deception proved in reliance upon different representations.”


	
	That argument was rejected. The Court held that where each of the particulars of deception may be sufficient to sustain the charge and the evidence leaves open the possibility of a finding that only one or some of the particulars have been established, a direction as to the need for unanimity will be required: [47]. “The jury must be agreed as to the particular words or conduct constituting a deception; and be agreed that as a consequence of those words or that conduct the accused obtained a financial advantage”: [49].
	
	
	The reference in Walsh at [57] to the need to consider the nature of the charge and case as conducted at trial when determining what elements require jury unanimity is from the judgment of Lord Ackner in More at 1584. Observations to the same effect were made by Elias CJ in her Honour’s dissenting judgment in R v Mead [2002] 1 NZLR 594 at [17], citing Fitzgerald P and Moynihan J in Leivers and Ballinger at 662:
	


“What elements are essential to criminal liability in the particular case and require jury unanimity is a practical question, not a technical one. It turns not only upon the legal elements of the offence but also the factual elements essential to the cases put for prosecution and defence:

‘It is important to emphasise that the criteria [for establishing what are the ‘essential elements of the case’] are not directly concerned with the legal constituent elements of the offence charged but with the actual issues which are prerequisites to a guilty verdict in the particular circumstances of the individual case’. (R v Leivers and Ballinger … at 662 …)”.

The elements of the offence charged


	
	The physical elements of the offence charged are the conduct constituting the deception and the result of that conduct which is the obtaining of a financial advantage. The deception must be intentional or reckless (s 133.1). In this context, a person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct (s 5.2(1)). The obtaining of the advantage must be dishonest (s 134.2(1)(a)) and accordingly it must be shown that the accused acted dishonestly according to the standards of ordinary people and knew that in obtaining that advantage he was acting dishonestly (s 130.3). Section 134.2(1)(a) requires that the financial advantage be obtained “by” the intentional deception which in this case was the deliberate non-disclosure of assessable income.
	
	
	To make out these elements of the offences charged, the Crown had to establish for each tax year that the appellant derived income that was not disclosed in the return lodged, that he knew or believed it was income, and that his failure to declare that income resulted in him dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage from the Commonwealth, namely the issue of an assessment of taxable income that was lower than it would have been had that income been taken into account. The requirement that the financial advantage be obtained “by” the intentional deception ties the advantage to the income which is the subject of the deception.
	
	
	It is in this respect that the present case differs from one where the offence charged is obtaining property or money by deception and it is alleged that there were several discrete misrepresentations each of which resulted in the obtaining of the property or money by deception. In such a case the jury must be unanimous as to at least one of the misrepresentations and that it resulted in the obtaining of the property or money. In the present case, although there is only one representation constituted by the lodging of the return for the particular tax year, the respect in which it is deceptive and results in the dishonest obtaining of a financial advantage may be proved by the knowing non-disclosure of discrete amounts of income. It is not, however, sufficient to prove an intentional deception by the non-declaration of one amount of income if the financial advantage relied upon results from the non-disclosure of another. In such a case, the financial advantage would not be “by” the intentional deception or justify a conclusion that the obtaining of that advantage was “dishonest”.
	


A more specific unanimity direction was required

The Crown case


	
	The Crown case was that the payments, direct and third party, were ordinary income derived by the appellant from the operations of CPI. Those payments were not distributions from a trustee to a beneficiary or loans or to be treated as fringe benefit payments. Nor were they payments to the appellant as agent for a third party or in reimbursement of expenses paid on behalf of a third party. They were derived by the appellant, either as remuneration for services provided to CPI, or by way of distribution of its profits. The non-declaration of those payments was alleged to have been an intentional deception and to have involved the appellant dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by that deception. In the Crown’s opening, the jury was told that it was for them to find what the income was “that should have been included” in the returns (8/49). The jury was also told that it would be suggested by the accused that the amounts received were loans, notwithstanding that there were no loan documents or other arrangements for repayment (8/68).
	
	
	In its closing address, the Crown described the fundamental issue as being whether the money paid directly to the St George bank account and to third parties was income that should have been declared by the appellant (10/1729). The appellant was said to have obtained a financial benefit if his income tax assessment was lower than it would have been “had the return included the disputed amounts” (10/1729).
	


The defence case


	
	In his short opening to the jury, the appellant’s counsel said that the defence case would focus on apparent differences between the various amounts said to have been income - moneys paid to third parties and used to acquire assets in their names, moneys received by the appellant on behalf of another party and moneys received by the appellant by way of loan (8/71). Those differences were said to be relevant not only to the characterisation of the payments as income but also to whether the appellant might have had an honest belief that they were not income.
	
	
	The defence case was directed to raising a doubt as to whether all and any of the amounts received by the appellant or at his direction paid to third parties, or for their benefit, were income. That was the only way in which the appellant could meet the allegations made against him because the Crown case was that there would have been an intentional deception and financial advantage obtained dishonestly in any relevant year if some income for that year knowingly was not disclosed.
	
	
	In his closing address, defence counsel referred to several matters about which the jury should have a “reasonable doubt” (10/1914-1916). The first was whether the Crown had established that the payments made came from CPI. The second was whether the third party payments used to purchase real property were income of the appellant. (Although this was not part of any closing submission, the premise of the Crown case was that those payments represented advances made to those third parties by the appellant from payments received from CPI. Other possibilities could have included that they were payments made from the third party’s own funds held by CPI or from funds borrowed by the third party, as appeared to be the case with 71 Cowper St.)
	
	
	The third was whether the payment used to purchase the helicopter in the name of the family trust ($180,000) had been borrowed by the trust from CPI. The fourth was that the fact that the trust was the owner of the motor vessel did not mean that money received by it was ordinary income of the appellant. (In fact the evidence suggested that the vessel was owned by a Vanuatu nominee company on behalf of the appellant. The possibility nevertheless remained that any moneys used by that company for that purpose were drawn from its own funds or from funds borrowed from CPI or some other entity.) The fifth was related to the second and third and was that there was some evidence that the loans from PPI to 71 Cowper St to purchase the Stroud Hardware Store property and business and from CPI to the family trust to purchase the helicopter, were repaid. The sixth was that there was also evidence that CPI had made significant loans to the appellant and that approximately $800,000 of those loans had been repaid. (That evidence was the accounts of CPI for the period ended 30 June 2009 which were dated 21 May 2012 and signed as audited by Mr Kym Butler (2/735, 734). This was well after the appellant became aware that his tax affairs were the subject of investigation on 3 December 2008, when search warrants were executed at properties owned or occupied by him.)
	
	
	Finally, it was said that at least in relation to the helicopter and motor vessel, to assess if there was taxable income it was necessary to consider if there were deductions associated with the respective charter businesses in which those assets were used or to be used. (This submission was directed to questions of financial advantage and dishonesty and whether the appellant’s taxable income was likely to have been higher had a particular disputed amount been declared and any associated deductible expenses claimed at the same time.)
	


The summing up


	
	The jury were given a document titled “General Written Directions” and a document titled “Tax Law Directions”. Those directions were also referred to in the trial judge’s summing up. The General Written Directions included the following:
	


“4.    The fundamental issues in contention, in relation to each charge:

a)   Was the amount, in relation to each year, income of Mr Pratten? and

b)   If the amount was income of Mr Pratten, did he act dishonestly when he failed to declare it?

…

7.    In other words, in this case, in relation to each year that is subject to a charge, you, the jury, must be satisfied:

a)   That there were amounts of income received by Mr Pratten that were his income and not declared; and

b)   He acted dishonestly in not declaring them.

The second element in (b) above, involves a number of aspects:

(i)   Dishonesty or “dishonestly” is to be given its ordinary meaning;

(ii)   In order to have acted “dishonestly”, Mr Pratten, in the circumstances of this case, must have:

•   Know the amounts were income in his hand;

•   Deliberately failed to declare them; and

•   Acted with the purpose, by deceiving the Commonwealth, of obtaining a financial advantage.”


	
	In his summing up the trial judge made similar observations as to the matters in issue. They included (1/62-64):
	


“[63]   … If the disputed amounts to which the Crown have referred were income of Mr Pratten, then it was required to be declared and, since it was not declared, there was a financial advantage. But the real issue, in that respect, depends on whether it is income.

[64]    The fundament issues in contention as I point out in [4] in relation to each charge is was the amount, in relation to each year, income of Mr Pratten, and secondly, if the amount was income of Mr Pratten, did he act dishonestly when he failed to declare it?”

…

“[69]    As I say in 7, in other words, in this case, in relation to each year that is subject to a charge, you the jury must be satisfied firstly, that there were amounts of income received by Mr Pratten that were his income and not declared, and he acted dishonestly in not declaring them”

…

“[71]    If there be, in relation to any charge, a rational basis, on the evidence that you, the jury, accept, that the disputed amounts received were not income, you must return a verdict of not guilty to that charge (and if that applies to all charges, you would return a verdict of not guilty to all charges).”

…

“[72]    Even if, on your view, there is no rational basis for the amounts been other than income, you must return a verdict of not guilty, firstly, if there be a rational basis for the view that Mr Pratten did not know it was income at the time the income tax return was lodged, or if there be a rational basis for a view that Mr Pratten was not acting dishonestly”.

Why a specific unanimity direction was required in this case


	
	The Crown submits that the jury must have understood these directions as referring to the disputed amounts as an undifferentiated whole and as requiring that it address whether the Crown had proved guilt on that basis such that the jurors had to agree that all disputed amounts in each year were income dishonestly not declared and that their verdicts should be understood on that basis.
	
	
	We are unable to accept this submission. At the very least the jury may have understood (correctly) that all that the Crown was required to establish was that any one disputed payment, or group of disputed payments having the same characteristics, was or were income which was deliberately not declared.
	
	
	We have set out earlier in these reasons the direction as to unanimity which the trial judge did give. Having regard to the evidence led in the Crown case, the instruction that the jurors did not have to agree “on the same reasons” for their verdict and that they may place a different emphasis “on different aspects of the way in which the matter has been argued” may have left them believing that they did not have to be unanimous as to the basis upon which there had been an intentional deception and the obtaining of a financial advantage before returning a unanimous verdict of guilty for a particular count.
	
	
	In his summing up, the trial judge referred to various of the arguments put on behalf of the defence. When doing so he drew attention to the various payments in dispute and different questions which arose in relation to the characterisation of those payments as income. For example (1/78):
	


“[143]   It is necessary that I tell you, that because what you see in evidence are payments by companies for land; payments by a Trust company for land and of itself; and without more that would not be illegal or taxable (or not in the hands of Mr Pratten in any event), because ultimately you will have to be convinced this [was] income of Mr Pratten personally, not income of the Trust, not income of one the companies, but income of Mr Pratten personally.”


	
	When addressing arguments of the defence in relation to specific disputed payments, the trial judge recognised that it was open to the jury to conclude that some only of those payments were income. The trial judge (correctly) did not direct the jurors that in that event they must find the appellant not guilty of the charge for the relevant year.
	
	
	The first group of these disputed payments was with respect to the school fees. The defence argument was that the Crown had not excluded the possibility that those payments were made from funds of the family trust or otherwise to the children so as to be income in their hands rather than income of the appellant. The jury was told (1/82):
	


“[162]   If either one of those are additional matters upon which you could not draw an inference of the kind I have already referred, then you would not be able to hold that the school fees were matters for the benefit of Mr Pratten and therefore included in his income tax.”


	
	The second group comprised those in respect of which it was submitted the Crown had not excluded the possibility that they were loans from CPI to the appellant. With respect to those payments, the trial judge pointed out at [191] that in some cases “there were said to be loan amounts or loan agreements” and there was some evidence of loans between the companies and of the repayment of those loans. The jury was told (1/94):
	


“[193]   The fact is that loan agreements are not before you, but there is evidence of repayments and the entries in and notes on the accounts and whether some of the amounts were loans, is a matter that is reasonably available as an inference, available on the material before you. If, as I say, you are of the view that these amounts being loans is a reasonably available inference, then that is inconsistent with those amounts being income for the reasons I have given you, namely, that ordinarily loans are not income.”


	
	In relation to each of these categories of payments, the jurors were directed that they might not be satisfied that they were income. In the absence of a direction that the consequence would be that the charge for any relevant year could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt, the jurors were likely to have assumed that they could rely on the non-disclosure of other income in that year as sufficient to prove guilt. This may also have been confirmed, to some extent, by the terms of the general direction as to unanimity which was given. It is also likely to have been reinforced by the fact that the trial judge did give a direction at [165] that in the event the jurors were not satisfied that all of the disputed amounts came from CPI, they should return a verdict of not guilty.
	
	
	Most significantly, the direction in relation to the director’s fees received by the appellant in the tax years ending 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2009, made clear that the jury might reject the Crown’s case that those fees were income, but convict on the basis that other income was knowingly not disclosed. The evidence was that in about June 2008 the appellant was appointed managing director of CPI because of the unavailability of Mr Agius (7/185). In relation to that appointment, the appellant requested and was paid $5,000 per month over a period of five or six months. Several of those payments were made from the IFTCO account and into the appellant’s St George Bank account following requests made by him to PKF Vanuatu (5/20, 22, 7/194, 13/17).
	
	
	The appellant did not include these amounts in the original returns for these years which were lodged in September 2009. However, he did include them in amended returns lodged within the statutory period allowed for doing so. In relation to those payments, the trial judge told the jury (1/96):
	


“[198]   If no other income were taken into account and one was dealing only with the director’s fees, in fact, there may there is a real question about financial advantage, because in the end, the effect of declaring the director’s fees was not to occasion taxable income, that is, it didn’t overcome the losses that were otherwise occasioned by the Myidaho business and other aspects. The director’s fees themselves and by themselves would not give rise to a financial advantage of the kind the Crown would otherwise be able to show unless you took into account, on their submission, income from IFTCO and VITCO and other matters.

[199]   The other aspect of the director’s fees is well, it’s a matter for your common experience but the matters, indeed a number of other matters, went straight into Mr Pratten’s personal bank account. I don’t think there is any evidence as to the availability of people’s bank accounts to the Tax Department, but given what otherwise sophisticated arrangements for his income and the way in which money was dealt, with you are faced with the proposition that, if it were only that amount, whether it was just carelessness or dishonesty, and that would be a big issue in relation to that. I don’t think anyone has suggested Mr Pratten is stupid, but that’s a different question and raises different issues.”


	
	These observations are not consistent with the position being, as urged by the Crown, that the case which the trial judge left to the jury was one that required them to be satisfied that all of the disputed amounts were income, the non-disclosure of which resulted in a financial advantage to the appellant in each tax year. At the conclusion of the summing up, the trial judge directed the jury that there were three questions to be addressed. They were:
	


“[203]   First, in each year to which charge relates, whether the amounts Mr Pratten received from IFTCO or VITCO or the payments made from IFTCO and VITCO were income to Mr Pratten?

[204]   That involves two sub questions: Was it income and secondly, was it income to Mr Pratten?

[205]   The second question that you face is: did Mr Pratten know the receipts and payments were income that was required to be declared?

[206]   And the third is: did he dishonestly deceive the Commonwealth to obtain a financial advantage?”


	
	Taking account of the directions to which reference has been made, and in particular that the jury might convict if some only of the disputed payments were income, the jurors are likely to have understood the first and second of these questions to be referring to some or all of the disputed payments.
	
	
	In this way, the Crown case and the evidence left open the possibility that none or some only of the disputed payments might be found to be income which the appellant knowingly did not disclose and that there were no offsetting deductions available which may have justified a belief that no income tax would be avoided by the non-disclosure of those payments. The directions recognised that the jury might convict even though they were satisfied that only some of the disputed payments were income.
	
	
	That in turn left open the real possibility that jurors could be satisfied that the appellant had obtained a financial advantage by deception, without being unanimous as to the payments constituting non-disclosed income by which that advantage was derived. This may be illustrated by taking the first count as an example. The total of the payments made from the VITCO account in the financial year ended 30 June 2003 was $1,068,706. Of that amount, $389,989 was paid into the appellant’s St George account, $458,825 was paid for the acquisition of the “Skallet” property by PPI and $219,983 was paid for the acquisition of the Stroud Hardware Store (real property $180,000 and stock $40,000) by 71 Cowper St. The defence case was that if the direct payments came from CPI the reasonable possibilities which had not been excluded were that they were loans to the appellant, or reimbursement of expenses of CPI or of RGIB which had been paid by him or payments received on behalf of RGIB and subsequently transferred to it. As to the two payments used to acquire the properties, the defence case was that they could have been moneys of PPI, in the latter case loaned by it to 71 Cowper St. PPI in turn could have borrowed that money or been entitled to it as income or existing funds held by IFTCO. In those circumstances the defence argued that it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that the payments were income of the appellant or that he obtained any benefit dishonestly by failing to declare them as income.
	
	
	It was possible that seven jurors might have been satisfied that the direct payments were income whilst five, accepting those payments to be made by way of loan were not satisfied that they were income, but were satisfied that the indirect payments were income. All of the jurors might have concluded that the appellant was guilty of the first offence charged. The seven might have reasoned that there was a dishonest financial advantage obtained by the intentional deception involved in not disclosing the amount of the direct payments as income. The remaining jurors might have reached a similar conclusion but in relation to an intentional deception based on different income not being disclosed. The financial advantage dishonestly obtained is different in each case. For the seven jurors it would have been the appellant not being assessed as liable to pay the additional income tax due if the direct payments had been disclosed. For the remaining jurors it would have been the appellant not being assessed to pay the additional tax due if the third party payments had been disclosed as income. While there would have been unanimity as to the intentional deception that resulted in the obtaining of the financial advantage as between the seven jurors and unanimity as to the dishonest obtaining of the different financial advantage found by the remaining jurors, there would not have been the unanimity essential to a finding of guilt.
	
	
	That being the position, it was necessary that the jury be given a unanimity direction of the kind contended for by the appellant. Such a direction was not sought by the appellant at the trial. Nor was there any challenge made to the adequacy of the general direction as to unanimity which was given. That being the position, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. However, the Crown accepts that if we conclude that the further direction should have been given, the appellant should have leave to rely on ground 1A.
	
	
	The conclusion we have reached as to the basis on which the charges were left to the jury is the same as that accepted by the Crown, the defence and the trial judge as the basis on which the sentencing hearing would be conducted. We should make clear, however, that our conclusion is arrived at only upon a consideration of the transcript of the trial proceedings including the summing up, the trial judge’s written directions and the evidence.
	
	
	The question which then arises is whether the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act applies. In our view it does not. As we have already observed, the appellant was entitled to a trial “in which the relevant law is correctly explained to the jury and the rules of procedure and evidence are strictly followed”: Mraz at 514. In this case, the omission to explain to the jury that it had to be unanimous as to the satisfaction of each of the elements of the offence involved a “departure from the essential requirements of the law”, which we consider went to the root of the proceedings: Wilde v The Queen [1988] HCA 6; 164 CLR 365 at 373. See also Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300 at [45]-[46]; AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at [53]-[55]; Gassy v The Queen [2008] HCA 18; 236 CLR 293 at [34]; Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; 246 CLR 92 at [31]-[32]. The lack of a unanimity direction in the circumstances of this case involved “such a serious breach of the presuppositions of the trial as to deny the application of the proviso”: Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358 at [125]. Putting the matter slightly differently, the appellant was convicted of serious criminal offences “following a trial at which the prosecution case was conducted, and left to the jury, on a basis for which the law did not provide”: Handlen v The Queen [2011] HCA 51; 245 CLR 282 at [47]. Furthermore, this is not a case in which it may safely be concluded that had the jurors been directed specifically as to the need for unanimity they necessarily would have found that the appellant was guilty of one or more of the offences charged. We have formed that view notwithstanding that we consider, in relation to ground 7, that it was open on the evidence for the jury, had it been properly instructed, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of each of the offences charged.
	
	
	It follows that the appellant was deprived of a chance of acquittal which was fairly open. He should be granted leave to rely on ground 1A and the appeal on that ground should be upheld.
	


Conviction appeal: ground 2


	
	Ground 2 is:
	


“The trial judge erred in failing to direct a verdict of acquittal and in failing to find there could be no financial advantage by way of understatement of taxable income in a tax return in the circumstances where an amended assessment has been issued and where the General Interest Charge and Administrative Penalties are levied.”


	
	In the course of the trial, the appellant applied for a verdict by direction on each of the counts in the indictment on the basis that there could be no financial advantage by way of understatement of taxable income in circumstances where an amended assessment has been issued and the general interest charge and administrative penalties have been levied. In a judgment delivered on 28 May 2012, the trial judge rejected that application (1/128-136). This ground of appeal argues that the trial judge erred in doing so and in leaving to the jury the question whether the appellant could have obtained a financial advantage by way of understatement of his taxable income.
	
	
	The appellant makes three submissions in support of this argument. First, it is said that his liability to income tax arises at the time income is derived notwithstanding that the tax is only due and payable and the subject of a debt due to the Commonwealth when a notice of assessment has issued. It follows, it is said, that there could be no financial advantage obtained by filing a false tax return if the financial advantage alleged is a reduction in the taxpayer’s ultimate liability to pay tax. That argument may be put to one side because that is not the financial advantage upon which the Crown relied.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the financial advantage obtained by not declaring income was the amount by which the income tax that the appellant was deemed, by the lodging of the return, to be assessed as liable to pay, was less than it would have been had that amount been declared as income.
	
	
	The statutory regime provided that income tax became due and payable by the appellant 21 days after the due date for lodgement of his return or after a notice of assessment was given, whichever was the later: s 204(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (ITAA36). The appellant was deemed to have received a notice of assessment of his taxable income and of the tax payable on that taxable income on the filing of each of his tax returns: s 166A of ITAA36. The amount of tax which by s 204(1) then became due and payable was the amount specified in each return. Once that tax-related liability was due and payable, the amount of the tax was a debt due to the Commonwealth and payable to the Commissioner of Taxation: Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth), Schedule 1, s 255-5.
	
	
	The appellant’s second submission accepts that upon the deemed assessment arising from the lodging of the return, there was an amount of tax due and payable which was less than the amount that otherwise would have been due and payable had there been full disclosure. He argues, however, that once an amended assessment or default assessment was issued that “theoretical advantage has been obliterated by the operation of statute, by the imposition of interest and penalties”. It is submitted that there was no financial advantage in merely delaying the requirement to pay the tax due because any such advantage is more than compensated for by the statutory interest and penalties. This argument implicitly assumes that the question of advantage is to be measured over a period of time rather than at the time of the deemed assessment. The appellant’s third submission is that unless and until the objection and appeals process in relation to any assessment is complete, it cannot be known whether there has been a financial advantage. This argument involves the same assumption and taken to its extreme is that there could never be an advantage whilst there remains the possibility of discovery and further assessment.
	
	
	Each of these submissions must be rejected. The financial advantage on which the Crown relies is that obtained, upon the lodgement of a return which understates income, in being subject to a debt which is due and payable to and recoverable by the Commonwealth that is less than the amount of the debt that would have been due and payable and recoverable had there been full disclosure.
	
	
	It does not matter that what is claimed to be the financial advantage may turn out only to be temporary or that it may be overcome by subsequent events. As Nettle JA’s discussion in R v Vasic [2005] VSCA 38; 11 VR 380 at [14]-[16] shows, the undefined expression “financial advantage” is a broad one capable of including the deferring of the incurring of a liability to pay a debt, or greater debt, as due to the Commonwealth.
	
	
	The argument put to this Court was rejected by the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland in R v Jo [2012] QCA 356. In that appeal the relevant charges also were made under s 134.2 of the Criminal Code Act. Four of the counts charged were that the appellant had by a deception dishonestly obtained a financial advantage from the Commonwealth by causing the lodgement with the Commissioner of Taxation of personal income tax returns which contained false information. As in this case, it was argued that there had been no financial advantage because long after the lodgement of the relevant returns amended assessments were issued making the appellant liable for the unpaid tax and imposed a compounding general interest charge. It was said that the appellant obtained no financial advantage by delaying the time at which those amounts became due and payable. The Court (Fraser JA, Muir JA and Fryberg J agreeing) rejected that argument. It was held at [44]-[45] that the offence was complete upon the lodging of the relevant return when the advantage of being subject to a lesser liability was obtained and that it was irrelevant that subsequently the taxpayer’s dishonesty was or might be discovered and become the subject of an amended assessment and the imposition of interest and tax penalties. We agree with and adopt that reasoning.
	
	
	The position argued for by the appellant ignores the fact that upon the lodgement of the return, assuming a lower liability to pay tax than would otherwise have been the case, the taxpayer was subject to a lesser liability. The fact of that lesser liability was itself a financial advantage. That was so notwithstanding that at some time in the future that position might change.
	
	
	We conclude that the expression “financial advantage” is broad enough to include being subject to a lesser liability as a result of the lodging of a false return. The trial judge did not err in leaving the question whether there was a financial advantage to the jury. To the extent that leave to appeal on this ground is required, that leave is refused. Otherwise, the ground of appeal is dismissed.
	


Conviction appeal: ground 3


	
	Ground 3 is:
	


“The trial miscarried because the Assessments were admitted into evidence:

a) when they were not relevant and therefore inadmissible; …”


	
	The assessments referred to are the notices of amended assessment issued by the Commissioner of Taxation on 4 August 2010 or 1 December 2010 relating to the relevant tax years (1/435-467). By those amended assessments, the Commissioner amended his assessment of the appellant’s taxable income for each relevant year and his assessment of the amount of tax payable for that year. The appellant asserts that the evidence of those assessments was not admissible because it was not relevant to any issue in the trial.
	
	
	The Crown contends that this ground should be rejected for three reasons. First, the evidence had limited relevance and the basis upon which it was admitted was such that it would have had little, if any, impact on the jury’s deliberations. Secondly, the directions given to the jury were such that it cannot sensibly be argued that there was any prejudice to the appellant resulting from the admission of the evidence on a limited basis. Thirdly, the Crown says that leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be refused because the admission of those assessments in evidence on that limited basis followed a considered forensic decision by the appellant’s counsel to withdraw an objection made earlier in the trial.
	
	
	The tender of the amended assessments was subject to objection in the course of a voir dire conducted on 14 March 2012, which was before the trial commenced. The ruling on the objection to that evidence was deferred until a Crown witness from the Australian Taxation Office, Mr Barns, was called to give evidence (1/44). More than two months later, on 21 May 2012, the amended assessments were sought to be tendered through Mr Barns (10/1512). Those assessments were the documents behind Tabs 18 and 19 of what became Ex P 150 (1/437-468). The assessments were admitted into evidence without objection subject to an order under s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) limiting the use to which they could be put to proving that the assessments had been made and issued (10/1519).
	
	
	That agreement emerged on that day following an earlier discussion, in the absence of the jury (9/1273-1276). In that context, counsel for the appellant observed that if the amended or default assessments were admitted on a limited basis or subject to a direction warning the jury not to use them for all purposes then a subsidiary question arising in connection with the efficacy of a notice issued under s 264 of ITAA36 was likely to “fall away” (9/1276).
	
	
	In his summing up, the trial judge gave the following directions as to the limited basis upon which the amended or default assessments were in evidence and able to be used (1/65-66):
	


“[79]   In this regard I should tell you this. You have received some evidence from the Australian Tax Office, and in receiving it you received evidence of what they regarded as income tax that was owing on the money that they say is income in Mr Pratten’s hands.

[80]   Their view of the evidence is just that: it’s their view of the income tax. But I should tell you that the Australian Taxation Office and the Tax Commissioner has powers that are irrelevant for their purposes, and how they are calculated is in one sense just their opinion. So you will have to come to you own opinion as to whether income tax is payable, and whether income is received, and in that sense what is relevant about the tax department is they say some tax is payable and he hasn’t paid all his tax. That is relevant only because, were it otherwise, there could be no financial advantage. That is the only thing that is relevant about that evidence, and the actual amounts involved and the calculation of them is not really central to the decision you have to make about guilt or innocence.”


	
	Whilst there may be force in the appellant’s contention that the Tax Commissioner’s opinion could not rationally affect the assessment of a fact in issue, there is equal force in the Crown’s contention that no miscarriage of justice occurred by the admission of the assessments into evidence on a limited basis, because of the directions that were given.
	
	
	The parties had agreed that the assessments would be admitted on a limited basis. The Crown contended that the assessments showed that the appellant had paid less tax than he would have been liable to pay had there been disclosure in the amounts the Crown alleged. That much would have been self-evident to the jury if it accepted that the appellant had deliberately understated his income in the various returns by the amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars. That was, as the trial judge’s directions made clear, one of the questions that the jury was called upon to answer. In our view, in the light of the clear directions given, the assessments would have had no impact on the jury’s consideration of that question. For that reason, the admission of the evidence on the limited basis did not cause the trial to miscarry.
	
	
	That is sufficient to dispose of this ground. Additionally, we agree with the Crown’s submission that leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was required and should be refused. The ultimate admission of the evidence on a limited basis followed a considered forensic decision by the appellant’s counsel to withdraw an objection made earlier. That decision did not involve any waiver of the application of the rules of evidence within s 190 of the Evidence Act. These conclusions make it unnecessary to consider whether the amended assessments were relevant within s 55(1) of the Evidence Act. Irrespective of whether they were relevant, their admission into evidence on the limited basis and subject to the directions meant that the trial did not miscarry. Leave to raise this ground on appeal is refused and the ground is otherwise dismissed.
	


Conviction appeal: ground 4


	
	Ground 4 is:
	


“Insofar as the alleged financial advantage was grounded in taxable income, the trial miscarried by reason of the trial judge failing to direct the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that deductions in connection with each item of allegedly undisclosed income did not exceed the relevant item of alleged income”


	
	The essence of the appellant’s argument is that the trial judge did not direct the jury as to the need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not have deductions that were associated with any disputed amount or amounts of income and that those deductions had to be taken into account when considering whether there was a financial advantage obtained and, if so, whether that advantage was obtained dishonestly.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the trial judge’s directions were adequate and contends that except in relation to amounts held to be income associated with the helicopter and motor vessel, the defence made no real attempt to establish that there may have been allowable and unclaimed deductions for expenses which could have exceeded the amounts held to be income.
	
	
	In our view, the closing submissions of the parties and the directions given by the trial judge were sufficient to make clear to the jury that when addressing questions of financial advantage and dishonesty, it was necessary to take into account not only the income which had not been disclosed but also whether there were any deductions associated with that income.
	
	
	The trial judge directed the jury in relation to the relevance of deductions both in the Tax Law Directions and in the course of the summing up. The former included the following (1/110):
	


“Taxable income.

22.   Taxable income is calculated by determining the assessable income minus all allowable deductions and offsets.

Deductions

23.   A taxpayer may deduct from their assessable income any ‘loss or outgoing’ to the extent that it is incurred in gaining or producing their assessable income, or if it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business or for the purpose of producing assessable income.

24.   A taxpayer may be able to claim, as a deduction, any tax losses arising from prior income years.

25.   Where assessable income exceeds deductions, the balance is taxable income.”


	
	These directions were repeated in the summing up (1/71-72):
	


“110   Paragraph 22 of WD2 basically repeats what has earlier been put in a little solilogy, namely, that taxable income is calculated by taking assessable income and subtracting all allowable deductions and offsets.

111   At paragraph 23 of WD2, I state that a taxpayer may deduct from their assessable income any loss or outgoing to the extent that it is incurred in gaining or producing their assessable income, of if it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business or for the purpose of producing assessable income.

112   A taxpayer may be able to claim as a deduction any losses arising from prior income years. And lastly, on that sub-heading ‘Where assessable income exceeds deductions’ and this is quite obvious, ‘the balance is taxable income.’”


	
	In the course of the summing up the trial judge also made clear that there could be no financial advantage unless some tax was payable in relation to the income which was not disclosed: see [76], [80] (1/65-66). The need for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that deductions in connection with items of disputed income did not exceed the amount of that income was addressed specifically by the appellant’s counsel in relation to the helicopter and motor vessel and by the trial judge in relation to the director’s fees received in 2008 and 2009. As to the former, the appellant’s counsel submitted, having referred to the helicopter and motor vessel being either in charter or being prepared for charter (10/1915):
	


“So in order to ascertain whether or not there was a taxable income liability, if you say it was assessable income, you would have to take into account the deductions that were associated in that charter business. In my submission, in relation to those transactions, and in relation to deductions more generally that can be ascertained, I submit there is a doubt in relation to those also.”


	
	In relation to the director’s fees, the relevant direction of the trial judge was in [198] (1/96), which is set out earlier in this judgment. In that paragraph, the trial judge made clear that if there were expenses or business losses which might exceed any relevant income, there would be a “real question about financial advantage, because in the end, the effect of declaring the director’s fees was not to occasion taxable income”.
	
	
	For these reasons ground 4 is rejected.
	


Conviction appeal: ground 7


	
	Ground 7 is that the verdicts resulted in a miscarriage of justice, or are unreasonable, or cannot be supported by the evidence.
	
	
	This ground requires that the Court address “whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty”: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [25], [58]; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11], [12]. That involves the Court making “an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality”: SKA at [14]; and disclosing in its reasons its assessment of the capacity of the evidence to support the verdicts: BCM v The Queen [2013] HCA 48; 88 ALJR 101 at [31]. It is not enough for this Court to consider only whether there is evidence to support the verdicts or whether there was evidence on which a jury could convict. We must determine whether notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, “none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand”: M at 492-493.
	
	
	Taking account of our earlier discussion as to the need for a specific unanimity direction, we must make our own assessment of whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in each relevant tax year the appellant knowingly did not disclose some income and thereby obtained a financial advantage.
	
	
	The first matter about which the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt was that the appellant had an interest in CPI which entitled him to a share of its profits. The appellant was a major shareholder (indirectly) of RGIL, an Australian insurer. In 2002 RGIL ceased to issue insurance. At the same time an insurer with a very similar name, RGII, was incorporated in Vanuatu and the appellant and Mr Stephenson established RGIB. That broker then entered into an agency agreement with RGII/CPI. The premiums from the business RGIB introduced to CPI were paid initially into an account of VITCO, and later into an account of IFTCO. In 2005 Mr Cantwell, based on information provided to him by the appellant (9/729-730), put together an information memorandum to be used to place CPI’s reinsurance program in the London market for the 2005/2006 underwriting year. That memorandum included the following statement (7/68):
	


“Rural and General was a licensed Australian insurance company until 2002 when it was unable to meet the new standards set down by regulators (APRA) for Australian insurance companies; as a small niche market insurer, it decided to go into solvent run-off like many other similar companies in Australia. The management and shareholders of Rural and General obtained underwriting support from the Vanuatu Insurance industry and set up Commercial Pacific Insurance Ltd.”


	
	There were also in evidence several transcripts of intercepted telephone conversations to which the appellant was a party. Some of those conversations occurred after search warrants were executed on 3 December 2008 at properties owned or occupied by the appellant. One such conversation was between the appellant and the accountant, Mr Greer on 5 December 2008. It included the following. (The references to the “company” are to be understood as being to CPI) (1/184):
	


“Appellant:   … the broking business started with the Vanuatu business in on twenty August two thousand and two

… We had a seven year period in which um er I would get to have the company

… Right and of course the company had to cease writing business on the thirtieth of June 2008

… Two months before um two months or three months before ah the period it had to cease writing business because of Australian laws

… I don’t want the company now

… It’s got no income and it’s going to go exactly the same way as the old RGI company into run-off”


	
	At some time after 2005, the appellant told Mr Cantwell in a conversation in Sydney that he owned or had an interest in CPI (9/740, 790-791). Also, in an email to Mr Greer dated 17 December 2007 the appellant stated (7/152):
	


“I have a beneficial interest in Commercial Pacific Insurance Ltd (CPI) which is a Vanuatu registered insurance company.

My beneficial interest is that I will receive 25% of the profits of the business after it is wound up and by constitution it has to be within 10 years of its operations, ie 2012.”

That email was sent in the context of Mr Greer preparing the appellant’s tax returns for the years ended 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2007. Draft returns were prepared by him, but not filed. In July 2009 Mr Berry and Ms Hamberger prepared returns for those years together with the returns for the years ended 30 June 2008 and 30 June 2009. In his closing address to the jury, the appellant’s counsel made clear that he was not submitting that the appellant did not have a beneficial interest in CPI (10/1886).


	
	The second matter as to which the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt was that the payments made from the VITCO and IFTCO accounts to the appellant or to third parties were moneys of CPI. The evidence established that in each of the tax years in question moneys were paid by RGIB to VITCO or IFTCO as premiums due to CPI and that subsequently lesser amounts were paid out of those accounts either to RGIB, to the appellant or, at his direction, to or for the benefit of third parties. (The payments back to RGIB were principally for commissions due under the agency agreements (2/550, 1/353)). The amounts of these various payments are set out in the table below (1/353-354, 356-357, 358-370):

	The real issue for the jury was not whether these payments made out of the VITCO and IFTCO accounts were funds of CPI. It was whether those funds were paid to the appellant or at his direction by way of loan, or to him as agent or recipient for another party, or by way of distribution of trust funds to him, or by way of reimbursement to him of expenses paid on another party’s behalf.
	
	
	Accounts of CPI for the years ended 31 December 2003, 31 December 2004, 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006 and for the further period ended 30 June 2009 were in evidence. They disclosed that CPI made significant profits in those years and for that period and that those profits were available for distribution. Those accounts also showed CPI having made unsecured loans. The accounts for the period ended 30 June 2009 identified the borrowers as including the appellant ($2,559,427) and PPI ($826,760). The profits and loans shown in those accounts were (2/691-743):

	The accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 are dated and signed in August 2005, as audited by Mr Kym Butler. Those for the year ended 31 December 2005 appear to have been audited in June 2008. The accounts for the period ended 31 December 2006 are signed and dated as audited in June 2008 and those for the period ended 30 June 2009 are signed and dated as audited in May 2012. The audit opinions for the periods ending 31 December 2005, 31 December 2006 and 30 June 2009 are qualified. Each contains a note that CPI did not provide details in relation to debts due from RGIB and commissions payable to it (2/714, 724, 735). The accounts for the period ended 30 June 2009 also record that well after the balance date, namely in January 2011, the appellant sold two shares in 71 Cowper St to CPI for $876,456 “to reduce the existing Unsecured Loan” (2/743).
	
	
	The evidence was that in the period between January 2005 and June 2008, when PKF Vanuatu was “administering” the affairs of CPI and PPI, the appellant would make requests for payments from IFTCO either into his personal account or to a third party in payment of an expense or to enable an asset acquisition to proceed. Those requests took several forms. Some merely requested that Mr Johns “arrange payment of the following invoices by TT” (2/516, 520) or made a similar request of Mr Agius (2/517, 518). In others requests were made to “borrow” funds (2/521, 533, 535) or that funds be “advanced” (2/522, 524). Some requests by the appellant were made for “assistance in financing” purchases (2/530). A request made in August 2007 referred to a “confirmation that the loans are available” and made payment requests, some for “standard debts” and others in respect of “property settlements” (2/538). The “standard debts” included rent on the Darling Point property and fees paid to two private schools in Sydney (2/538). Payments of those expenses were made in the tax years ended 2005 through to 2009 and the amounts of the relevant payments are shown in Schedule 1 to this judgment.
	
	
	There were other references in the evidence to moneys being advanced by way of loan from CPI to the appellant. For example, the telephone intercept recordings include a conversation on 3 December 2008 between the appellant and Mr Agius. That conversation was shortly after the search warrants had been executed on that day (2/492):
	


“Appellant:   … I said well hang on a second um that’s not quite how it works um money goes off overseas to an insurance company not a brokerage the brokerage puts the money into an insurance company the insurance company then pays claims has expenses and then after all that there may be a profit depending on what the I-B-N-R is and then after that um after that I may take a loan from time to time and that’s about it for which I you know may or may not pay interest on and I’ve got to pay it back one day so hello.”


	
	IBNR is an acronym for “incurred but not reported”. It refers to liabilities or losses to policies issued by an insurer which have occurred but not yet been reported to the insurer. They represent future liabilities of the insurer. In other conversations at around this time, the appellant made similar statements concerning loans that were made from the profits of CPI. He told Mr Berry on 4 December 2008 (1/242) that in relation to his “Vanuatu dealings” he had “always borrowed money ah over there in order to you know um buy things for the farm”. In another conversation on the same day, he said to Mr Greer (1/176) that “I’ve got a feeling what they’re gunna say is any money that came over to me personally from Vanuatu was income”.
	
	
	In an intercepted conversation with Kelly Fawcett of PKF Vanuatu on 4 December 2008, the appellant was recorded as saying (2/508-509):
	


“… I wanna work out exactly dollar for dollar ah what all of the loans have been over the years … I wanna make sure that that’s done so and I just wanna make sure ‘cause if they decide to say a lot of it is income or whatever and I argue that if I argue it successfully I argue it but if I argue it and lose there’s a lot of that money was spent on business type things which are deductible this end you know what I mean.

And when I come over I’ll have a look at all the transfers and work out which went where and what was for each one and are there’ll be … There’ll be I imagine there’ll be a couple of hundred but um it won’t take that long to go through and determine what the hell goes on.”


	
	The appellant also said to Mr Berry in an email dated 12 December 2008 (11/38):
	


“The moneys I borrowed are bundled up in a whole bunch of loans I have with another organisation and are not repayable as yet, there will be some interest payable I suppose, but, not yet sure.”


	
	The Crown case was that all of the payments made from the VITCO and IFTCO accounts into the appellant’s bank account, or to pay personal expenses due to third parties, were income derived by him. However, for the purpose of addressing this ground of appeal in relation to each of the seven years, it is sufficient to take the payments made into the St George account in the years ended 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2004 and the payments made to third parties of school fees and rent in each of the years ended 30 June 2005 to 30 June 2009.
	
	
	In the financial years ended 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2004, the payments into the appellant’s St George account were $389,898 and $296,117. The fact of those payments was proved by Ms Celona’s evidence. The appellant argued that there were three rational hypotheses consistent with those payments not being received by him as income. They were that the payments were loans to him or the reimbursement of expenses of CPI or RGIB which he had paid or moneys received by him which were then paid on to RGIB shortly after their receipt. It was said that the hypothesis that those moneys were received as agent or on behalf of RGIB could not be excluded. In the year ended 30 June 2003 the expenses of RGIB which it was suggested had been paid by the appellant were $110,648 and in the year ended 30 June 2004 the amount of those expenses was said to be $74,800 (3/968). The amounts said to have been received and then paid to RGIB were $198,006 in the year ended 30 June 2003 and $99,630 in the year ended 30 June 2004 (3/968).
	
	
	It is not necessary to deal with the second of these hypotheses. The difficulty for the third is that the evidence also showed that in each of these years the payments to RGIB which followed shortly after the receipt of payments from VITCO were to discharge loans owing by the appellant to RGIB. In other words, the amounts of $198,006 and $99,630 received from VITCO were applied to discharge personal obligations of the appellant to RGIB (13/1-7; 14/27; 2/552).
	
	
	An examination of the other drawings on the appellant’s St George account during these two years shows that $25,904 was withdrawn by ATM in the year ended 30 June 2003 and $177,287 was paid to Visa in satisfaction of credit card purchases. A number of those purchases related to personal living expenses (14/27). In the year ended 30 June 2004, the amount withdrawn by ATM was $51,340 and the amount paid in satisfaction of Visa credit card purchases was $75,405 (14/59). (Those significant drawings by ATM continued throughout the remaining years in question (14/84-88)).
	
	
	Thus, the evidence was that in each of these two financial years the appellant received payments from VITCO into his personal bank account which were applied in satisfaction of his personal loan obligations to RGIB and in payment of living and other personal expenses. The sum of those payments exceeded $200,000 in each of those two years.
	
	
	The evidence also was that in the years ended 30 June 2005 to 30 June 2009 the appellant received the benefit of payments made by IFTCO on his behalf, in satisfaction of school fees totalling $99,594 and rent totalling $192,647. The appellant argued in relation to those payments that the Crown had not excluded the reasonable possibility that those payments were made by way of loan to him or by way of distributions from the Pratten Family Trust.
	
	
	There was no evidence that the payments into the personal account or in relation to the school fees and rent were made other than following a request by the appellant of BDO Vanuatu or PKF Vanuatu for funds. To the extent that on some occasions, in relation to the payment requests for the school fees and rent, there was reference to “loans” or “advances”, that evidence was inconsistent with the moneys being paid by way of distributions from the trust. The intercepted conversations and the other evidence to which we have referred overwhelmingly support the conclusion that the funds paid to or at the direction of the appellant were funds of CPI.
	
	
	In the circumstances, as we have said, the question for the jury was whether those payments were made or might reasonably have been made by way of loan, as some of the contemporaneous documents suggest and as the appellant maintained in the recorded conversations, although not always with much confidence that the Commissioner of Taxation would accept that to have been the position.
	
	
	There are several matters which the jury was entitled to take into account in addressing this question. First, there was no evidence of the making of any agreements for loan or of the terms of any such agreements. Secondly, taken at face value the appellant’s various statements suggest that the terms of any arrangements were at best vague as to the time for repayment and uncertain as to whether any interest was payable on the outstanding moneys. Thirdly, the appellant had not been keeping records of when and in what amounts the so-called loans had been made to him. That he had not done so was consistent with his not being under any obligation to repay the moneys advanced or to pay interest on them. Fourthly, the fact that the appellant did not before 2009 keep any systematic record of expenses paid with such moneys, or claim that any of them were deductible, other than in tax returns lodged in September 2009, is consistent with the funds being receipts which he did not treat as taxable, not because they were not income but because they were not to be declared as income. Finally, the evidence did not show that there had been any loan repayments by the appellant to CPI at any time before December 2008 when the search warrants were executed.
	
	
	More significantly, there were two documents which lead us to conclude that on the whole of the evidence it was amply open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the moneys to which we have referred were not paid on the basis that they were loans which had to be repaid. They may sometimes have been called loans but that was not the reality. They were paid and received as the appellant’s share of the profits of CPI.
	
	
	Those documents are communications from the appellant. The first is an email to his business partner, Mr Stephenson, dated 19 December 2007 (6/32). It was sent at a time when the appellant was proposing to fly the helicopter to Vanuatu. It is to be recalled that the helicopter was purchased in June 2005 from funds lent to the appellant by CPI and paid directly from the IFTCO account to the Canadian seller (6/6-11). The email contains a statement of the appellant’s testamentary intentions, addressing the possibility of an air accident. It included the following:
	


“If anything happens to me by way of craaaasssshhhhhhh! - please make sure;

…

… Please value my piece of the business and take it or sell it - and put the moneys in the same for them - and to look after my mother $1,500 a month for the rest of her life.

If you decide to buy my bit of the biz out - pay off over 10 or 15 years to say, lucille is 21.

The old company’s moneys into the trust etc

Sell the helicopter (say $220,000), the boat (say $220,000 as well) the Hardware in Stroud say $450,000).

The NRMA insurance - my $100,000 deposit etc for RGIB be paid into AB trust with all the other money.

Take $250,000 for yourself.

Pay my brother $150,000 + when my Mum dies he will get half the house from my Mum - put other half in trust for the girls.

Pay Sarah $250,000.

Pay $1,000 a month to danielle for as long as [she] has Juliette.

…

… The vanautau [sic] stuff will be taken care of - farm and local properties - business interests etc, here and these should all be sold and any money kept offshore for when the girls are older. Should earn a fair bit of interest - they might decide to live o/s anyway so money can stay offshore.”


	
	This email treats the various assets and properties as owned by the appellant. Most significantly, it makes no mention of any obligation to repay moneys advanced either to enable the purchase of those assets or by payment into the St George account or of the appellant’s expenses. The reference to the “vanautau stuff” is reasonably to be understood as being to the properties owned by PPI, the nominee company incorporated in Vanuatu. To the extent that the jury might have had a doubt as to whether the email left open the possibility that there were loan liabilities of the appellant to CPI which might be discharged from the proceeds of sale of the properties owned by PPI, any such doubt would have been dispelled by the next communication.
	
	
	On 24 September 2008 the appellant sent an email to a financier, New Holland Finance, together with a completed finance application. The scanned copy of the financial application contained a handwritten statement of the appellant’s assets and their value and of his liabilities and their value (5/44). That statement referred to properties at Paddington and Woolloomooloo and included the additional statements “I have several properties. Do you want me to list them all?” and “+ approx $20 million other property”. It also has the word “nil” written three times beside the entries for liabilities owing in respect of property, liabilities by way of bank overdraft, and liabilities owing by way of loan. It concludes by recording that the appellant’s total liabilities are “nil personally”.
	
	
	The email stated (5/36):
	


“My financials are limited to my Group Certificate - I am an employee of RGIB Insurance Broking Pty Ltd and am just starting to operate my farm enterprise as a business unit thus, I do not expect any income until later in this financial year.

I have not finalised my current accounts for my tax year as I’m currently reviewing my personal affairs in respect of trusts and family matters concerning my estate should I pass on suffice to say however, my group certificate is as will be my tax statement for this year.

I note you require a signed copy of my personal assets and liabilities, a copy is attached herewith taken from my original application (unfortunately the scanned quality id very poor) - there is not enough room on it to disclose all my assets however, if you would like me to put a full list together I can - the properties I have listed are in Paddington & Woolloomooloo in Sydney but, I also have properties in the Hunter region, my farm, some commercial properties etc as well as overseas - I estimate a combined value of appx $20m.

I have no debt - hence I will have tax problem this year for the farm’s operations because it will turn a profit and I have only very few expenses. The tractor lease will be a 100% tax deductible expense.”


	
	In the face of this evidence the jury was well able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at least $200,000 of the payments made to the appellant’s personal account in the years ended 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2004 as well as the payments made for school fees and rent were made to him or at his request from funds of CPI and that those payments were not made by way of loan but by way of distribution of the profits of that company. It also was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was well aware that these payments were income in his hands that was required to be disclosed in the tax returns for the years in which it was received. Having considered the transcript of evidence and documents placed before this Court, we are satisfied that, but for the matter which is the subject of ground 1A, it would not be dangerous to allow the verdict of guilty to stand.
	


Conviction appeal: ground 8


	
	Ground 8 is:
	


“The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence by reason of the inability on the evidence to exclude rational hypotheses consistent with innocence in respect of the financial advantage and by reason of the failure to call a material witness.”


	
	This ground raises two bases on which it is said that the verdicts are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. The first, directed to the question of financial advantage, was not developed in the appellant’s written or oral submissions under this ground. To the extent that it was relevant to ground 7, we have addressed it in that context. The second argument is that there was a miscarriage of justice because of the Crown’s failure to call Mr Kym Butler as a witness in its case. It will be recalled that Mr Butler audited the financial statements of CPI.
	
	
	It is for the Crown prosecutor to determine the witnesses that the Crown will call in proof of guilt, subject at all times to the overriding principle that the Crown case must be presented according to the procedures and standards of a fair trial so as to accord fairness to the accused: see Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; 152 CLR 657 at 664 where Deane J observed:
	


“Whether or not their names appear on the back of the indictment or information, all witnesses whose testimony is necessary for the presentation of the whole picture, to the extent that it can be presented by admissible and available evidence, should be called by the Crown unless valid reason exists for refraining from calling a particular witness or witnesses, such as that the interests of justice would be prejudiced rather than served by the calling of an unduly large number of witnesses to establish a particular point.”


	
	The Crown’s failure to call a witness who was able to give relevant and admissible evidence concerning the central facts and events upon which the prosecution is based may be productive of such unfairness that, when viewed objectively in the context of the trial as a whole, results in a substantial miscarriage of justice: R v Apostilides [1984] HCA 38; 154 CLR 363 at 575, 577-578 (per curiam). Consideration of the questions whether a witness should have been called and whether the failure to call that witness has occasioned a miscarriage of justice can be determined only by reference to what is shown to be the significance of the witness’ evidence to the issues at trial, the witness’ credibility and reliability and any explanation of the Crown for not calling the witness: Whitehorn at 666.
	
	
	The possibility that Mr Butler might be able to give relevant evidence because of his association with CPI was suggested by defence counsel in the cross-examination of Federal Agent Walker on day 27 of the trial (10/1396-1397). The officer agreed that he was aware that Mr Butler was involved in some way with auditing CPI’s accounts. Having reviewed the brief of evidence in relation to Mr Butler he gave evidence in re-examination that it did not show whether he was the auditor of CPI (10/1405-1406). He also confirmed in cross-examination that he had not obtained a statement from Mr Butler or subpoenaed any documents that might have been in his possession. Defence counsel did not seek to explore with the officer in cross-examination the evidence Mr Butler might have been able to give or the records he may have been able to produce.
	
	
	In re-examination Federal Agent Walker gave evidence that the reason he had not contacted Mr Butler was because “he was a person of interest relating to these investigations in Vanuatu” and, in addition, that when the appellant had been arrested in September 2010 and was given the opportunity to contact a solicitor, he nominated Mr Butler (10/1406). Before that evidence was given in re-examination, the Crown prosecutor informed the trial judge, in the absence of the jury, that defence counsel was aware of each of those matters at the time he cross-examined Federal Agent Walker. Defence counsel did not suggest that the position was otherwise.
	
	
	There was no formal request by defence counsel at that time, or at any other time before the Crown closed its case, that the Crown call Mr Butler as a witness or that he be made available to the defence for cross-examination. Nor did defence counsel identify any basis upon which it was claimed that Mr Butler was a material witness, or the evidence he might give, in order that the question whether he should be called by the Crown could be considered and an informed decision made by the Crown prosecutor as to whether it was necessary to do so in order to discharge his duty.
	
	
	Mr Butler was also referred to in the cross-examination of Mr Barns, an officer of the Australian Taxation Office, on day 30 of the trial. Mr Barns agreed that he had come across Mr Butler’s name in the course of his taxation audit of the affairs of the appellant but was unable to confirm that he was the auditor of CPI (10/1588). In the defence case the accounts of CPI, which were audited by Mr Butler, were tendered as business records of RGIB (10/1629-1631).
	
	
	In his closing address, the only comment of defence counsel concerning Mr Butler was that the jurors could not know what he might have said concerning the entries in the CPI financial statements (10/1911). Otherwise counsel relied upon the financial reports as indicating Mr Butler’s view that the appellant was one of CPI’s major debtors in an amount of $2.5m. In the summing up, the jurors were instructed at [168] (1/83) that in deciding whether the Crown had proved its case, they were entitled to take into account that there was no evidence from Mr Butler, although they were not to guess what he might have given evidence about were he called as a witness.
	
	
	In the argument on appeal it was not suggested by the appellant that Mr Butler was not called by the Crown for tactical reasons or to gain any impermissible forensic advantage. Nor was it submitted that he should have been interviewed by the Australian Federal Police during the course of the trial and a statement obtained from him in order that some proper assessment might have been made of the relevance of any evidence he may have been able to give. Rather, it was submitted that the Crown should have called him notwithstanding any reservations they had concerning his reliability because he might have given material evidence bearing upon whether the disputed amounts were income.
	
	
	That submission does not squarely address whether Mr Butler was a witness who was able to give relevant and admissible evidence concerning a central issue in the trial. On the face of it he was not. Mr Butler expressed audit opinions on the CPI financial statements. The significant issue to which those statements were relevant was whether, as they recorded, the appellant owed money to CPI in respect of loans made to him over a number of years. Whether those payments were made by way of loan was not something about which Mr Butler could give direct and admissible, as distinct from hearsay evidence. He was not a director or executive of CPI and the evidence at trial did not otherwise suggest he had personal knowledge of matters relevant to that issue. Nor could he give evidence of the content of any document that he may have seen in the course of any audit.
	
	
	In these circumstances the appellant has not demonstrated that Mr Butler was a witness who could have given evidence which was significant to the resolution of the matters in issue and that as a result of his not being called there was a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Ground 8 should be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	We make the following orders:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction is allowed.
	
	
	The appellant’s convictions are quashed.
	
	
	There be a new trial of the appellant.

2764242,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Ching Kwan Ho [2014] NSWSC 886,"Judgment

1This is an application under s 17 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) for a restraining order. Under s 17, a court with proceeds jurisdiction must order that the property not be disposed of or dealt with by any person if a Proceeds of Crime Authority applies for the order and, as here, a person has been convicted of an indictable offence, that the affidavit requirements in s 17(3) have been met and if the court is satisfied that the authorised officer who made the affidavit holds the suspicion stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.

2In the present case, the deponent of the affidavit is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 338 of the Proceeds of Crime Act. He has identified that the defendant was charged with one count of dealing with property to the value of $100,000 Australian or more suspected of being proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.9(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a period of three months' imprisonment. 

3The deponent has annexed to his affidavit a copy of the statement of facts prepared by a Federal agent involved in the investigation of the offence by the defendant. He deposes to a conversation where he asked the Federal agent if he was the officer in charge of the investigation, if he was the author of the statement of facts and whether the contents of the statement of facts were correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. In each case, the agent answered in the affirmative.

4I am satisfied, from the other material referred to in the affidavit and annexed to it, that the suspicion held by the deponent of the affidavit concerning the monies deposited into the Fourex account is a suspicion held on reasonable grounds. 

5I note that under s 26(4) of the Act the court is required to consider the application without notice being given, if the responsible authority requests the court to do so. The applicant is a responsible authority and has so requested. 

6In those circumstances, I make the orders in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the draft order provided to me.

7I stand the proceedings over before the Common Law Registrar on 7 October 2014.

		03 July 2014",2014-06-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764247,Valdemar Ian Valder v The State of New South Wales [2014] NSWSC 876,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: By Amended Statement of Claim filed 16 October 2012, the plaintiff, Valdemar Ian Valder, sues for damages allegedly arising from the negligence of a member of the police force for whom the defendant, the State of New South Wales (the State), is vicariously liable. 

2The detail of the conduct of the police said to give rise to negligence is complicated in the detail, but in relatively short compass at a general level. Further, the facts from which it is said liability arises are uncontroversial. 

Facts

3The plaintiff was charged with shoplifting and prosecuted in the Local Court. A further charge of common assault was preferred and prosecuted at the same time. 

4The learned Magistrate convicted the plaintiff of each offence charged and fined the plaintiff $500 for each of the alleged offences. 

5From that conviction and sentence, the plaintiff appealed on all grounds to the District Court. The District Court proceedings were heard in Parramatta before Judge Bennett DCJ, who confirmed the conviction and quashed the sentences imposed, sentencing the plaintiff to a good behaviour bond under s 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in relation to both of the offences. The bond was entered in the District Court and commenced on 18 September 2012. 

6The conditions of the bond were that the plaintiff must be of good behaviour; appear before the court; and accept certain conditions relating to residential address and notification of any change therein. 

7From the sentence imposed by Judge Bennett DCJ, the plaintiff sought to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. There was no capacity to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and, at some other stage, it seems, although there is little evidence in relation to it, the plaintiff sought prerogative relief in the Court of Appeal. 

8Whatever be the ultimate nature of the proceedings and appeals or review that were sought, the District Court sentence remains extant and has not been set aside or quashed. 

9The negligence arises from the conduct of the District Court proceedings referred to above. An interlocutory order of the District Court was that any evidence upon which the plaintiff relied in the all grounds appeal to the District Court should be served on the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) by close of business 14 September 2012. 

10On Monday, 17 September 2012, the plaintiff attended at the police station at Parramatta and there conversed with the officer on duty, BJ Wilcox. The terms of the conversation are in evidence. It is appropriate for me to repeat the terms of the conversation to which the plaintiff has attested:

""I arrived at the police station at around ten to nine on Monday, on the day, and I walking (sic) to the counter. There was one police officer with the badge, the name badge, on his body. 

I had a number of documents which was going to be my evidence in the Court of Appeal in Parramatta. I had that envelope sealed and addressed to the DPP, Parramatta Police Station. I had a brief exchange of words with the officer. I said, ""I have given an order to give this material to the DPP."" I even opened the envelope and showed him the paperwork. He initially said, ""Okay"", and after a few seconds, ""I am not going to give it to them."" I didn't want to be involved in any discussion. It would not be wise or safe. So I said, ""It is your problem now"" and left the envelope with the officer and I walked out.""

11From the foregoing evidence, and statements made from the bar table by the plaintiff, it appears that the plaintiff, in the mistaken belief that the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Police Prosecutor were one and the same body, attended the police station to serve the Police Prosecutor in circumstances where the direction was to serve the Director of Public Prosecutions. 

12From the evidence, and the explanation given from the bar table, it seems that the plaintiff told the officer on duty that it was necessary for the plaintiff to serve these documents on the DPP and he was serving them on the police so they could deliver them to the DPP. This was done in the mistaken belief that the DPP had an office at the Parramatta Police Station. 

13The police officer replied ""Okay"", as is attested to above. A proper understanding of that conversation, as explained, seems to be that the police officer was acknowledging that he understood the nature of the request that was being made. The plaintiff then disclosed the nature of the documents that were contained in the envelope to the police officer, at which stage the police officer made it clear that he would not or could not deliver the documents to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

14I consider that to be a proper explanation for the conversation that occurred between the plaintiff and the police officer at Parramatta.

15At the time that the documents were delivered to the police station, the time for service of the documents on the DPP had already lapsed. Each of the documents provided to the police, and left with them purportedly for the purpose of delivery to the DPP, were documents of which the plaintiff retained copies. 

16The next day, 18 September 2012, the plaintiff appeared before Judge Bennett DCJ at the hearing of the all grounds appeal. The plaintiff sought to rely upon the documents, copy of which had been left with the police. 

17His Honour declined to allow the plaintiff to rely on those documents. The content and nature of the documents, a copy of which, presumably, is still retained by the plaintiff, have not been adduced in evidence in these proceedings. The Court, as presently constituted, is unaware of the nature of the documents and whether they would or could have any effect on the conviction that was confirmed or the nature of the sentence imposed. 

18These are civil proceedings. There is an overwhelming inference that the documents, in the possession of the plaintiff and not produced to the Court in these proceedings, would not assist the plaintiff's case in these proceedings. 

19Essentially, the plaintiff's case depends upon the allegation that the police officer owed the plaintiff a duty to deliver the documents on his behalf, a breach of which duty gave rise to damage. The damage is the ultimate conviction in the District Court at the all grounds appeal hearing and the consequences of that conviction on the plaintiff. 

Duty of Care

20In Australia, at least, foreseeability is not the only determining factor in ascertaining whether the defendant, the State of New South Wales, has a duty of care. In the foregoing, by referring to the State, it must be understood that I am referring to the police for whom the State is vicariously liable. The vicarious liability of the State for the conduct of members of the police, in a claim such as this, is not in issue in these proceedings. 

21In Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59; (2001) 207 CLR 562, the High Court said:

""[42] The argument was conducted upon the basis that it was foreseeable that harm of the kind allegedly suffered by the appellants might result from want of care on the part of those who investigated the possibility that the children had been sexually abused. But the fact that it is foreseeable, in the sense of being a real and not far-fetched possibility, that a careless act or omission on the part of one person may cause harm to another does not mean that the first person is subject to a legal liability to compensate the second by way of damages for negligence if there is such carelessness, and harm results. If it were otherwise, at least two consequences would follow. First, the law would subject citizens to an intolerable burden of potential liability, and constrain their freedom of action in a gross manner. Secondly, the tort of negligence would subvert many other principles of law, and statutory provisions, which strike a balance of rights and obligations, duties and freedoms. A defendant will only be liable, in negligence, for failure to take reasonable care to prevent a certain kind of foreseeable harm to a plaintiff, in circumstances where the law imposes a duty to take such care"" (per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ). 

22The common law of Australia requires not only foreseeability, but the determination of a separate question as to whether the law imposes a duty, for which question there is no one precise formula: Sullivan v Moody at [48], citing Professor Fleming. The High Court dealt further with the determination of existence of such a duty in Sullivan v Moody in the following passage:

""[50] Different classes of case give rise to different problems in determining the existence and nature or scope, of a duty of care. Sometimes the problems may be bound up with the harm suffered by the plaintiff, as, for example, where its direct cause is the criminal conduct of some third party. Sometimes they may arise because the defendant is the repository of a statutory power or discretion. Sometimes they may reflect the difficulty of confining the class of persons to whom a duty may be owed within reasonable limits. Sometimes they may concern the need to preserve the coherence of other legal principles, or of a statutory scheme which governs certain conduct or relationships. The relevant problem will then become the focus of attention in a judicial evaluation of the factors which tend for or against a conclusion, to be arrived at as a matter of principle. In Donoghue v Stevenson, for example, Lord Buckmaster, in dissent, was concerned that, if the manufacturer in that case was liable, apart from contract or statute, to a consumer, then a person who negligently built a house might be liable, at any future time, to any person who suffered injury in consequence; a concern which later cases showed to have been far from fanciful. The problem which has caused so much difficulty in relation to the extent of tortious liability in respect of negligently constructed buildings was not only foreseeable, but foreseen, in the seminal case on the law of negligence.

[51] In Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office, Lord Diplock said:

""...[T]he judicial development of the law of negligence rightly proceeds by seeking first to identify the relevant characteristics that are common to the kinds of conduct and relationship between the parties which are involved in the case for decision and the kinds of conduct and relationships which have been held in previous decisions of the courts to give rise to a duty of care"".

[52] Conversely, conduct and relationships may have been held not to give rise to a duty of care, and the reasons for that holding may provide an important guide to the solution of the problem in a new case.

[53] Developments in the law of negligence over the last 30 or more years reveal the difficulty of identifying unifying principles that would allow ready solution of novel problems. Nonetheless, that does not mean that novel cases are to be decided by reference only to some intuitive sense of what is ""fair"" or ""unfair"". There are cases, and this is one, where to find a duty of care would so cut across other legal principles as to impair their proper application and thus lead to the conclusion that there is no duty of care of the kind asserted.

[54] The present cases can be seen as focusing as much upon the communication of information by the respondents to the appellants and to third parties as upon the competence with which examinations or other procedures were conducted. The core of the complaint by each appellant is that he was injured as a result of what he, and others, were told. At once, then, it can be seen that there is an intersection with the law of defamation which resolves the competing interests of the parties through well-developed principles about privilege and the like. To apply the law of negligence in the present case would resolve that competition on an altogether different basis. It would allow recovery of damages for publishing statements to the discredit of a person where the law of defamation would not.

[55] More fundamentally, however, these cases present a question about coherence of the law. Considering whether the persons who reported their suspicions about each appellant owed that appellant a duty of care must begin from the recognition that those who made the report had other responsibilities. A duty of the kind alleged should not be found if that duty would not be compatible with other duties which the respondents owed.
...
[62] The statutory scheme that formed the background to the activities of the present respondents was, relevantly, a scheme for the protection of children. It required the respondents to treat the interests of the children as paramount. Their professional or statutory responsibilities involved investigating and reporting upon, allegations that the children had suffered, and were under threat of, serious harm. It would be inconsistent with the proper and effective discharge of those responsibilities that they should be subjected to a legal duty, breach of which would sound in damages, to take care to protect persons who were suspected of being the sources of that harm. The duty for which the appellants contend cannot be reconciled satisfactorily, either with the nature of the functions being exercised by the respondents, or with their statutory obligation to treat the interests of the children as paramount. As to the former, the functions of examination, and reporting, require, for their effective discharge, an investigation into the facts without apprehension as to possible adverse consequences for people in the position of the appellants or legal liability to such persons. As to the latter, the interests of the children, and those suspected of causing their harm, are diverse, and irreconcilable. That they are irreconcilable is evident when regard is had to the case in which examination of a child alleged to be a victim of abuse does not allow the examiner to form a definite opinion about whether the child has been abused, only a suspicion that it may have happened. The interests of the child, in such a case, would favour reporting that the suspicion of abuse has not been dispelled; the interests of a person suspected of the abuse would be to the opposite effect.""


23Even where a relationship of the kind that gives rise to a duty of care is established, such a duty does not necessarily give rise to the ability to receive compensation for all losses occasioned. A common law duty of care does not apply to compensate injury, loss or damage of all kinds, simply because it exists in relation to one kind. In Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman [1985] HCA 41; (1985) 157 CLR 424 at 487, Brennan J (as his Honour then was) said:

""[27] The corollary is that a postulated duty of care must be stated in reference to the kind of damage that a plaintiff has suffered and in reference to the plaintiff or a class of which the plaintiff is a member.

[28] It is impermissible to postulate a duty of care to avoid one kind of damage - say, personal injury - and, finding the defendant guilty of failing to discharge that duty, to hold him liable for the damage actually suffered that is of another and independent kind - say, economic loss. Not only may the respective duties differ in what is required to discharge them; the duties may be owed to different persons or classes of persons. That is not to say that a plaintiff who suffers damage of some kind will succeed or fail in an action to recover damages according to his classification of the damage he suffered. The question is always whether the defendant was under a duty to avoid or prevent that damage, but the actual nature of the damage suffered is relevant to the existence and extent of any duty to avoid or prevent it.""

24It is also instructive to recite two pages from the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil [2000] HCA 61; (2000) 205 CLR 254. In Modbury Triangle, Gleeson CJ said:

""[14] In some cases, where there is a problem as to the existence and measure of legal responsibility, it is useful to begin by identifying the nature of the harm suffered by a plaintiff, for which a defendant is said to be liable.""

25To similar effect is the statement of Hayne J:

""[105] In cases such as the present, where the extent of the relevant duty is not clear, it is useful to begin by considering the damage which the plaintiff suffered, and the particular want of care which is alleged against the defendant. Asking then whether that damage, caused by that want of care, resulted from the breach of a duty which the defendant owed the plaintiff, may reveal more readily the scope of the duty upon which the plaintiff's allegations of breach and damage must depend."" 

26In this case, the damage for which Mr Valder seeks an award is the damage associated with the confirmation of the guilty verdict and the inability, it is said, to be admitted as a legal practitioner in New South Wales and/or to continue as a financial planner in New South Wales. The want of care, which is alleged to give rise to the damage, is the failure of the police officer to deliver to the Director of Public Prosecution's office the documents delivered to the police as earlier stated. 

27Given that the claim against the State of New South Wales, which is vicariously liable for the actions of the police, is a claim in negligence, the provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002 apply. It is unnecessary to decide whether the provisions of s 5B of the Civil Liability Act preclude a claim for negligence in the circumstances that Mr Valder alleges occurred. I am prepared to accept, without deciding, that s 5B of the Civil Liability Act does not preclude such a cause of action. 

28While I consider that the burden of taking steps to avoid the risk of harm in a matter such as this would involve police taking on the responsibility for the delivery of papers in all criminal conduct and such a burden would be extremely onerous, I am also, for present purposes, prepared to accept, without deciding, that the onerousness of the burden does not impact upon the provisions of s 5B(2) and s 5B(1) of the Civil Liability Act in a way that precluded the conduct from a claim for negligence. 

29However, the provisions of s 5D of the Civil Liability Act dealing with factual causation and the scope of liability pose significantly greater difficulties for Mr Valder. 

30The test described in s 5D(a) requires the Court to deal with the factual connection between the alleged negligence or breach of relevant duty and the occurrence of the particular harm. It is otherwise described as the ""but for"" test of causation and requires the plaintiff to establish that he would not have suffered the harm of which he complains ""but for"" the defendant's negligence: Strong v Woolworths Limited [2012] HCA 5; (2012) 246 CLR 182; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak [2009] HCA 48; (2009) 239 CLR 420. 

31As a consequence of the test in s 5D(1)(a) of the Civil Liability Act, the plaintiff must prove, to the civil standard of balance of probability, that but for the failure of the police to deliver the documents to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the damage would not have occurred. The evidence before the Court, and any inference that may properly be drawn therefrom, does not satisfy that test. The failure to deliver the documents to the DPP did not cause the harm. 

32Mr Valder had the opportunity to explain to the District Court that the documents were delivered to the police on 17 September 2012 and to tender, subject to procedural requirements as to timing, the documents before the District Court. The District Court did not allow the tender. 

33Further, Mr Valder has not provided the material to the Court in these proceedings and the Court is not in a position to be able to determine that, if the material were delivered, tendered and utilised by the District Court, the result of the proceedings would have been any different from that which occurred. 

34As well as failing to satisfy the factual causation requirement in s 5D(1)(a) of the Civil Liability Act, the plaintiff has significant difficulty in satisfying the requirements of s 5(1)(b) of the Civil Liability Act. In my view, it is not appropriate for the scope of the police's liability to extend to the harm caused by the failure to deliver a document, in circumstances where the relationship between the plaintiff and the police and the police and the proceedings to which the documents relate is so tenuous. 

35Further, the test must include the subjective element as to what the plaintiff would have done if the alleged breach of duty had not occurred. This is an issue in which the plaintiff has particular difficulties. Assuming, for the purpose of this discussion, but not deciding, that the police owed a duty of care and breached it by not delivering the document, the plaintiff was aware, and was made aware by the police officer, that the document would not be delivered. 

36As earlier stated in the recital of the evidence, the police officer told the plaintiff that he would not be delivering the document. The plaintiff did nothing in relation to that information. He could have retrieved the envelope and delivered it himself. He chose not to do that. It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine that the failure to deliver the document caused the harm in circumstances where the plaintiff had it in his own hands to deliver the document himself and negate any damage. 

37The plaintiff submits to the Court that the risk of harm associated with the failure to deliver the documents was ""obvious"". Given that the plaintiff is unrepresented, I do not take that as an admission as to the operation of the provisions of s 5G of the Civil Liability Act. In any event, this case does not involve a failure to warn. Nevertheless the plaintiff, to put it in terms of the Civil Liability Act, was warned of the ""obvious risk"" when the police officer made it clear that the documents sought to be delivered would not be. 

38I have assumed, earlier in these reasons, that a duty of care existed. I make it clear that the assumption was for the purpose of dealing with subsequent issues, which were more obvious and more easily shown to deny to the plaintiff any prospect of success in the proceedings. Nevertheless, I should point out that in my view there is no duty of care owed by a police officer to a member of the public to deliver goods or documents to the Director of Public Prosecutions, simply because a request is made. 

39That is not to say that there are not situations in which a police officer owes a duty of care to members of the public. Obviously, police officers, in some circumstances, owe such a duty. One only has to give the example of circumstances where a person is to be arrested. 

40Mr Valder relies upon the assumption of responsibility by the police officer when he said, ""Okay"" on being shown the envelope. As already stated, in my view the evidence does not establish the assumption of a responsibility to deliver, but, rather, an acknowledgement of the nature of the request being made. 

41Even if the initial response were an assumption of responsibility, that assumption was negated by the express statement of the police officer that the document would not be delivered. In this case, the police officer did not assume risk or responsibility for the delivery of the goods. Nor does any risk of harm associated with non-delivery give rise to a cause of action for damages. 

42For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff has not established his cause of action. Nevertheless, I will deal with the issue of damage, but not its assessment. 

43The plaintiff claims damages, being an inability to practice as a legal practitioner or to continue practice as a financial planner and/or an investment advisor. The path to such a claim must travel through the finding of guilt by the District Court. 

44In other words, the plaintiff claims that the confirmation of the guilt of the plaintiff for shoplifting and common assault would deprive the plaintiff of the capacity, sometime in the future, of practising as a legal practitioner and/or continuing his capacity to act as a financial planner or investment planner. 

45There are a number of fundamental problems with such a course. First, the finding of guilt is an order of the court. No material before the Court in these proceedings establishes, or even arguably establishes, that the result of the District Court proceedings would have been different were the documents delivered. The judgment and verdict of the District Court is a verdict of a court of record. The assumption must be that it reflects the law and justice. While the District Court verdict remains extant, it is impermissible for the plaintiff to rely on damages that flow from the assumption that the District Court verdict is wrong. 

46Moreover, no evidence has been put to the Court to establish whether a shoplifting and common assault charge would be such as to disentitle the plaintiff from practising as a legal practitioner (were he otherwise qualified) or a financial planner (assuming that is currently the situation). 

47In short, the plaintiff has not established, even as a matter of principle or as a matter of fact, that damages (whatever their calculation) arise from the conduct of the police and can, as a matter of vicarious liability, be sheeted home to the State of New South Wales. 

48For all of the above reasons, the plaintiff has failed to establish a cause of action or damage arising from the impugned conduct of the police. 

49The Court makes the following orders:

(1)Judgment for the defendant;

(2)The plaintiff shall pay the defendant's costs of and incidental to the proceedings, as agreed or assessed;

(3)The parties have liberty within 14 days of the publication of this judgment to apply for a different or special costs order by submission of no more than three (3) pages and any party affected by any such application shall, within a further 14 days from receipt of the application, have liberty to file a response thereto, again by submission of no more than three (3) pages;

(4)Proceedings otherwise dismissed.

2764254,Rail Corporation New South Wales v King [2014] NSWCA 207,"Judgment
1McCOLL JA:  I agree with Basten JA's reasons and the orders his Honour proposes.  I also agree with Leeming JA's observations.
2BASTEN JA:  At about 3am on the morning of Saturday, 2 September 2006, Shane John King (the respondent in this Court and the plaintiff at trial) fell on to the rail tracks at Mortdale Station in south-western Sydney.  About 30 seconds after the fall, a train arrived, causing him severe injuries, particularly to his left leg which was lying across one rail track.  He sued the appellant (Rail Corporation New South Wales, also known as ""RailCorp"") as the body responsible for operating the train.  (RailCorp is a body corporate created by the Transport Administration Act 1988 (NSW), s 4(1), its principal object being ""to deliver safe and reliable railway passenger services in New South Wales in an efficient, effective and financially responsible manner"": s 5(1)(a).)  Damages were agreed in an amount of $1.3 million, and the matter went to trial on the questions of the liability of RailCorp in negligence and the contributory negligence of the respondent.  The trial judge (Davies J) found the appellant liable and assessed contributory negligence at 50%.  He gave judgment for the respondent accordingly: King v Rail Corp NSW [2013] NSWSC 241.
3The primary case against the appellant was based on vicarious liability for the negligence of its driver.  Although there was no pleading of direct liability, there was a finding of breach on the part of RailCorp with respect to the instructions issued to drivers.  RailCorp appealed against the finding of negligence, including vicarious and direct breaches of duty.  Its primary case was that even if the driver were slow to respond, a response within a reasonable time would not have avoided the accident; hence the plaintiff did not establish that any lack of reasonable care caused the accident.  Perhaps surprisingly, the respondent appealed against the finding of contributory negligence.
4For the reasons explained below, the finding of negligence was not supportable on the evidence and accordingly the appeal must be allowed and the judgment set aside.  It is not necessary to revisit the finding of contributory negligence.
Breach and causation5The plaintiff's pleading on which the case went to trial stated at par 3:
""The Plaintiff was on railway tracks owned and operated by the Defendant who had a duty to take all necessary precautions to prevent injury to persons on those tracks.""
6This inept and inaccurate pleading was not amended, but the matter was dealt with on the basis that the defendant (RailCorp) was vicariously liable for the failure of the train driver to take reasonable care to avoid running over the plaintiff, who was lying across the track.  That the driver did take steps, by applying his emergency brakes and sounding the horn, is undisputed.  In fact, with the assistance of logging devices on the train and CCTV on the station, what is known and what could have been done was able to be recorded and calculated with great precision.  Thus, the evidence demonstrated that the emergency brakes were applied 6.21 seconds before the point of impact, when the train was 59 metres from the point of impact and travelling at 11.9 m/sec.  In noting these matters, the experts duly recorded that the equipment was subject to a margin of error.  With respect to the recording of speed, this was noted to be 2%.
7Needless to say, there were far higher levels of imprecision in identifying what it was ""reasonable"" to expect of the driver.  Two distances, however, were able to be identified with some precision.  The first was the point at which the driver had a direct line of sight which would have allowed him (in theory) to see the respondent on the track: that was identified as 141 metres.  Secondly, knowing the speed of the train and the effect of the emergency brake, the experts were able to calculate the ""critical point"" at which the emergency brake had to be engaged in order to stop the train before it hit the respondent.  That was a distance variously calculated by the experts as 105 or 102 metres.  Given the margins for error with the various calculations, the difference was not significant.
8A third calculation, based on the speed of the train (which was at the time braking) and the distance between the first point at which the driver had a line of sight and the ""critical point"" for the application of the emergency brakes, was the time for the train to cover that distance, a period of approximately three seconds.  That was the period within which the driver had to react and apply the emergency brake, in order to avoid the accident.
9It was the assessment of what could reasonably be expected of the driver in that period of three seconds upon which the finding of vicarious liability depended.  From the days when courts would scoff at the supposed expertise of those who called themselves experts in traffic accident reconstruction (see, for example, Weal v Bottom (1966) 40 ALJR 436) modern expertise relies upon mechanical engineering and psychological studies (and will no doubt shortly incorporate neuroscience).  Suffice it to say that the elements of a response to imminent danger have been broken down into a number of stages which may be identified as (i) detection of danger; (ii) deciding how to respond; (iii) physical response, and (iv) mechanical response.
10The fourth element was excluded from the calculation of the times involved.  That was no doubt because the possible time taken for the emergency braking system to respond, once activated, was allowed for within the calculation of the known effect, being the time from the point of engagement in fact to the time at which the train came to a halt.
11The second two elements were addressed in a report prepared by Mr Jeffrey Muttart.  He identified a ""perception-reaction"" time of 0.8 seconds and a ""movement time"" of 0.35 seconds, thus giving a ""full brake response time"" of 1.15 seconds.
12Mr Muttart did not attempt to calculate the 'detection' time.  He made that clear in a number of passages in his report.  Thus, at p 11 he stated:
""I have been asked to limit the scope of my analysis to the driver's brake-response time.  Hence, I will not discuss the ability of a driver or observer to interpret that object or identify that object.  Instead, I have been asked to assume that the object was immediately identified.""
13He set out his analysis, commencing with the following propositions at p 12:
""It is impossible for a crash reconstructionist to offer an expert opinion regarding the ability to avoid a crash without addressing the following three steps.  Without a thorough analysis of each of these steps, any resulting opinion has to be speculative.  Also, each opinion for each step should be based upon how people have responded in similar situations, in research and in real-life crash and near crash situations.
1. At what point in time or distance does the pedestrian become easily identifiable (conspicuous)?
2. What is the average and range of normal responses for this situation, after the hazard is identified, in step 1?  ...
3. Given the speed and the time remaining (subtract 2 from 1 above) was this crash scenario avoidable and, if so, by what portion of the population?""
I have been asked to assume that the pedestrian was immediately discernible. ...""
14Mr Muttart set out (at p 14) a diagram identifying the four stages in the analysis referred to above.  It is clear from the diagram that what he described as the ""perception-response times"" did not include the phase identified by the word ""detect"".  The diagram was followed by the following statement:
""My analysis should be applied to a point after the pedestrian was easily discernible.  The reader must understand that all perception-response-related research has three things in common.  The hazard was (1) easily identifiable, (2) it posed an immediate hazard, and (3) the driver initiated an emergency response.  Hence, no investigator or expert should apply a perception-response time until all three are true.  Drivers do not implement an emergency response maneuver for an undefined flicker, or blob. Instead, drivers typically restrain from responding in an emergency manner until they can discern the pattern of the object ahead.  I have been asked to assume that the pedestrian was easily identifiable (a distinct and recognizable pattern) as a pedestrian once within the driver's sightline.""
15The appellant's case was that taking these distinctions into account, the 1.15 second period identified by Mr Muttart as a reasonable perception response time did not include the period required to detect and identify the danger ahead.  As the period from the moment the respondent came within the driver's line of sight to the critical point at which the emergency brake had to be engaged was three seconds, and the reaction response time was 1.15 seconds, the driver had only 1.85 seconds to observe something on the track ahead and identify it as a danger.
16The trial judge made a critical finding at [45], noting of the driver:
""If he did not observe the object on the line when it was first within his line of sight or very soon after (no more than two seconds) I consider that he was in breach of his duty in not so observing the object.  In that regard he would not have been keeping a proper lookout.""
17In this passage, the trial judge did not require that the driver identify the ""object"" as a person lying across the track, a point to which it will be necessary to return.  With respect to causation, the appellant relied upon a different proposition.  It submitted that the trial judge allowed the driver two seconds to observe the object: however, in order to avoid the accident, the driver had only 1.85 seconds to observe the object and identify it as a danger which must be avoided at all costs.  Thus, on the judge's own finding, the breach of duty was not causative in the relevant sense, because a reaction at a reasonable time would not have prevented the accident.  This submission should be accepted.
Breach of duty by driver18From the moment that the object on the track came into sight to the point at which the emergency brakes were engaged was about 6.2 secs.  The trial judge held that reasonable care required they be applied in half that time.  However, the trial judge did not in fact require that the driver identify the object on the track as a person, nor did he find that the driver should reasonably have identified him as a person before he in fact did.  That occurred when the respondent, whose body was mainly in the shadow of the platform, moved.  There is no dispute that at that point the driver reacted immediately to apply the emergency brake and sound the horn.  (The horn sounded for more than four seconds before the collision.)  The question was whether he was negligent in not applying the emergency brake immediately he detected something on the rail head.  
19After noting that a collision between a train and an object might derail the train, with serious risk to life and limb, as well as the serious risk of a collision between a train and a person, the reasoning of the judge continued:
""[54] In circumstances where striking a human being was not the only risk but derailment of the train by reason of striking an inanimate object was also a risk, as [the driver] accepted, it seems to me that [the driver] breached his duty of care by not taking emergency action when he first saw the object and did not know what it was.  ...  Whilst striking a human being may have been the greatest risk, derailment of the train was a serious risk, because of injury to passengers and staff, if the object might have been such as to derail the train.
[55] If his vision was limited or impaired because it was dark that was an added reason for erring on the side of caution when he could not discern what the object was.  Further, taking his eyes off the object until he knew what it was also amounted to a breach of his duty of care.""
20The driver had made a statement on 5 August 2009 which was in evidence and included the following paragraphs:
""[25] At about 100 metre from the departure end of Mortdale platform, I noticed an object adjacent to no 2 platform on the line. 
[26] I have come around the corner and about 100 metre from the end of the platform I have noticed an object on the line.  At that stage I had not seen that it was a person.
[27] Where the object was, was in the shadows between the platform edge and the rail head.  The rail head is the top of the rail, and so it was in that area.
[28] It just looked like rubbish on the side of the track.  It was indistinct and I could not see what it was, but it just looked like rubbish....[30] When I got about 50 metre from the object I realised it was a person, as the object moved.
[31] I am concentrating on the end of the platform, and it was the movement of the object that drew my attention back to it.""
(The train log suggested that the driver in fact reacted about 70-80 metres from the respondent: the emergency brake was engaged at 59 metres.)
21The trial judge referred at [28]-[30] to aspects of the cross-examination of the driver, to the following effect:
""Q. You said 'It just looked like rubbish on the side of the track. It was indistinct. I could not see what it was but it just looked like rubbish'? A.  Correct. 
Q.  What does rubbish look like?A.  General litter. 
Q.  This is a human being wearing a back pack. In what way can you suggest it resembled rubbish? A.  I couldn't tell it was a human being wearing a back pack. 
Q.  But we know that it was.  You say you saw it and you thought it looked like rubbish.  I want you to tell us what it was about this human being wearing a back pack which resembled what you would expect rubbish to look like? A.  At the time I did not recognise it to be a human being. 
Q.  I know, but what did you see that made you think it was rubbish? A.  An indistinct shape that I couldn't tell was a human being. 
Q.  What sort of indistinct shape? A.  Just an indistinct shape as I say. Like, there's rubbish around the track all the time. It wasn't anything to be, I noticed to be out of different order.
...
Q.  ... Since you didn't know what it was did it not occur to you that it would be prudent to take some steps so that you could stop if you had to? A.  It didn't occur to me to stop.
Q.  Do you think you should have? A.  My only answer to that is once I realised it was a human being I took the appropriate action.  I can't second guess myself and say that, because I didn't know what it was. My experience is there is a lot of rubbish and litter around the area and I can't keep pulling the train out for just anything. 
Q.  But that is all very well and you say, well, you didn't know it was a human being.  But you didn't know it was just rubbish either, did you? A.  That is correct, I didn't. 
Q.  And since you didn't know it was just rubbish there was a possibility it was a person?A.  I didn't consider that it would be a person.
...
Q.  When you first saw this object on the line, did you only see the part of the object that was on the rail head, or did you see more than that? A. What I saw was really only on the rail head and perhaps in between the tracks.  The shadows itself are from the platform and the station lighting.  I really couldn't see anything in that area between the rail head closest to the platform and the platform itself. ...Q. ... how often would you encounter on the track some form of what you have described as rubbish?  Would it be on a daily basis or weekly or A.  Certainly a daily basis, possibly even every train you get on to, there is always rubbish on the side of the track or in that area.  It's not a rare occurrence; it's a regular, normal occurrence. 
Q.  Do you have to make a judgment about what you are looking at, to see if there is a danger of proceeding, not so much because it might be a human being, but because it might derail the train? A.  Certainly, yes. 
Q.  What about the fact that, in this case, part of the object actually extended across the rail head.  Did that not cause you some concern? A.  I didn't know what that object was. 
Q.  Well, the fact that you didn't know what the object was, ought to have caused you to do something to slow the train down until you did know, shouldn't it? A.  The object that I saw at the time, I ... obviously didn't feel as though it was a risk to either the safety of myself or of the train or the passengers upon the train.""
22The trial judge did not reject the driver's explanation that what he thought he saw on the track was rubbish, nor did he reject the evidence that the driver could not see the respondent (until he moved) because he was in the shadow of the platform.  There was no finding that the respondent's leg could possibly have been identified as something which might derail the train.  The finding that it was not reasonable for the driver to look away (at the end of the platform, being the point at which he was required to stop the train) was unsupportable but probably immaterial.  The finding of breach of duty lay in the driver not engaging the emergency brakes immediately he saw something which he identified as rubbish on the track.  
23The driver gave evidence that he had not been instructed as to what he should do if he saw rubbish on the line.  This finding of breach of duty appears to have turned on the further finding that RailCorp should have instructed its drivers to apply the emergency brakes in those circumstances, which is the element of direct negligence.  In any event, absent instructions requiring him to apply the emergency brakes whenever there was anything on the track which was not clearly identified, a finding of negligence on the part of the driver was to set a standard of care well above that which was reasonable.  Those considerations noted below which support RailCorp's view that no such general instruction was appropriate also support the conclusion that the conduct of the driver was not in breach of the appropriate duty of reasonable care.
24Before leaving the question of breach of duty on the part of the driver, it may be noted that the trial judge commenced his discussion by reference to the circumstances in Public Transport Commission (NSW) v Perry [1977] HCA 32; 137 CLR 107.  The circumstances of that case bore some similarity to the present, in that it involved a collision between a train and a woman who had fallen onto the tracks as a result of an epileptic fit at Lindfield Station.  As the trial judge correctly noted, the issues of legal principle were not relevant in the present circumstances, this case being governed by the terms of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) and not by general law principles relating to injury to a person who might be characterised as a trespasser.  Further, the Court did not make any findings of fact: it merely considered whether a finding of breach of duty was open to the jury (which had found for the plaintiff).  The case was not authority for any relevant principle. 
25However, the trial judge at [50], in setting out a lengthy extract from the joint reasons of Mason and Jacobs JJ in Perry (at 148) emphasised the following passage:
""He made no stronger application of the brake until he positively identified the object as a human being. Only then did he apply the full emergency brake.  ...  It appears to us that the omission of the driver which the jury could regard as showing a lack of reasonable care was his failure to do anything until he positively identified the object as a human body.""
26Although the trial judge was undoubtedly aware that this language did not require him to adopt a similar approach, it was the approach he adopted.  As the facts of Perry revealed, the jury might also have concluded that the driver should have identified the object as a human body before he did.  (He observed the object at a distance of 300 yards; it was broad daylight; although he said he thought it was a large piece of brown paper, it was a woman wearing a white dress with purple stripes.)  The case is of no assistance in the present circumstances.
Direct breach by RailCorp27The trial judge stated at [57]:
""In addition to those breaches on the part of [the driver], I consider that Rail Corp breached its duty of care by not issuing clear instructions to its drivers about the action they should take in circumstances where an object was seen on the track and the driver was not able to discern whether or not it was a human being.  That is not to say that a driver would be obliged in every case that something is seen on the track to apply the emergency brakes with the dangers and inconvenience that that course may well entail.  Since, however, the almost inevitable result of a train striking a human being will be death or serious injury the only reasonable response to the risk, where an object is seen but not identified, is for emergency braking to be applied in an endeavour to avoid striking the unknown object.""
28After reaching that conclusion, the trial judge referred to the evidence (unchallenged) of Mr Stephen Scott, then Acting General Manager of Operations for RailCorp.  Mr Scott provided statistics as to the operation of the City Rail service and noted that drivers were not provided with instructions to apply emergency brakes immediately something was noticed on the line because of (1) safety concerns; (2) adverse impact to service availability, and (3) increased repair and maintenance costs.  Mr Scott stated under the heading ""Safety Concerns"":
""13 Train drivers within the Sydney Metropolitan Network repeatedly report noticing objects on the line such as rubbish and general debris.  This is a very common occurrence and the objects include newspapers, rocks, general rubbish and shopping trolleys.  Drivers have even reported seeing garden settings and ladders on the railway tracks.
14 Every time a train driver applies the emergency brakes, the train stops very suddenly and unexpectedly which has safety implications for the people on board the train. Passengers who are standing could be injured as a result of falling over or even falling down the internal stairs.  Further, special needs passengers including blind, disabled, elderly, children and inattentive or distracted passengers (such as Ipod listeners) are at an increased risk of being injured during emergency braking of the train.
15 The above risks are amplified if the emergency brakes are applied when a train is coming into a station as more passengers will be standing in preparation to alight the train.
16 Having regard to the frequency with which drivers report observing objects on the line together with the high volume of passengers using the Sydney Metropolitan railway (and whose safety is placed at risk during emergency braking), in my opinion the mandating of emergency braking as soon as anything is seen on the line would create an unacceptable level of risk.""
29The trial judge reached the following further conclusions at [61]:
""Mr Scott's evidence was not challenged by the Plaintiff.  In any event, in terms of statements of general principle it can be accepted as common sense and appropriate in ordinary situations.  It may not be appropriate, however, at night time, adjacent to a railway platform, in relation to a train where there were few passengers (as the CCTV makes clear and as the time of the events would strongly suggest) and where the driver could see that an object was across the railhead but did not know what it was.""
30This finding is not consistent with the finding of breach previously made at [57].  To say that the general instruction ""may not be appropriate"" in the set of circumstances identified is insufficient to demonstrate a breach of duty.  A finding that it was unreasonable not to give a specific instruction in those circumstances required attention to the bases of Mr Scott's opinion.  
31No direct breach of duty on the part of RailCorp was identified in the pleadings, nor was the appropriate direction formulated with sufficient precision.  No expert evidence supportive of such a direction was called for the respondent.  Mr Scott was not cross-examined.  A finding of systemic breach of duty by the manager of a large rail network should only be made on a firm evidential basis.  That basis was absent in the present case.  The finding as to the direct breach by RailCorp cannot be sustained.
32This conclusion also undermines the assumption on which the finding of negligence on the part of the driver was based.  If identification of any ""object"" on the line was insufficient to require the engagement of the emergency brake, there was no supportable finding of a breach of duty.  Thus, the appellant is entitled to succeed with the respect to vicarious liability for negligence of the driver, not only on the basis that causation was not established, but also on the basis that there was no breach of duty on his part.
Conclusion33In these circumstances, it is not necessary to address other grounds of appeal nor the cross-appeal.
34The Court should make the following orders:
(1) Allow the appeal and set aside the judgment and orders of Davies J made on 12 April 2013.
(2) In place of those orders,
(i) give judgment for the defendant (RailCorp);(ii) order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs of the trial.
(3) Order that the respondent (Mr King) pay the appellant's costs in this Court.
(4) Grant the respondent a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (NSW) with respect to the costs of the appeal.
35LEEMING JA:  I agree with Basten JA's reasons and proposed orders.  The essential facts were established (subject only to very small measurement errors) by the CCTV footage at the station and the data loggers on the train.  At around 3.08am on the morning of 2 September 2006, Mr King fell onto the tracks beside the No 2 southbound platform at Mortdale station.  He remained there, mostly motionless, facing southwards, away from oncoming trains on that line.  
36The line from Central makes a sweeping left-hand bend into Mortdale station.  A train approached shortly after Mr King fell onto the tracks.  The train was already breaking normally, in order to stop at the station, before Mr King came into the driver's line of sight.  By then, the train had slowed from some 61 km/h to 43 km/h.
37The parties' experts agreed that Mr King first came into a direct line of sight when the driver was 141 metres away, which was about 12.4 seconds before the impact.  It was common ground that (so long as Mr King continued to lie on the track) it was necessary in order to avoid a collision for the emergency brakes to have been applied when the train was 102-105 metres from him, which was between 9.5 and 9.7 seconds before the impact.  That is to say, unless Mr King moved, only if the driver applied the emergency brakes no more than between 2.7 and 2.9 seconds after he came into direct line of sight would the train halt before colliding with him.
38The driver did see Mr King.  The driver applied the emergency brakes some 6.2 seconds before impact.  The driver also applied the horn, continuously, for some 4.4 seconds prior to impact.  Mr King did not move off the tracks.  At the point of impact, the train was travelling at some 6.9 m/s (or 25 km/h).  The train took another 25 metres to stop after hitting Mr King.
39The unchallenged expert evidence was that once Mr King was clearly identifiable, the average person's ""perception-response"" time was 0.8 seconds, while for 85% of the population it was within 1.1 seconds.  The expert (Mr Muttart) said that having detected something, the perception-response time was the time to categorise what was seen and decide to act.  Further, having decided to act, it would take a further 0.35 seconds, on average, to perform the mechanical task of applying the emergency brake.  The consequence is, as Basten JA has explained in more detail, that if Mr King remained on the tracks, a driver with average reaction times had to detect his presence in the early hours of the morning within 1.55 - 1.75 seconds of his coming into direct line of sight if a collision were to be avoided (the sum of 0.8 and 0.35 is 1.15, the difference between 2.7 and 1.15 is 1.55, and the difference between 2.9 and 1.15 is 1.75).  If (as Mr Muttart considered) ""the 85th percentile response time is the threshold typically used to compare normal responses"", then there was even less time once Mr King came into line of sight. 
40It may be accepted that it is a simplification to divide human response into discrete times for ""detection"", ""perception-response"" and ""movement"".  It is highly plausible that there is some overlap between those categories; human sensory perception and reaction is unlikely to be a series of discrete functional steps.  Indeed, as Mr Muttart said, ""At times in real-life the lines between each stage are blurred"".  However, on any view some time must be allowed for the first stage of detection.  The reasoning of the primary judge did not do this.  On the findings of the primary judge, there was no breach of duty by the driver in failing to detect Mr King within 1.55 - 1.75 seconds after he first came into direct line of sight.  That is sufficient to resolve Mr King's primary claim against the appellant based on vicarious liability.  I also agree with Basten JA's rejection of the case based on direct liability.

2764268,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police application re matter 2013/379002 [2014] NSWSC 900,"Judgment
1By summons filed 7 December 2013 the Commissioner of the AFP sought a restraining order and ultimately forfeiture of moneys in two Citigroup accounts.  On 17 December restraining orders in respect of the money were made.
2The Commissioner now applies under s 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) for forfeiture of the money.  Section 49 provides that the court must make an order that the property is forfeited to the Commonwealth if certain conditions set out in this section are met.  Relevantly, those conditions are:  that it is a responsible authority applying, and I find that that is so.  
3Secondly, the restraining order must have been in force for at least six months.  I have already referred to the fact that the restraining order was made on 17 December 2013.  
4The requirement that the court be satisfied that the property - to use a general term - derives from indictable offences or is associated with them, as s 49(1)(c) requires, does not need to be satisfied if no application has been made under Div 3 of Pt 2-1 for the property to be excluded - subs (3).  I am satisfied on the evidence that, although it was indicated at an earlier time that such an application would be made by Knightsbridge North Lawyers, no such application has in fact been made by them.  They have not appeared this morning when called.  
5Finally, the court must be satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons with an interest in the property.  I am satisfied from the affidavit of Trenton Andrew Schmidt sworn 29 January 2014 that all reasonable steps have been taken to identify and notify any person who has or might have an interest in the property.
6In those circumstances, I make orders 1 to 4 contained in the Short Minutes of Order.  I note that there is no order as to costs.  I grant liberty to apply.

2764287,R v Hunter (No 8) [2014] NSWSC 1151,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Defence counsel has applied for a discharge of the whole jury. The application is based on the following exchange between the Crown Prosecutor and the witness, Mr Tory Gardner, in his evidence-in-chief on the afternoon of Tuesday 9 July 2014. The evidence, placed in a little of the proceeding context, is as follows: 

Q. Sorry, he being Paul Hunter? 
A. Yeah, sorry. Paul was walking towards Carlisle Avenue, just yelling stuff out, like what he had previously said, like ""You had better get out of there. I will be back with me brothers and guns,"" and I just wasn't really worried by that stage. I just started walking back to my father's house. 

Q. Right? 
A. And as I've gotten into my dad's house he's just straight in my face? 

Q. Your father? 
A. Yeah, calling me Mary and telling, he said, ""Oh you and your girl Sammi, pack your bags and get out of me house. I don't want youse here any more,"" and I just said to my father, I said, ""I am not going anywhere"". I said, ""Womba"" Paul ""Paul's just said that he's coming back to get ya, and he's known for doing stuff like that. I'm not going anywhere"". 

Q. All right, thank you? 
A. And that's exactly what I said to me dad. I said, ""I'm not going anywhere, like he's known for doing that stuff"".

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Yes, Madam Crown, next question please. 

2In a nutshell, defence counsel submits that the jury heard and must have realised that the witness was stating that, as at the date of the offence alleged, the witness believed that the accused had a reputation for violence, and that the witness conveyed that belief to his father.

3The possibility of the application was not notified to my associate by email until 4.47 PM that afternoon, in accordance with my general request before and during the trial that I be provided with notice of any pending applications or legal issues. 

4The possibility of any such application was not mentioned by defence counsel in the absence of the jury whilst I was sitting yesterday afternoon. The explanation of defence counsel for that state of affairs is that he undoubtedly heard the evidence given, but wished, first, to check the transcript; secondly, to reflect upon the law; and, thirdly, to reflect on the way forward generally. That is an explanation that I accept.

5The evidence founding the application needs to be seen in the context of the other evidence either already called in the trial or foreshadowed in the openings of counsel or on the voir dire.

6The Crown case in a nutshell is that the accused, his brother Wade Hunter, and his cousin Gary Hunter, fatally assaulted the deceased in retaliation for an assault committed by the deceased on the accused with a metal weapon. 

7In her opening, the Crown Prosecutor foreshadowed that there would be evidence that the accused was present at the home of Mr Bernard Douglas, where prohibited drugs were in the habit of being consumed: trial transcript 15.6. It was foreshadowed that, when a confrontation developed outside the home of Mr Douglas, the accused said words to the effect of ""If any cunt's gonna be fighting here it will be me"": trial transcript 16.17; that the deceased called the accused a ""stand over"": trial transcript 16.18; that the accused, having been attacked by the deceased, said words to the effect of ""You're a dead cunt"" to Mr Tory Gardner: trial transcript 16.25; that shortly thereafter the accused struck a third party, a Mr Sciberras, to the elbow with a metallic weapon: trial transcript 16.47; that the accused, at a later stage, said to his brother that he wished to travel to the home of Mr Douglas in order to obtain ""three bottles of methadone and a script of Xanax"": trial transcript 20.47; and that the accused said, in the presence of his brother, ""We're going to kill that cunt if he don't give me my methadone"": trial transcript 21.6.

8In defence counsel's opening, it was said to be ""also accepted that there was an interaction"" between the accused and the deceased after the deceased struck the accused, and ""that words were exchanged, but words were exchanged of a similar nature to what was being said to him"": trial transcript 32.22- 32.25. It was also said that, ""It will be a matter for you to unravel it, but it's there, a violent attack, and response in words in terms of 'I'll get you back', after an exchange between the two men"": trial transcript 32.39 - 32.39.

9At trial transcript 32.48-33.1, defence counsel told the jury ""it's accepted that the accused armed himself after the attack with a socket wrench, and he kept that in his possession. That is not in dispute. He accepts that. The position of the defence was that was to defend himself, but in any event, he has it"".

10The evidence tendered on the voir dire shows that one can expect that there will be evidence in the trial that the accused is in the habit of using very harsh language, including with regard to the deceased, on occasions when the accused was aware that the deceased had died a violent death at the hands of some person.

11As a result of the matters foreshadowed in the openings and on the voir dire, and with the agreement of both parties, I provided the jury on Tuesday 9 July 2014 with a firm warning against being emotional or prejudiced against any party or person ""and especially the accused"". There is no need for me to extract that warning in this judgment; it appears in its entirety at page 58 of the trial transcript.

12Earlier today, before defence counsel made the application under consideration, I indicated to the parties that I would be very open to giving a direction to the jury in conformity with the document headed ""Direction to Disregard Inadmissible Opinions"", a copy of which is retained on the Court file and bears today's date.

13During discussion of the application, I queried of counsel whether there had been notice in the brief that Mr Tory Gardner could well say something along the lines of the material that founds the application. I was informed that, in the brief, there was no material to suggest that Mr Tory Gardner would ""blurt out"" the material about the reputation of the accused that founds the application.

14The other aspect of context is that it is certainly the case that I interrupted Mr Tory Gardner, and did so with a degree of sharpness, as a result of my desire to do my best to ensure that inadmissible material was not repeated before the jury. However, it is not as if that was the only occasion upon which I have interrupted a witness for that purpose. Other occasions upon which I have interrupted other civilian witnesses, with a degree of sharpness in the presence of the jury, can be found in the trial transcript at 94.42, 97.32, and 97.47. Indeed, after the exchange that is the basis of the discharge application, I interrupted Mr Gardner himself with regard to another matter at 119.9. In other words, the circumstances of me interrupting a witness who was giving offending material or potentially offending material were by no means exceptional.

15Turning to review the submissions that have been helpfully made this morning, defence counsel submitted that the evidence is highly prejudicial and cannot be cured by any direction, general or specific. 

16He submitted that the topic of what the accused allegedly said to Mr Tory Gardner must be returned to with some specificity in cross-examination, as must what Mr Tory Gardner allegedly said to the deceased about it.

17He also submitted that the jury will need to know, in order to understand the context of the listening devices and telephone intercepts, that the accused was in custody for some months, not having been charged and bail refused with regard to murder. 

18He submitted that the jury might infer, from charging decisions made by police, that the accused had been ""targeted"" by them, and speculate on the character of the accused as a result. 

19He submitted that it could well be that, if the jury seeks a transcript for their assistance in the jury room, I am not empowered to provide the jury with a transcript discreetly edited in their absence to remove the offending ten words or so.

20He submitted that the other prejudicial material in the trial creates a question of greater prejudice, not less prejudice.

21He submitted that the trial proper has only proceeded for two days or so.

22Finally, he submitted that the evidence of reputation of the accused given by Mr Tory Gardner directly and highly prejudicially links with the Crown case, namely the attendance of the accused at the home of the deceased with his brothers armed with weapons. 

23The Crown Prosecutor submitted simply that the evidence could be cured by a simple direction that the evidence of reputation on the part of Mr Gardner with regard to the accused demonstrates nothing, is irrelevant, and is to be disregarded. She referred to the decision of the R v Helmhout [2000] NSWSC 218, at first instance, as an example of the more modern robust approach. She noted that that decision, in turn, refers to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Glennon v R [1994] HCA 7; 179 CLR 1, and the fact that the criminal justice system proceeds upon the assumption that jurors generally obey the directions of trial judges.

24Turning to the applicable legal principles, in R v Ahola (No 6) [2013] NSWSC 703 at [11] to [18], I reviewed the leading decisions of the High Court of Australia and the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal with regard to the test to be applied by a trial judge on an application for the discharge of the jury as a result of prejudicial material having been inadvertently been placed before it. Due to the exigencies of the situation, I shall not repeat that analysis. I have reviewed that judgment again today and have provided a copy of it to counsel for their consideration. Neither of them has submitted that any aspect of my review of legal principle in that judgment is incorrect. Suffice it to say that the test is whether it has been established by the applicant that there is a high degree of necessity for the jury to be discharged.

25Since the time when I delivered that earlier judgment, two further judgments of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal have come to my attention with regard to circumstances in which a jury should be discharged. They are R v Clark [2010] NSWCCA 94 and Trieu v R [2012] NSWCCA 169. The first of those judgments is to do with an application at trial to discharge a juror who had come to know something of previous proceedings with regard to the appellant. The latter is to do with an application to discharge the jury when a person was seemingly loitering around the jury's entrance to the courthouse. In that sense, neither of those decisions is directly on point. Nevertheless, each of them confirms the test that I have enunciated above.

26Turning to my determination, it cannot be denied that it is regrettable that the witness said what he said. 

27I also accept that my desire to avoid repetition of the inadmissible material may perhaps have led me inadvertently to draw attention to it. 

28It is also true that the trial is at a very early stage, namely at its third day.

29In the circumstances, and in light of the gravity of the count that the accused is facing, and in accordance with the submissions of both parties, I give no weight in the exercise of my discretion to the countervailing fact that the trial has been delayed for over a week due to the failure of an important Crown witness to attend in answer to his subpoena. Nor do I give any weight in the exercise of my discretion to any other logistical considerations that attach to the trial. 

30Nevertheless, I am not satisfied that there is a high degree of necessity for the jury to be discharged. That is so for a number of reasons.

31First, as I have sought to show in this judgment, it is not as if the offending remark of the witness is the only material that will be before the jury that reflects adversely on the character of the accused; indeed, quite the contrary. In that sense, I consider that the offending material needs to be seen in the context of the whole of the evidence in the trial, both given and foreshadowed. Some of the material that reflects adversely on the character of the accused has been indicated to be undisputed. In that context, I do not regard the evidence as being of the greatest moment, even despite its connection to the Crown allegation. To my mind, there will be a plethora of evidence before the jury, quite separate from the allegation of murder, that suggests that the accused is a person associated with violence, threats thereof, and prohibited drugs, including methadone, itself associated with heroin addiction, itself associated with crimes of violence. 

32Whilst it is true that this fact cuts both ways, I do not analyse the further evidence that founds the application as having the effect of tipping the trial over to the point where it cannot proceed further before this jury.

33Secondly, I have already given the jury a firm warning against prejudice and specifically directed them not to be prejudiced in any way against the accused. I fully intend to repeat and strengthen that warning in my summing-up.

34Thirdly, I have I expressed this morning my readiness to give a further direction calling upon the jury to disregard completely extraneous expressions of opinions by any witness without highlighting, in a potentially counterproductive way, the material upon which this application is based. Furthermore, if it is sought, I would be quite open to giving the jury a highly specific direction to disregard completely the ten words that found this application.

35Fourthly, I am not aware of the jury reacting in an obviously emotional or adverse way when the evidence was given.

36Fifthly, the evidence is not directly of other disreputable acts of the accused, but only of what the witness believed the reputation of the accused to be at that stage. It is noteworthy that the evidence was preceded (at trial transcript 113.25 - 113.26) by the proposition that the witness, when threatened by the accused with ""guns"" a short time before, was not ""really worried by that stage"".

37Sixthly, I consider that Mr Tory Gardner can be cross-examined about the topics identified by defence counsel without needing to stray into and repeat the offending portions. If defence counsel wishes me to, I will strictly enforce the rule that a witness subject to cross-examination must answer a direct question directly: see Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [119].

38Seventhly, unassisted by authority at this stage, I am nevertheless confident that I have a discretion to delete from any transcript provided to the jury (though not from the trial transcript itself of course) inadmissible material, and to do so discreetly.

39Eighthly, if defence counsel wishes me to do so, I am quite open to giving the jury a firm direction that decisions by the police about who was to be charged with what offence when are completely irrelevant to their task.

40Ninthly, I accept that there will be a degree of prejudice accruing to the accused if it be the case that the jury must know that he was bail refused for a time although not charged with murder. Again, if defence counsel wishes, I will give the jury a firm direction above and beyond what I have said in my earlier direction about prejudice, which already explicitly mentioned the topic of people being in custody.

41In short, I accept that the giving of the evidence twice constitutes a blemish on the trial. It certainly would have been preferable if it had not occurred. However, I do not consider, in the particular circumstances and context of this trial, that the test promulgated by the High Court of Australia of a high degree of necessity has been made out. The result is that the application is refused.

2764289,R v Hunter (No 7) [2014] NSWSC 1150,"Judgment
1Objection has been taken by defence counsel to the contents of two conversations between the accused and police officers in which it is alleged that he made admissions.  The objection is based on s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and is chiefly founded on the submission that, on each occasion, the police did not comply with the requirements of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 NSW (""LEPRA"") and the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Regulation 2005 (""the Regulations"").
Subject matter of objections
2The first conversation allegedly occurred on 21 June 2011, and the second conversation on 20 October 2011.  
3The first conversation is contained in [16] of the statement of Senior Constable Hind-Spiteri of 12 January 2012, which became voir dire exhibit 2, and [22] of the statement of Detective Sergeant Evans completed 22 February 2012, which became voir dire exhibit 3.  These passages are relevantly identical, and it is convenient to extract the relevant passages from the former statement.  The portions of the first conversation that are objected to are emphasised: 
Detective Sergeant EVANS said, ""Paul my name is Detective Sergeant EVANS and this is Detective Senior Constable HIND-SPITERI. We are Detectives here at Mt Druitt.""
Paul HUNTER said, ""Yeah.""
Detective Sergeant EVANS said, ""Paul Detective Senior Constable HIND-SPITERI and I are investigating some matters and I want you to understand that you are not obliged to say or do anything and anything you say or do will be recorded and may later be used in evidence at court. Do you understand that?""
Paul HUNTER said, ""Yeah.""
Detective Sergeant EVANS said, ""Paul I want you to understand that you are under arrest for and [sic] affray which occurred at 9 Livingston Avenue Dharruk. You are not obliged to say or do anything and anything you say or do will be recorded and may later be used in evidence at court. Do you understand that?""
Paul HUNTER said, ""I was the one who got hit, he hit me."" 
Detective Sergeant EVANS said, ""Do you understand what I said?""
Paul HUNTER said, ""Yeah but he hit me.""   
...
Detective Sergeant EVANS said, ""Paul I also want you to understand you are under arrest for the assault, serious assault upon Jason DIXON on 20th June 2011. You are not obliged to say or do anything and anything you say or do will be recorded and may later be used in evidence at court, Do you understand that?""
Paul HUNTER said, ""Yeah, I was at Mt Druitt Hospital, you do the maths.""
4The second conversation is contained in [46] of the statement of Senior Constable Hind-Spiteri of 12 January 2012, which became voir dire exhibit 2, and [6] of the statement of Sergeant Lowe of 12 January 2012, which became voir dire exhibit 6.  Again, these passages are relevantly identical, and it is convenient to extract the relevant passages from the former statement.  The portions of the second conversation that are the subject of objection are emphasised:
About 11am on Thursday the 20 October 2011 Detective Sergeant LOWE and I attended the Metropolitan and Remand Reception Centre at Silverwater. When there I saw Paul HUNTER taken into police custody in the police charge room situated there. After HUNTER spoke to the custody manager I heard Detective Sergeant LOWE say, ""Paul HUNTER, I am Detective Sergeant LOWE from the Homicide Squad and this is Detective HIND-SPITERI you are under arrest for the murder of Jason DIXON. You are not obliged to say or do anything but anything you say or do will be recorded and may later be used in evidence. Do you understand that?""
HUNTER said, ""I'm not saying anything I wasn't even there I was at the hospital.""
Detective Sergeant LOWE said, ""We have information that suggests otherwise. What we propose to do is ask you a number of questions that will be recorded on the DVD system.""
HUNTER said, ""No.""
Detective Sergeant LOWE said, ""Will you sign my notebook refusing to be interviewed.""
HUNTER said, ""No I am not saying or signing nothing.""
Outline of the position of the parties
5To state the foundation of the objections simply, it is said that, on the first occasion, the police failed to comply with the requirement, pursuant to s 122 of LEPRA, that the accused be cautioned and provided with a summary of Part 9 of that Act.  It is also said that the police failed to comply with the requirements of the Regulations, in particular cll 27 and 33.  
6As for the second occasion, defence counsel submits that the identical failings occurred.  He also submits that, in truth, the accused was arrested for the improper purpose of being questioned, rather than being charged and brought before a court.
7The position of the Crown Prosecutor can be simply stated.  She submits with regard to each occasion that informing the accused that he was under arrest, and of the offence for which he had been arrested, and of the fact that he had a right to silence, cannot be characterised as an ""investigative procedure in which a detained person is to participate"".  Accordingly, there was no failing on the part of the police with regard to s 123 of LEPRA.  As for s 122, she submitted that provision had indeed been complied with on each occasion.
8A number of documents were tendered by defence counsel on the voir dire.  Two police officers, Detective Sergeant Evans and Detective Sergeant Lowe, were also cross-examined with regard to the events in question.
Findings of fact on the voir dire
9With regard to the first occasion, I make the following findings of fact, founded upon the documentary exhibits on the voir dire and the evidence of Detective Sergeant Evans in the witness box.  
10On the evening of 20 June 2011, the police became aware that the deceased had been the victim of a serious assault.  Thereafter a large number of police engaged in a variety of investigations.  
11Sometime after 4:20 PM on 21 June 2011, the accused was arrested by Senior Constable Burton and Detective Mackie pursuant to a warrant.  He was warned that he did not have to say anything, but anything he did say could be used against him.  
12At about 4:53 PM that day the accused arrived at Mt Druitt Police Station and was brought in to the charge room.  
13At 5:18 PM Senior Constable Clarke, who was then serving as the custody manager, contacted the Aboriginal Legal Service and spoke to a solicitor there, and informed her that the accused was being detained at the police station.  
14At 5:30 PM a new custody manager, Senior Constable Horwood, began her shift.  
15At about 6 PM Detective Sergeant Evans and Detective Senior Constable Hind-Spiteri spoke to the accused at Mt Druitt Police Station.  Thereafter the conversation the subject of objection allegedly took place.  
16At 6:07 PM Senior Constable Horwood provided the accused with a caution and summary of Part 9 of LEPRA.
17With regard to the second occasion, I make the following findings of fact, on the basis of the documentary evidence and the oral evidence of Detective Sergeant Lowe.
18On 20 October 2011, the accused was conveyed from the MRRC to a police station located adjacent to that gaol.  That occurred by way of an order made pursuant to s 25 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW).  He arrived at 12 midday.  At the same time, the custody manager provided the accused with a caution and summary of Part 9 of LEPRA.  Shortly after that, the conversation that is the subject of objection allegedly occurred.  There was no dispute on the voir dire that the following conversation occurred immediately afterwards: 
Detective Sergeant LOWE said, ""It is just a matter of time before your [sic] charged with murder.""
HUNTER said, ""He hit me and your [sic] going to charge me?""
Detective Sergeant LOWE said, ""No one from your family even wants to tell us about the assault on you.""
HUNTER said, ""Yeah because I've trained them well.  They won't say nothing unless I give them the Okay.""
Detective Sergeant LOWE said, ""I tried Deanna, Paul junior both said no.  It makes it hard when you act like you have something to hide.
HUNTER said, ""We don't speak to cops.""
(The first exchange has been separately excluded by me pursuant to s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW); the latter two exchanges are not pressed by the Crown in the trial.)
19Thereafter, at 12:05 PM, the custody manager made a call to the Aboriginal Legal Service and left a message on the answering machine.
Statutory framework
20It is convenient at this stage to set out some of the provisions upon which the application for exclusion is founded.
21Part 9 of LEPRA is entitled ""Investigations and Questioning"".  Neither that Part nor s 3 of LEPRA provides a definition of ""investigative procedure"".  Pursuant to s 111, the Part applies to persons who are arrested by police for an offence.  Section 112(1)(b) permits the regulations to modify the application of the Part to Aboriginal persons.  (There was no dispute before me that the accused is such a person.)  Section 114 permits a person to be detained after arrest for the purposes of investigation for a limited period.  Subsequent sections set out the mechanism of that detention.
22Section 122 is as follows: 
122   Custody manager to caution, and give summary of Part to, detained person
(1)  As soon as practicable after a person who is detained under this Part (a detained person) comes into custody at a police station or other place of detention, the custody manager for the person must orally and in writing:
(a)  caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence, and
(b)  give the person a summary of the provisions of this Part that is to include reference to the fact that the maximum investigation period may be extended beyond 4 hours by application made to an authorised officer and that the person, or the person's legal representative, may make representations to the authorised officer about the application.
(2)  The giving of a caution does not affect a requirement of any law that a person answer questions put by, or do things required by, a police officer.
(3)  After being given the information referred to in subsection (1) orally and in writing, the person is to be requested to sign an acknowledgment that the information has been so given. [Emphasis added at s 122(1)]
23Section 123 relevantly is as follows: 
123   Right to communicate with friend, relative, guardian or independent person and Australian legal practitioner
(1)  Before any investigative procedure in which a detained person is to participate starts, the custody manager for the person must inform the person orally and in writing that he or she may:
(a)  communicate, or attempt to communicate, with a friend, relative, guardian or independent person:
(i)  to inform that person of the detained person's whereabouts, and
(ii)  if the detained person wishes to do so, to ask the person communicated with to attend at the place where the person is being detained to enable the detained person to consult with the person communicated with, and
(b)  communicate, or attempt to communicate, with an Australian legal practitioner of the person's choice and ask that Australian legal practitioner to do either or both of the following:
(i)  attend at the place where the person is being detained to enable the person to consult with the Australian legal practitioner,
(ii)  be present during any such investigative procedure.
...

(10)  After being informed orally and in writing of his or her rights under this section, the person is to be requested to sign an acknowledgment that he or she has been so informed. [Emphasis added]
24Regulations have been made pursuant to s 112.  They are contained in Part 3 Division 3 of the Regulations.
25Clause 24 of the Regulations makes it clear that an Aboriginal person is a vulnerable person for the purposes of the Regulations.  
26Clause 27 of the Regulations relevantly is as follows:
27   Support person may be present during investigative procedure
(1)  A detained person who is a vulnerable person is entitled to have a support person present during any investigative procedure in which the detained person is to participate.
(2)  However, a detained person who is a vulnerable person solely as a result of being a person of non-English speaking background is entitled to have a support person present only if an interpreter is not required to be arranged under section 128 (1) of the Act solely because of section 128 (3) (a) of the Act.
(3)  Before any such investigative procedure starts, the custody manager for the detained person must inform the person that the person is entitled to the presence of a support person during the investigative procedure.
(4)  If the detained person wishes to have a support person present, the custody manager must, as soon as practicable:
(a)  give the detained person reasonable facilities to enable the person to arrange for a support person to be present, and
(b)  allow the detained person to do so in circumstances in which, so far as practicable, the communication will not be overheard.
(5)  The custody manager must defer for a reasonable period any such investigative procedure until a support person is present unless the detained person has expressly waived his or her right to have a support person present.
(6)  An investigative procedure is not required to be deferred under subclause (5) for more than 2 hours to allow a support person to arrive at the place of detention.
...
27Clause 33 of the Regulations is as follows: 
33   Legal assistance for Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders
(1)  If a detained person is an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander, then, unless the custody manager for the person is aware that the person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present during questioning of the person, the custody manager must:
(a)  immediately inform the person that a representative of the Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT) Limited will be notified:
(i)  that the person is being detained in respect of an offence, and
(ii)  of the place at which the person is being detained, and
(b)  notify such a representative accordingly.
(2)  (Repealed) [Emphasis added]
28Finally, on the dates in question in 2011, s 99 of LEPRA was as follows:
99   Power of police officers to arrest without warrant
(1)  A police officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person if:
...

(c)  the person has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been tried.
(2)  A police officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person if the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has committed an offence under any Act or statutory instrument.
(3)  A police officer must not arrest a person for the purpose of taking proceedings for an offence against the person unless the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to arrest the person to achieve one or more of the following purposes:
(a)  to ensure the appearance of the person before a court in respect of the offence,
(b)  to prevent a repetition or continuation of the offence or the commission of another offence,
(c)  to prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of evidence relating to the offence,
(d)  to prevent harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence in proceedings in respect of the offence,
(e)  to prevent the fabrication of evidence in respect of the offence,
(f)  to preserve the safety or welfare of the person.
(4)  A police officer who arrests a person under this section must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any property found on the person, before an authorised officer to be dealt with according to law. [Emphasis added]
Submissions
29Turning to the submissions of the parties, defence counsel submitted that LEPRA and the Regulations had been breached on 21 June 2011.  He submitted that the requirements of LEPRA and the Regulations should have been complied with before the conversation between the accused and Detective Sergeant Evans.  He submitted in short that ""the stating of the allegation and a caution by an investigator is an investigative step.""  
30As for the second occasion on 20 October 2011, he made the same submission.  In other words, he submitted that the Aboriginal Legal Service should have been contacted well before the detectives travelled to the police station adjacent to the gaol.  He also submitted that I would find that Detective Sergeant Lowe well knew that the accused would have been represented by either the Aboriginal Legal Service or Legal Aid with regard to other charges that he was facing as at 20 October 2011, and with regard to which he was bail refused.  He submitted that a deliberate strategy had been adopted of not contacting the lawyers for the accused and seeking to obtain admissions from him without the presence of a lawyer or a support person.  He submitted that the conversation that occurred after the accused indicated that he wished to say nothing supported that conclusion.
31Finally, he submitted that the applicant was in custody bail refused.  Therefore, even though he had been transferred from the gaol pursuant to a s 25 order, he was subject to a commitment warrant.  Accordingly, to the extent that he was arrested, that could only have been for questioning, a course that is impermissible at common law and pursuant to LEPRA.
32Defence counsel referred me to a single decision of a District Court judge in which an ERISP in which an Aboriginal person had engaged was ruled inadmissible: R v Powell [2010] NSWDC 84.
33As I have indicated, the Crown Prosecutor respectfully submitted that the application is misconceived.  She submitted that it is quite correct that various responsibilities devolved upon the police pursuant to LEPRA and the Regulations.  But she submitted that the police complied with them.
34She submitted that on 21 June 2011 the accused was given a caution and Part 9 summary ""as soon as practical after"" he became a person who was detained under Part 9, in accordance with s 122 of LEPRA.  That is because the accused was arrested by Detective Sergeant Evans on various charges at about 6 PM, thereby engaging Part 9 of LEPRA.  Prior to that time, he had been arrested and detained pursuant to a warrant.  And she submitted that the evidence established that the caution and Part 9 summary were provided at 6:07 PM.  In short, she submitted that a period of seven minutes or so must be ""as soon as practical"" after ""about 6 pm"".
35As for the interaction between the detectives and the accused on that evening, she submitted that one cannot characterise simply informing a person that he or she is under arrest, setting out the underlying offence, and informing a person that he she possesses a right to silence as an ""investigative procedure"".  Accordingly, s 123(1) and the sections of LEPRA and clauses of the Regulations dependent upon it were not engaged.
36She made very similar submissions about the events of 20 October 2011.  Indeed, on that occasion she submitted that the caution and Part 9 summary were given immediately upon the attendance of the accused at the police premises; namely, at 12 midday.  After the interaction between the detectives and the accused, during which the accused indicated his refusal to be interviewed, she submitted that the Aboriginal Legal Service was contacted, perhaps unnecessarily.  Again she submitted that there was no investigative procedure in which the accused participated on that occasion.
37Finally, she submitted that there was nothing inappropriate in the police arresting the accused on 20 October 2011.
Determination
38Having taken time to reflect, I respectfully accept the submissions of the learned Crown Prosecutor.  I do not consider that informing a citizen that he or she has been arrested with regard to a particular offence, and informing him or her that he or she possesses a right to silence, constitutes an ""investigative procedure"".  It follows that the responsibilities of the custody manager contained in s 123 of LEPRA and cl 27 of the Regulations had not arisen at the time of either of the exchanges that are the subject of objection.  
39Nor do I consider that such a process is ""questioning"" for the purposes of cl 33 of the Regulations.  It follows that the requirements of cl 33 of the Regulations did not arise at the early stage under discussion.  Of course, the situation would have been different if the detectives on either occasion had proceeded to question the accused.  But here the evidence subject to objection arose from the police complying with the law and informing the accused of his rights; it did not arise from an ""investigative procedure"" or ""questioning"".
40I respectfully accept the submission of defence counsel that, in engaging in the conversation that immediately followed the exchanges subject to objection on 20 October 2011, Detective Sergeant Lowe was exploring whether he could obtain information from the accused.  I do not accept that it was merely a ""chat"", in the words of the Detective in the witness box.  Nevertheless, that finding does not lead me to conclude that, in not telephoning the Aboriginal Legal Service before he attended at the police premises on 20 October 2011, the police officer was engaging in some sort of stratagem.  In other words, I do not consider that it was improper of Detective Sergeant Lowe not to arrange legal representation prior to his attendance on 20 October 2011.
41Furthermore, I consider that the police were entitled to arrest the accused on 20 October 2011, pursuant to s 99(2) of LEPRA as it then was.  In any event, I accept the submission of defence counsel that the liberty of the accused was being curtailed by the fact that he was bail refused on separate charges, and whether he was arrested or not made no difference to his liberty.  
42Finally, whilst the experience in criminal law of the judge who excluded the evidence in R v Powell cannot be doubted, the facts of that case are markedly different to here, not least because the accused in that case engaged in an ERISP.  
43In short, I consider that on each occasion the police complied with LEPRA and the Regulations.
Ancillary findings
44As against the possibility that I am wrong in my analysis of LEPRA and the Regulations, and there was indeed an illegality or impropriety on either occasion, I turn briefly and contingently to consider the factors contained in s 138(3) of the Evidence Act.
45On 21 June 2011, it is alleged that the accused said ""I was the one who got hit, he hit me"" and ""yeah but he hit me.""  It is also alleged that, with regard to the assault on the deceased on 20 June 2011, the accused said ""Yeah, I was at Mt Druitt Hospital, you do the maths.""
46As I understand the Crown case, the proposition that the deceased assaulted the accused first is relied upon as a motive for retaliation by way of the fatal assault.  The proposition that the accused was at Mt Druitt Hospital is alleged to be a lie on his part, setting up a false alibi.  That proposition is in turn based on the fact that, by way of an affidavit tendered on the voir dire, his solicitor has deposed that her instructions are that the accused was indeed at the scene of the assault, but ""the blows"" were delivered by someone else.
47I assess the probative value of the evidence of motive and of a lie potentially demonstrating consciousness of guilt as very high: s 138(3)(a).  
48I also regard the evidence as important in the proceedings: s 138(3)(b).  Whether it may be the case that the Crown can demonstrate that the accused has said similar things on other occasions does not derogate to any substantial degree from the importance of the evidence. 
49The offence alleged against the accused is exceptionally serious: s 138(3)(c).  
50If, contrary to my analysis, there was a contravention or impropriety, I do not regard it as significant but rather as technical: s 138(3)(d).  
51I do not consider that, if there was an impropriety or contravention, Detective Sergeant Evans caused it to occur deliberately or recklessly: s 138(3)(e).  Rather, I consider that it was done accidentally.
52As for the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it can be seen that Article 9 cl 2 was complied with, and in a sense that compliance is the subject of the objection.  On my analysis, no other provision of that Covenant was breached: s 138(3)(f).
53If there was an impropriety or illegality, I consider it very unlikely that there will be any proceedings with regard to it: s 138(3)(g).  
54Finally, it would have been difficult to obtain the evidence in question any other way: s 138(3)(h).  By that I mean the evidence of motive and a lie was allegedly given by the accused in response to him being informed of his rights by police, and moments before he refused to engage in an ERISP.
55In short, even if I am mistaken in my statutory analysis, and there was some unwitting impropriety or contravention of the legislation or regulations in the events as they unfolded on 21 June 2011, I would be soundly satisfied that the test in s 138(1) of the Evidence Act has been made out; that is, that the desirability of admitting the evidence of that exchange outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that had been obtained in the way in which it was obtained.
56I adopt a very similar analysis with regard to the exchange of 20 October 2011.  Again, the accused allegedly said ""I wasn't even there I was at the hospital"".  On the Crown case, that is a direct contradiction of his instructions as conveyed by an affidavit sworn by his solicitor.  
57If I am wrong in my analysis, I regard that evidence as very probative and very important in the proceedings: s 138(3)(a).  
58Merely because it is a repetition in a sense of what was allegedly said on 20 June 2011 does not derogate from its importance to any large degree.  That is because it demonstrates a settled readiness of the accused allegedly to lie to the police about the events in question: s 138(3)(b).
59The accused is on trial for the most serious offence known to law: s 138(3)(c).  
60If there be an impropriety or contravention, I regard it as a technical one: s 138(3)(d).  
61In the case of Detective Sergeant Lowe, I am not satisfied that he created any impropriety or contravention deliberately or recklessly, but rather accidentally: s 138(3)(e).  
62I do not consider that any impropriety or contravention can be said to be inconsistent with the Covenant: s 138(3)(f).  
63I do not consider it likely that other proceedings will be taken with regard to any contravention or impropriety: s 138(3)(g).  
64And finally, it would have been difficult for the police to obtain the evidence in any other way, in that the evidence is of what the accused allegedly said to the police shortly before he refused to engage in an ERISP: s 138(3)(h).
65In short, with regard to the exchange of 20 October 2011, if it be the case that there was an impropriety or contravention, in considering the test contained in s 138(1) of the Evidence Act I would be firmly satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting it, in the light of any putative impropriety or contravention.
Conclusion
66It is for those reasons that I do not exclude the evidence of the exchange of 21 June 2011 or the evidence of the exchange of 20 October 2011.

		21 August 2014",2014-07-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764291,DAO v R (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 126,"JUDGMENT


	
	SIMPSON J: On 21 March 2012 the appellant was arraigned in the District Court in Sydney on an indictment that contained 23 counts (two of which were pleaded as alternatives to other counts on the indictment). He entered a plea of not guilty to all counts and a jury was empanelled. After a six-week trial, on 2 May 2012, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on each of the 21 primary counts. It was therefore unnecessary to return verdicts on the two alternative counts.
	
	
	The appellant was subsequently sentenced by Zahra DCJ to an overall term of imprisonment of 13 years, commencing on 2 May 2012, with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months which will expire on 1 November 2020.
	
	
	The appellant appeals against the convictions. He has not sought leave to appeal against the sentences, either individually or in total.
	
	
	All counts on the indictment are of sexual offences against young males, allegedly committed by the appellant when he was a Catholic priest in the Hunter Valley area, and the complainants were parishioners. Four complainants were the subject of the indictment. Counts 1 to 8 (of which counts 4 and 6 were alternatives to counts 3 and 5) alleged offences against a complainant to whom I will refer as “DP”, committed between 1 January 1982 and 31 December 1984. Counts 9 to 13 alleged offences against a complainant to whom I will refer as “SM”, committed between 31 January 1987 and 28 December 1988. Counts 14 to 21 alleged offences against a complainant to whom I will refer as “MB”, committed between 18 April 1990 and 11 March 1991. Counts 22 and 23 alleged offences against a complainant to whom I will refer as “JC”, committed between 27 July 1991 and 31 January 1993.
	


Procedural history


	
	The matter has a considerable procedural history. The appellant initially faced trial in 2010. He was then charged with sexual offences against six young males, including SM, MB and JC. The counts alleging offences against DP were not then the subject of the indictment. The Director of Public Prosecutions (“the Director”) proposed a single trial of the allegations involving all six complainants. By Notice of Motion filed shortly before the trial was due to commence, the appellant sought orders for the separate trial of the counts involving each of the complainants. In response, the Director gave notice under s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) of his intention to adduce tendency evidence. He proposed that the evidence concerning each complainant be admitted, as tendency evidence, in respect of the allegations concerning each other complainant. It was accepted that, if the evidence were to be so admitted, then an order for separate trials would be pointless, and the appellant’s application should fail.
	
	
	The Notice of Motion came on for hearing before Bozic DCJ, who was to be the trial judge. After hearing argument, his Honour took a middle course. He ruled that the evidence relating to the allegations concerning SM, MB and JC was admissible in each case as tendency evidence. He accordingly ordered a joint trial of those allegations. However, he ordered that the trials of the allegations concerning the three remaining complainants be severed: DAO v R (NSWDC, 4 November 2010, unreported).
	
	
	Pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court against the order that the trials of the allegations concerning SM, MB and JC proceed in a joint trial. He continued to seek separate trials of the allegations concerning each individual complainant. The basis of the application was that the evidence the Director proposed to adduce as tendency evidence was not admissible as such and that therefore overwhelming prejudice would result from a joint trial, and, accordingly, separate trials should be ordered.
	
	
	A five judge bench of this Court granted leave to appeal, but upheld the decision of Bozic DCJ and dismissed the appeal: DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568, per Spigelman CJ, Allsop P and Simpson, Kirby and Schmidt JJ. The appellant sought special leave to appeal to the High Court. On 28 October 2011 special leave was refused: DAO v The Queen [2011] HCA Trans 298.
	
	
	The trial of the allegations concerning SM, MB and JC was fixed to commence in the District Court on 21 March 2012 before Zahra DCJ. At some time prior to that date, the Director notified the appellant that he intended to include on the indictment the counts relating to DP. Those counts were not the subject of the indictment presented to Bozic DCJ, nor of the appeal to this Court. On the presentment of an indictment to Zahra DCJ that included those counts, the appellant, by Notice of Motion, sought that they be severed. In making that application, senior counsel who appeared for the appellant (both at trial and on appeal) expressly acknowledged that, having regard to the decision of this Court in DAO, the application would fail. On 22 March 2012 Zahra DCJ dismissed the Notice of Motion. His Honour concluded that the reasoning of Bozic DCJ in the earlier ruling, upheld by this Court, equally applied to the counts concerning DP. He therefore ruled that the evidence concerning the DP allegations was admissible as tendency evidence with respect to the counts concerning each other complainant, and vice versa. There is, in the present appeal, no ground that expressly challenges that ruling.
	
	
	The trial proceeded and finished with the conviction of the appellant on all 21 primary counts.
	
	
	At this stage, it is convenient to note a subsequent development. Following the jury verdict in the trial the subject of this appeal, the appellant was tried in relation to the allegations involving the three complainants the trial of which Bozic DCJ had separated. He was acquitted on all counts. I mention this because, for the purpose of this appeal, the appellant seeks to adduce evidence derived from that trial.
	
	
	With that background I now turn to the issues raised on the appeal.
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	As originally filed, the grounds of appeal were as follows:
	


“1.  His Honour erred in failing to order separate trials for each of the four complainants.

2.  His Honour erred in admitting the evidence of tendency with respect to each of the respective complainants pursuant to ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995.

3.  The verdict[s] with respect to the DP matters were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.

4.  The verdicts with respect to the SM matters were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.

5.  The verdicts with respect to the MB matters were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.

6.  The verdicts with respect to the JC matters were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.

7.  At the hearing of the appeal the appellant will seek to rely on fresh evidence.”


	
	At the commencement of the hearing the appellant sought and was granted leave to amend the Notice of Appeal by adding two additional grounds, as follows:
	


“GROUND TWO A:  and/or; The appellant has suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of the evidence regarding each of the four complainants being admitted with respect to each other in the course of the trial.

GROUND SEVEN A:  and/or; The appellant has suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of the absence of the fresh evidence from his trial.”

The prosecution case: an overview


	
	What follows is a brief overview of the prosecution case. It will be necessary, when I come to a consideration of grounds 3 to 6, to expand considerably the reference to the evidence alleged and the factual issues. Although some background facts are uncontroversial, the factual accounts that follow are accounts of what was alleged in the Crown case. They are not intended to represent any findings of fact, or acceptance of the Crown allegations. All of the allegations of conduct constituting the offences charged were disputed.
	
	
	At the time of the commission of the offences, the appellant was either a trainee priest or an ordained priest in the Catholic Church in the Hunter Valley area. Each complainant was a male child of a Catholic family living in the parish to which the appellant was, at the relevant time, assigned. (It may here be noted that the evidence established that, in 1982, the beginning of the range of dates alleged in counts 1-8, the appellant was a university student, living in accommodation provided by the Catholic Church but not a trainee priest.)
	


The allegations concerning DP


	
	The indictment alleged offences against DP committed between 1 January 1982 and 31 December 1984. In 1982 the appellant was in his final year of an Arts degree at the University of Newcastle, and living in a hostel in or near Maitland. Between 1983 and 1985 he was studying for the priesthood at St Patrick’s College, Manly. He was posted to the Maitland parish in December 1985.
	
	
	DP was born in May 1973. In 1982 he and his family lived in Maitland and he attended a local Catholic school, St John’s Primary School, where he was in year 3. He knew the appellant from having seen him in the playground at his school, prior to becoming an altar boy. He was an altar boy at a local church known as the Pro-Cathedral. The priest in charge of altar boys at the Pro-Cathedral was Father Wilson. The appellant assisted in that role at the Pro-Cathedral. On an occasion when DP was helping to prepare for a Mass, the appellant began to feel DP’s body and told him to take off his clothes. The appellant fondled DP’s body by running his hands over his chest, and holding his genitals. The appellant told DP that this was in order to ascertain if DP was worthy of being an altar boy. This gave rise to count 1 on the indictment, of indecent assault.
	
	
	Thereafter, on many occasions, the appellant fondled DP’s body, held his genitals, and performed oral sex on him. He used a Polaroid camera to take photographs of DP either naked, or wearing robes. He threatened DP that if he told anybody, he would be removed from altar boy school, that life would be difficult for him, and that his family would be embarrassed. Incidents of this kind happened on many occasions. The second incident of which DP gave evidence occurred on a Sunday afternoon, as DP was, in his role as altar boy, preparing for a Mass. The appellant knelt in front of DP, rubbed his thighs and buttocks, kissed his chest and belly and cuddled him. He fondled his genitals. This allegation gave rise to count 2 on the indictment, also of indecent assault.
	
	
	One incident occurred on a camp, about which it will be necessary to say considerably more in due course. The camp was arranged to commemorate a boy who had died of leukaemia. Under the pretext of inspecting DP for ticks or leeches, the appellant held DP by the genitals, and checked around his penis and buttocks. The appellant said that this was part of altar boy school. The appellant repeatedly told DP not to tell anybody about their activities or their relationship.
	
	
	The appellant performed fellatio on DP. This gave rise to count 3 on the indictment, of sexual intercourse without consent (of which the appellant was convicted) and the alternative count 4, of indecent assault. There was another occasion on which the appellant performed fellatio on DP (giving rise to count 5, of sexual intercourse without consent, and the alternative count 6, of indecent assault).
	


The allegations concerning SM


	
	In January 1987 the appellant was appointed as assistant parish priest in Muswellbrook.
	
	
	SM was born in December 1973. He lived in Muswellbrook. At the time the appellant was appointed to Muswellbrook SM was 13 years of age and in year 8 at local Catholic high school (St Joseph’s). He, too, was an altar boy. He attended the St James’ Catholic Church in Muswellbrook. The appellant, with another priest (Father Nugent), lived in the presbytery adjoining the church.
	
	
	The appellant conducted a youth group of which SM was a member. One of the activities was wrestling. SM was having a difficult time at home and at school; the appellant invited him to come to the presbytery “to have a chat”. SM did so. After a brief talk, the appellant initiated wrestling. The wrestling became sexual. The appellant inserted his penis between SM’s buttocks. This gave rise to count 9 on the indictment, of indecent assault. On another occasion, again after wrestling and again at the presbytery, the appellant took hold of SM’s testicles and penis. This gave rise to count 10 on the indictment, also of indecent assault. There was a third occasion, also at the presbytery, and again in the course of wrestling, when the appellant pushed with his penis on SM’s anus, groped his buttocks sexually, and slid his penis across SM’s face. This event gave rise to counts 11, 12 and 13 on the indictment, all of indecent assault.
	


The allegations concerning MB


	
	In April 1990 the appellant was transferred to Cessnock as assistant parish priest. The parish priest was Father Vince Ryan.
	
	
	MB was born in March 1980. He lived at Cessnock and attended St Patrick’s, a local Catholic primary school until 1991, and then the local Catholic high school. From the time he was in year 3 he was an altar boy at the Catholic Church, St Joseph’s. He first met the appellant in 1990, in the playground at St Patrick’s. In 1990 his behaviour deteriorated, and he was “playing up” and “getting into a bit of trouble”. His teachers suggested that he might talk to the appellant.
	
	
	MB became friendly with the appellant. At the suggestion of the appellant, and with the permission of his parents, he began to attend the Police Citizens’ Youth Club, where he played squash with the appellant. Once or twice a week, the appellant would pick him up from his home, and drive him to the squash courts. After a time, instead of driving to the squash courts, the appellant began to take MB to a park called Kitchener Park. The appellant talked to him about his behaviour. The appellant drove a white sedan, like a Holden or Toyota. On one occasion the appellant parked at Kitchener Park and talked to him. The appellant then took MB’s hand, placed it on the appellant’s leg, and moved it under his shorts and then onto his penis, causing MB to masturbate the appellant. The appellant placed his own hand on MB’s penis. He told MB that this was what God wanted, and that it was their secret and it would make things better. This gave rise to counts 14, 15 and 16, all of indecent assault. On another occasion, after squash, the appellant took MB to the presbytery and told MB to take off his clothes. The appellant removed his own clothes. His penis was erect. He touched MB’s penis, and then had MB perform fellatio on him. This gave rise to count 17, of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years, while in a position of authority. There were other occasions, either at Kitchener Park or at the presbytery, when similar offences were committed, giving rise to counts 18 to 21, all of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years by a person in a position of authority.
	
	
	MB gave evidence that the appellant had organised a party at the presbytery for his 11th birthday which was in March 1991. A number of boys attended, and slept overnight. There was no sexual activity.
	


The allegations concerning JC


	
	In July 1991 the appellant was appointed as parish priest in Windale.
	
	
	JC was born in June 1979. He lived at Windale and attended a local Catholic primary school. He was an altar boy. At the church JC met the appellant who conducted the altar boy classes. JC mowed lawns at the presbytery for pocket money. He became friendly with the appellant. They talked together, listened to music, and wrestled. After the wrestling JC showered in the presbytery. On one occasion the appellant also was in the shower and asked JC to play a game, spitting on each other. This gave rise to count 22, of committing an act of indecency.
	
	
	On an occasion in about 1991 JC attended a camp somewhere on Lake Macquarie with the appellant and other altar boys. JC shared a tent with the appellant. One night he awoke to find the appellant on top of him, his penis erect. He was moving around JC’s buttocks. This gave rise to count 23, of aggravated indecent assault by a person in authority. JC said that, the following morning, he told another of the campers, a boy called Chris, whose father was also present. He remembered that they were there with a ski boat. They did not take him seriously, and told him he must have been dreaming, and to forget about it.
	


The defence case


	
	The appellant gave evidence. He denied all allegations. He called a number of witnesses who gave evidence relevant to various matters of detail in the Crown case. I will deal with these below. They are material to grounds 3 to 6 of the appeal.
	
	
	The appellant said that, between 1980 and 1982 he was a student at Newcastle University. He lived in a facility called Edmond Gleeson House (also, or formerly, known as “Monte Pio”) in Maitland, which was a “formation house” (which I interpret to be a hostel), conducted by an Order of Catholic priests, specifically for young Catholic men contemplating entering the priesthood. He and the other residents followed a regular routine, rising early, having morning prayers, and 7.00am mass. They then drove to Newcastle for lectures. On at least two nights a week he did not return until 9.00pm.
	
	
	He attended Mass at a church called Sacred Heart Church at Campbell’s Hill, near Maitland. He had nothing to do with the Pro-Cathedral at Maitland. On one occasion only, as a member of the congregation, did he attend Mass at the Pro-Cathedral. He was dressed in civilian clothes. He never wore priestly vestments at the Pro-Cathedral.
	
	
	He spent university vacations working at a hospital. He said that he had never set foot in St John’s Primary School. He gave evidence about organising a camp in order to support the family of a young boy who suffered from leukaemia (see below).
	
	
	In 1983 he joined the St Patrick’s College at Manly in order to train for the priesthood. He lived in the seminary, and only occasionally returned to the Maitland/Newcastle district. On one occasion in 1983 he attended the Pro-Cathedral for his institution as an acolyte. He did not recall attending the Pro-Cathedral in 1984, although he may have done so if a colleague were being ordained as a priest.
	
	
	In December 1985 he was made a deacon, in a ceremony that took place at the Sacred Heart Church at Hamilton (Newcastle) and he was ordained as a priest in December 1986, in a ceremony at the Maitland Pro-Cathedral.
	
	
	The appellant said that he was appointed to Muswellbrook in 1987. He was instrumental in forming a “social youth group”. He involved the parents in supervising the group. He said that he insisted that, as a condition of the their children being permitted to participate, the parents contribute to the group activities. The group engaged in various activities, including ten-pin bowling, rock climbing and excursions, and games nights. It was common, after games nights, for the boys to begin “rumbling and wrestling” with each other and with him, and he took part. He did not recall SM being part of this.
	
	
	The appellant was chaplain of the St Joseph’s school that SM attended.
	
	
	The appellant’s first recollection of coming across SM was when SM’s grandmother asked the appellant to counsel the M family, who, she thought, were experiencing a marriage breakdown. SM’s mother told the appellant that SM was having difficulties and asked him (the appellant) to speak to SM. When the appellant approached SM, SM refused to engage with him.
	
	
	The appellant said that he had never, before or after that, had SM in the presbytery, unless it was as one of the youth group at some activity. He denied perpetrating any indecent assault on SM in the course of, or under the guise of, wrestling.
	
	
	The appellant said that, in September 1988, he took a group of young people to the Snowy Mountains where they stayed at Perisher Valley. SM was one of the group. (SM had acknowledged in cross-examination that he had attended this excursion.)
	
	
	With respect to the allegations of MB, the appellant said that, in 1989, he purchased a red Toyota Camry, which he retained until 1991. It was not until May 1991, shortly before he left Cessnock, that he purchased a white Toyota Camry. Father Vince Ryan drove a white Holden Commodore.
	
	
	He said that, before hearing the allegations made by MB, he was not aware of Kitchener Park. The first time he went there was on an inspection with his legal representatives. He said that he had never been to MB’s house. He denied ever taking MB to Kitchener Park or to the presbytery.
	
	
	He said that, in 1990, a Ms Alberta McGowan, in voluntary capacity, looked after the garden at the presbytery. She attended each weekday.
	
	
	The appellant denied organising or playing any part in the organisation of a birthday party for MB’s 11th birthday.
	
	
	In July 1991, the appellant was transferred to Windale, where he met JC and developed a friendship. JC helped by doing some gardening and lawn mowing around the presbytery, in return for small amounts of money. The appellant agreed that he and JC developed a friendship, and that at times they wrestled together. He agreed that there were times when he and JC were alone in the presbytery together. He denied that anything “untoward” occurred, and denied the spitting incident described by JC.
	
	
	The appellant said that he went on camping trips that included JC on two occasions, although he could not recall the dates. One was at Telegarry Park, near a location called Frying Pan Creek. The other was at Coachwood, which was nearby. He never took JC on a camping trip to Lake Macquarie, and had never taken him to a camp with ski boats. He did recall parish picnics from time to time at Lake Macquarie (among other places) and that there were sometimes ski boats present at these. There were no camping facilities at the Lake Macquarie sites.
	
	
	The appellant recalled the camp at Telegarry Creek because, early in the evening, a severe storm blew up that became quite frightening. JC was present with his brother. He did not share a tent with the appellant. As a result of the storm, the appellant slept on the back seat of his car. During the course of the night, JC came to the car and complained that he was wet in his tent. He slept the remainder of the night on the front seat of the appellant’s car.
	
	
	The appellant said that he remained at Windale until 1994. JC continued to mow the presbytery lawns and the two continued to wrestle. When the appellant left Windale, JC helped him in the removal of his belongings.
	
	
	Fourteen witnesses, besides the appellant, were called in the defence case. Essentially, their evidence was directed to rebutting some of the details of the evidence given in the Crown Case. It will be convenient to deal with this evidence in the consideration of grounds 3 to 6, in which the capacity of the evidence to support the allegations is challenged.
	


Ground 1: separate trials

Ground 2: tendency evidence


	
	Apart from what amounted to a formal application to sever from the indictment the counts relating to DP, no application was made to Zahra DCJ for separate trials. In the light of the decision of this Court in DAO (see [8] above) no such application could properly have been made. The only basis upon which it is now said that Zahra DCJ ought to have ordered separate trials concerned the admission of tendency evidence. Accordingly, these grounds are identical in substance. Moreover, so far as the grounds relate to the tendency evidence admitted in relation to the allegations concerning SM, MB and JC, they are all the subject of the earlier decision of this Court, constituted by five judges, in DAO. Zahra DCJ made no ruling on the admissibility of the tendency evidence in respect of SM, MB or JC. No objection was, or could have been, taken to that evidence. In admitting the evidence, Zahra DCJ was acting in accordance with the ruling of this Court, as he was obliged to do. He can hardly be held (by this Court) to have been in error in doing so. By these grounds, properly characterised, the appellant seeks to challenge the decision of this Court. As senior counsel for the appellant pointed out, the question of reconsideration by this Court of an issue litigated in an appeal where leave has been granted under s 5F(3), and the issue determined, was left open by both the Chief Justice (at [61]-[67]) and the President (at [107]). In DAO, at [207] I expressed the view that:
	


“… a real question exists as to whether, if leave is granted, and the appeal dismissed, that issue is foreclosed, in the event of conviction, from any appeal [to this Court] against that conviction [based on that ground].”


	
	In my opinion, where leave is granted to appeal under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, the ruling of this Court on the issue raised is final (subject, of course, to any further appeal to the High Court). An applicant for leave to appeal on an interlocutory basis must understand that this Court will rule once only on any evidentiary or other issue. As I sought to make clear in DAO (at [206]-[207]), s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act provides scope for a further challenge, not on the same basis as that the subject of the previous appeal, but on the basis that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. That is not the same as an appeal with respect to the admissibility of a particular item of evidence, or a particular procedural ruling (or any other question of law the subject of a s 5F(3) appeal). To establish a miscarriage of justice by reason of the admission of evidence already ruled by this Court to be admissible it would be necessary to demonstrate some departure from the evidence ruled admissible, or some unanticipated consequence of the admission of the evidence. If the evidence emerges substantially in accordance with the proposed evidence the subject of the ruling, there is no further scope for this Court to rule on its admissibility. This court does not sit on appeal from its own decisions. It may be different, of course, if some unanticipated development casts a different light on the evidence.
	
	
	The position taken on behalf of the appellant with respect to these grounds fluctuated. Lengthy written submissions were filed, challenging the admission of the tendency evidence. On the hearing of the appeal, senior counsel realistically accepted the difficulties he faced in seeking to re-litigate the admissibility of that evidence, and accepted (as he had to) that he could not identify error in the decision of Zahra DCJ to admit the evidence, nor in his Honour’s failing to order separate trials (something he had not been asked to do other than of the counts concerning DP). However, senior counsel sought to maintain an objection in relation to s 101(2) of the Evidence Act. Section 101(2) provides as follows:
	


“(2)  Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.”


	
	As I observed in DAO (at [171]-[172]), s 101(2) does not call for a separate decision. What s 101(2) does is to introduce into a s 97 decision, in criminal cases only, an additional barrier to admissibility, or an additional hurdle, for the prosecution to overcome.
	
	
	The specific issue in DAO was whether Bozic DCJ erred in declining to order separate trials of the allegations concerning SM, MB and JC. The substance of the appeal, however, was the correctness of the ruling that the evidence of each complainant was admissible as tendency evidence in relation to the allegations concerning each other complainant. In my opinion, that issue cannot be re-litigated in this Court. This Court is, effectively, functus officio in that respect. Were it not so, this Court would sit as an appeal court from itself. In my opinion this Court as presently constituted has no jurisdiction to entertain grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal, so far as those grounds relate to complainants SM, MB and JC. That does not apply to the counts concerning DP, which is not the subject of determination in this Court. However, no argument was advanced that that evidence is in any different position to the evidence of the other complainants; nor was it argued that Zahra DCJ’s ruling of 22 March 2012 that that evidence was, on the same basis, admissible, was wrong. I would therefore reject grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal.
	


Ground 2A: miscarriage of justice


	
	It was, no doubt, in anticipation of such a ruling that ground 2A was added. However, no argument was advanced that anything that occurred during the trial cast the admission of the evidence in any different light to what had been anticipated. That is, it was not suggested, for example, that the evidence emerged differently than had been anticipated, nor that, by reason of some other factor, the evidence had unexpected or unforeseen consequences. That is to say, no miscarriage of justice resulting from the admission of the evidence was identified. I would therefore reject ground 2A.
	


Grounds 3-6: unreasonable verdicts


	
	I now turn to grounds 3 to 6, which call for consideration of the allegations concerning each complainant separately. The issue in each case is whether the verdicts of guilty could not be supported by the evidence. The task of this Court where such a ground is raised is well established and well known. The court must make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. The question, ultimately, is whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, nevertheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdicts of guilty to stand: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at p 492; or whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. In making that assessment, the court is obliged to give full weight to the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt, and has had the advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses: see M v The Queen; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.
	


Ground 3: DP - unreasonable verdict (counts 1-8)


	
	All offences against DP were alleged in the indictment to have been committed between 1 January 1982 and 31 December 1984.
	
	
	In order to deal with this ground, it is necessary first to set out, in some greater detail than heretofore, the evidence given by DP and other witnesses in the Crown case. That includes detail on some apparently peripheral matters. DP’s evidence calls for close scrutiny. For the convenience of the reader, I will repeat some of what has been set out above. It was as follows.
	
	
	DP was born in May 1973. He has one sibling, an older sister. Both DP and his sister were born with a congenital abnormality. They had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot. These were corrected by surgery during their childhood. However, other children were aware of the abnormality and DP was the subject of teasing at school. (There is a significance in this apparently irrelevant fact.) The family lived in Maitland. In 1982 DP was enrolled in a local Catholic primary school, St John’s. He was in year 3. His mother was a practising Catholic, and she and the children attended the main Catholic Church in Maitland, known as the Pro-Cathedral. The Pro-Cathedral was attached to, and around the corner from, St John’s. There, in 1982, DP took his first Holy Communion. DP’s mother was keen for DP to participate in the affairs of the church, and, at her instigation, he joined “altar boy school”, with the aim of becoming an altar boy. This he did following his first Holy Communion, in 1982. “Altar boy school” was conducted at the Pro-Cathedral. DP attended training classes at the Pro-Cathedral. The classes were conducted after school, on weekends, and sometimes during school time. DP was one of the youngest of the altar boys. Others he recalled who were undertaking training (“in different stages of altar boying”) were a Mark Sarquis and his brother, a cousin of DP’s called MP, and a boy called Dilley.
	
	
	The parish priest who was in charge was Father Wilson. According to DP, the appellant used to assist Father Wilson with “the altar boying”. At that time, DP knew the appellant because, prior to joining altar boy school, he had seen the appellant in the playground and at the St John’s school. DP referred to the appellant as “Father [O]”.
	
	
	DP’s evidence was that all of the offences, with the exception of one, were committed at the Pro-Cathedral, in the context of his role as an altar boy. They involved the appellant asking DP to undress, fondling his body, including his genitals, committing acts of oral sex and attempting to bring DP to erection. He explained his actions by telling DP that he was ascertaining whether he (DP) would be a good altar boy, acceptable to God. He told DP to look at a figure of Jesus on the wall. He threatened DP with expulsion from altar boy school, with embarrassment to his family, and with hardship, if he revealed to anybody what was happening. According to DP, this conduct went on over a six month period, at which point it escalated. It took place a couple of times a week, depending upon what Masses were scheduled for the week. DP said that the appellant was present on most of the occasions of school Masses at the Pro-Cathedral. He gave specific evidence of one occasion, on a Sunday afternoon, when the appellant fondled his genitals and performed oral sex upon him. This followed a Sunday afternoon Mass.
	
	
	According to DP’s evidence, only one offence was committed other than at the Pro-Cathedral. In order to explain this evidence, it is necessary to fill in some background from sources other than DP’s evidence.
	
	
	There was in the parish a young boy called Gavin Smith, who suffered from leukaemia. He died in September 1983. Prior to his death, he expressed a wish to go camping with other boys. The appellant arranged a camp at a location called Frying Pan Creek. A number of local children who were members of the Catholic Church attended. (DP was not among them.) That camp took place (on the appellant’s evidence) immediately after Christmas in 1982 until early January 1983.
	
	
	After Gavin died in September 1983 a second camp was arranged for boys who had been friends of his, in order to help them deal with his death. (According to the appellant, that camp took place from very late December 1984 to early January 1985.) It was DP’s evidence that he was present at the second camp and that it was at this camp that the single offence that was not committed at the Pro-Cathedral was committed.
	
	
	DP’s evidence was that the camp that he attended took place some time in 1984. He said that the activities at the camp involved swimming and sports. On one occasion the appellant asked DP if he had “had the leech and tick inspection”. He told DP to take his pants down so that he could check for leeches, held his genitals, checked around his penis and between his buttocks, and said that this was part of altar boy school.
	
	
	The evidence that DP was present at the second camp was the subject of dispute in the trial.
	
	
	In cross-examination, DP confirmed his account that the offending against him commenced in 1982, after his first Holy Communion (which he thought was during the first term of that year). He confirmed that the priest in charge was Father Philip Wilson and that the appellant was also present. On DP’s understanding, the appellant was a priest, and “he was always there”. He said that in 1983 he was still engaged as an altar boy, assisting with Masses during the week at the Pro-Cathedral and that the appellant was present. He also confirmed that he attended Mass at the Pro-Cathedral on Sunday afternoons or Sunday mornings. He said, however, that the appellant was not present “towards the end” of 1984. He confirmed that all offences (other than that he alleged occurred at the camp) were committed at the Pro-Cathedral.
	
	
	He agreed that, in a statement made to police, he had described the appellant as young, very energetic, and had said that he (DP) had known him (the appellant) from school as well as from church. He said that the appellant used to come to the St John’s school and play sport with the students during lunchtime - this happened “quite a lot”.
	
	
	He said that he ceased involvement at the Pro-Cathedral after the Gavin Smith camp. He said that, as a result of the abuse he alleged, his behaviour deteriorated, and that, on a couple of occasions, he lit fires in garbage tins. He said that the appellant spoke to him on a number of occasions about his behaviour, and about his non-attendance at church.
	
	
	DP agreed that, in 2010, he was contacted by a police officer who asked him if he had any comments about the appellant. He replied by saying that he did not know what the police officer was talking about, and suggested that he had called the wrong person. He said in evidence that he did this because he did not want to talk about “it”.
	
	
	DP’s evidence was challenged on a number of bases, to which I will return.
	


The appellant’s evidence regarding DP


	
	In the following account of the appellant’s evidence, I will confine myself to so much of that evidence as relates to the allegations made by DP.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence was that, in 1980, he enrolled in an Arts Degree at Newcastle University, and continued with that course throughout 1981 and 1982. During this time he resided at the hostel called Edmund Gleeson House, which accommodated young men contemplating entry into the priesthood. Edmund Gleeson House was attached to the Sacred Heart Church at Campbells Hill, two or three kilometres from the Pro-Cathedral.
	
	
	The appellant and other residents of Edmund Gleeson House followed a regular daily routine. On weekdays they rose early in order to be in church by 6.15am for morning prayers followed by a 7.00am Mass. They then had breakfast, and left in cars at 8.00am to travel to Newcastle University. Two nights a week the appellant attended evening lectures that finished at 9.00pm. On Fridays the sisters at a local hospital provided them with meals for the weekend, which the appellant picked up. Saturday mornings were occupied with household chores. The residents then lunched together before attending lectures given by the Redemptorists, an Order of priests who conducted Edmund Gleeson House. After a little free time they travelled together to a Catholic establishment in Newcastle. On Sundays they attended two Masses, at 7.00am and 9.00am, at the Sacred Heart Church at Campbells Hill. The appellant said that on one (one only) occasion in 1982 he attended the Pro-Cathedral for a Vigil Easter Mass. He did this as part of the congregation. He had no role in officiating in the Mass, and wore civilian, not priestly, clothes. He occasionally assisted as an altar server at Campbells Hill (not at the Pro-Cathedral), when he wore the traditional altar service outfit. He never wore this at the Pro-Cathedral.
	
	
	The appellant said that his University vacations were spent working at the Mater Hospital at Newcastle. He denied ever having set foot in the St John’s Primary School at Maitland.
	
	
	In 1983 the appellant joined St Patrick’s College, Manly, a seminary in order to train for priesthood. He lived in the seminary. During that year he returned to Maitland on three occasions: for his graduation from Newcastle University, when he was notified that Gavin Smith’s death was imminent, and again in October for his own institution as an acolyte. In respect of that event, he participated in the ceremony, on the altar. That was the only occasion in 1983 that he participated in a Mass at the Pro-Cathedral. He could not recall attending the Pro-Cathedral on any other occasion in 1983.
	
	
	The appellant had no recollection of attending the Pro-Cathedral in 1984, although he accepted that he would have done so, for example, for the ordination of a colleague if one had taken place.
	
	
	The appellant was ordained as a priest in December 1986; that ceremony took place at the Pro-Cathedral.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence about the camps for Gavin Smith. He said that the first took place between 28 December 1982 and 6 January 1983. DP was not present. Gavin Smith died in September 1983. The second camp took place between late December 1984 and January 1985. DP was not present. The appellant denied conducting any “tick and leech inspections”.
	
	
	It will be seen that the evidence of DP and the evidence of the appellant was in direct conflict in a number of respects. The following factual issues emerged:
	



	
	whether the appellant was, in 1982 and/or 1983, a priest;
	
	
	whether, in 1982 and/or 1983, the appellant participated in Masses at the Pro-Cathedral;
	
	
	whether the appellant attended, or played any role at, St John’s Primary School;
	
	
	whether DP was present at the camp that followed the death of Gavin Smith.
	



	
	In addition to those conflicts thrown up by the evidence of DP and the appellant, an issue emerged as to whether DP had ever been an altar boy at the Pro-Cathedral.
	
	
	These issues cannot be resolved by reference only to the evidence of the two protagonists. It is necessary to look to other evidence that casts light on any of these issues. That is not because it is necessary for this Court to resolve a factual issue - nor, indeed, was it necessary for the jury to resolve each factual issue. However, the prosecution case against the appellant with respect to DP’s allegations depended, if not entirely, then very heavily, on DP’s evidence. The factual conflicts must be examined in order to determine whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt of counts 1 to 8.
	


Issue 1: was the appellant a priest in 1982-1984?

Did the appellant attend the Pro-Cathedral at 1982-1984?


	
	It was critical to DP’s evidence, and to the Crown’s proof of counts 1 to 7, that the appellant was routinely present at the Pro-Cathedral at some time between 1982 and 1984, the dates specified in the indictment. It was, in my view, not so critical that he was present in the role of a priest, although it was implicit in DP’s evidence that he wore priestly clothing.
	
	
	There was some evidence to support the account given by DP. Peter Gogarty said that he attended the Pro-Cathedral during the 1980’s. He had known the appellant at school, and was reacquainted with him as a “trainee priest”, at the Pro-Cathedral. He recalled the appellant, dressed in a white smock, participating in Masses at the Pro-Cathedral. He did not know DP.
	
	
	Gary Groves gave evidence to similar effect. He attended the Pro-Cathedral as a child. He recalled, at the age of 6 of 7 (1982-1983) being urged by his father to become an altar boy, and being introduced to the appellant as “a trainee priest”. He recalled that the appellant dressed differently to other priests, more like an altar boy. He did not know the appellant well; the appellant “came in and out of the parish quite often and quite frequently”. He said his family were more involved with Father Wilson and Father Fletcher.
	
	
	DP’s sister, Leah Wilton, also gave some indirect evidence about the appellant’s role at the Pro-Cathedral. She said that she and her mother attended the Pro-Cathedral, and she recalled DP being an altar boy there. She recalled the appellant being present.
	
	
	Notwithstanding that evidence, there is another body of evidence that renders DP’s evidence highly suspect.
	
	
	The priest referred to as Father Wilson gave evidence in his present (at date of trial) capacity of Archbishop of Adelaide. His evidence was that he moved into the Bishop’s house (which was opposite the Pro-Cathedral) in February 1983. Prior to that, he had been living in the Bishop’s residence in Newcastle, but, on an occasional basis, travelled with the Bishop to celebrate Mass at the Maitland Pro-Cathedral. From 1983 Father Wilson celebrated Mass in the Pro-Cathedral.
	
	
	Father Wilson first met the appellant as a school student in 1975. He had no recollection of contact with the appellant after that, but thought it likely that he would have had some such contact while the appellant was in residence at Edmund Gleeson House. He recalled the appellant being present at a ceremony to mark the closing of Edmund Gleeson House at the end of 1982. Significantly, he had no recollection of the appellant attending Mass at the Pro-Cathedral, or of being an altar boy there.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence that, in 1983, he was in residence at St Patrick’s College Manly was supported by Ex DD, a “timeline” issued by a Child Protection and Professional Unit of the Catholic Diocese of Maitland/Newcastle, and tendered in the prosecution case. That document shows that, (as he said) between 1983 and 1985 the appellant was enrolled in St Patrick’s College at Manly, that he was ordained as a Deacon in December 1985 and that he served in that capacity at Waratah and Singleton in 1985, was ordained as a priest in December 1986, and appointed to Muswellbrook in January 1984.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence concerning his routine at Edmund Gleeson House was largely corroborated by a Crown witness, Mark Newell. Mr Newell also lived at Edmund Gleeson House in 1981, and attended Newcastle University. He said that (like the appellant) he attended Sacred Heart Church at Campbells Hill. In 1982 Mr Newell lived in Newcastle, contemplating his future, but rejoined the appellant at St Patrick’s College at Manly in 1983, in the same intake as the appellant.
	
	
	Also present at Edmund Gleeson House during 1981 and 1982 was James Lunn, who also attended Newcastle University. His evidence was that the days commenced with morning prayers and Mass, and the trip by car to Newcastle. He thought that the cars returned between 4.00 and 5.00pm. He said that the appellant assisted in the instruction of altar boys, not at the Pro-Cathedral, but at Campbells Hill. He recalled attending the Pro-Cathedral for special events such as Easter Liturgy, but not otherwise. He was not aware of the appellant having any involvement with the Pro-Cathedral.
	
	
	Mr Edmund Belcher gave evidence that, in the early 1980’s, he attended the Pro-Cathedral. He had two sons who were altar servers and two daughters who were choristers. The priests involved in the training of his sons was Father Wilson and Father Fletcher. He could not recall the appellant being involved. He thought that he had been introduced to the appellant, and that he saw him, for example at Easter ceremonies. He saw the appellant at the Pro-Cathedral “probably only once or twice a year”. He was quite clear that the appellant was not involved in the Sunday Masses at the Pro-Cathedral.
	
	
	Another witness, Mr Brendan Dilley, gave evidence that he had been an altar boy at the Sacred Heart Church at Campbells Hill. (It will be recalled that DP had nominated a boy named “Dilley” as one who had trained with him at the Pro-Cathedral.) Mr Dilley said that the appellant trained him as an altar boy at St Paul’s at Rutherford. Mr Dilley had no recollection of DP as an altar boy. Mr Dilley said that he never saw the appellant acting as a priest at the Pro-Cathedral in 1982.
	
	
	(Mark Sarquis was another name given by DP as a fellow trainee altar boy at the Pro-Cathedral.) The “fresh evidence” the subject of ground 7A of the appeal was evidence given by Mark Sarquis at the latter trial of the appellant. Having regard to the view I have reached on this ground of appeal, it is unnecessary further to explore that proposed evidence.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence alone is sufficient to cast serious doubt on DP’s evidence in respect of these allegations. His account of his daily routine while living at Edmund Gleeson House in 1982 - attending Newcastle University on a daily basis, and attending church at Campbells Hill - left little room for regular attendances at the Pro-Cathedral. The evidence confirms that, in 1983 and 1984, the appellant was resident at St Patrick’s College in Manly. It was not logistically possible for him to have attended the Pro-Cathedral as regularly as, and in the capacity, asserted by DP. Even allowing some latitude in the dates given by DP, the possibility that, during any relevant time, the appellant was regularly present at the Pro-Cathedral is remote.
	
	
	The evidence establishes clearly that the appellant was not an ordained priest in 1982 or 1983. However, having regard to DP’s age at that time, I would not be inclined to regard his error in that regard as fatal to the Crown case with respect to the allegations concerning him. It is otherwise in respect of the appellant’s presence at the Pro-Cathedral during those years. It is impossible, on the whole of the evidence, to accept that the appellant was then present, on the regular basis asserted by DP. That conclusion fatally undermines the Crown case with respect to counts 1-7.
	
	
	There is, however, more.
	


Issue 2:  The appellant’s attendance at St John’s Primary School


	
	In cross-examination DP was firm that he had first encountered the appellant in the playground at St John’s Primary School. The appellant was equally firm that he had never set foot in that school. This evidence was not critical to the Crown case. It is, however, highly relevant to the assessment of DP’s credibility and/or reliability.
	
	
	Some support for the appellant’s position - sufficient to cast doubt on DP’s evidence - is to be gained from the evidence of two witnesses, both teachers at St John’s.
	
	
	Ms Christine Belcher was a teacher at St John’s from 1981 to 1983. She said that the school as a whole attended Mass at the Pro-Cathedral perhaps six or seven times a year. The Masses were conducted by Father James Fletcher, by the Bishop, or by Father Wilson. She did not recall ever seeing the appellant at the Pro-Cathedral. Masses were also conducted at the school. She could not remember the appellant conducting those Masses.
	
	
	It will be noted that Ms Belcher’s evidence was given in terms of not recalling the presence of the appellant at the Pro-Cathedral. Given the passage of time, this is hardly surprising. However, it must be recognised that it is not a definitive statement that the appellant was not there present. By contrast, Ms Belcher said that she did not see the appellant at the school; she thought that if he had been in the school grounds on a regular basis (as suggested by DP) she would have remembered. This casts doubt on DP’s evidence in this respect, although as I have said, the appellant’s presence at the school was not critical to the Crown case.
	
	
	The second witness was Mr John Chambers. In 1983 Mr Chambers was the senior primary teacher at St John’s. His role involved the supervision of the school grounds, partly in order to be available to parents who had matters to discuss. Mr Chambers said that if anybody he did not know came into the playground he would very quickly have been aware of it. He was not aware of the appellant ever coming to the school in 1983 or 1984. He said that he had never seen the appellant in the school. Mr Chambers knew the appellant’s family, having taught one of his siblings. He said that there was a strong family resemblance. He did not recall having met the appellant prior to 1985.
	


Issue 3:  DP at the Gavin Smith camp


	
	Count 8 on the indictment was the allegation of indecent assault committed by the appellant on DP at the Gavin Smith camp when, DP alleged, the appellant conducted a “tick and leech inspection”. Critical to the prosecution case with respect to count 8 was DP’s evidence that he had been present at the camp to commemorate Gavin Smith. His evidence in chief was that Gavin Smith died in 1984 and that the camp that he attended took place shortly after, sometime in 1984. In cross-examination DP assented to a question (possibly drawn from a statement made by him to police) that the camp was in late December 1983 and early January 1984.
	
	
	During the course of cross-examination DP was shown a photograph of some of the camp participants following a Mass on the last of the camp. He identified himself in the photograph. Later, after being shown an enlarged version of the photograph, he agreed that it was not him.
	
	
	There was no independent evidence, photographic, documentary or testimonial, to support DP’s assertion that he had been present at the camp. There was some evidence, other than that of the appellant, that suggested that he had not (although there were conflicts in this evidence). Two brothers, Jason and Mark Brimble, gave evidence of having been present at a camp. Jason Brimble was clear that the camp that he attended was a camp to commemorate Gavin Smith. His brother Mark was equally clear that the camp he attended was not held for that purpose (although he said that he went on only one camp with his brother). Each was clear that DP was not present at the camp that he attended. Because of the conflicts in the evidence, it is of limited value. Moreover, there is no apparent reason why these witnesses would, after almost three decades, have a clear recollection of who was not at a camp (as distinct from who was).
	
	
	Mr Dilley also gave evidence about the camps. He had himself attended both Gavin Smith camps, and another smaller camp, at which only four boys and the appellant were present. He did not recall DP being present at any of the camps.
	
	
	One piece of evidence relevant - peripherally - to this allegation was given by Mark Smith, an older brother of Gavin Smith. Mr Smith attended the first Gavin Smith camp (not the camp that DP claimed to have attended). What was significant (in this respect) in Mr Smith’s evidence was that he said that after the boys had been swimming, the appellant instructed them to line up for an inspection for ticks and leeches. That evidence was capable of adding credibility to DP’s account of what had happened at the camp he claimed to have attended.
	
	
	The appellant’s evidence was that the second camp was in late December 1984 to early January 1985. DP was not present.
	


Issue 4: was DP an altar boy at the Pro-Cathedral?


	
	It was central to the Crown case on counts 1-8 that DP was, in 1982-1983, an altar boy at the Pro-Cathedral. On this issue, having regard to his other evidence, the appellant himself could say nothing useful.
	
	
	That DP was an altar boy was supported by his sister, Leah Wilton. She recalled attending church with her mother, and said that DP was usually busy “doing altar boy stuff so we would just go watch”. She also recalled that he attended “altar boy practice” which she thought was on Wednesday or Thursday evenings. She recalled DP talking about the appellant as somebody with whom he did altar boy services.
	
	
	DP’s father (AP) was also called, and recalled DP attending the Pro-Cathedral. He also recalled him becoming an altar boy. AP himself did not attend the Catholic Church. He left the religious education of the children to his wife, who was a member of that church. DP’s mother was not called.
	
	
	Peter Gogarty, who said that he attended the Pro-Cathedral from about 1978 until 1987, said that he had never met DP. Gary Groves, who also attended the Pro-Cathedral, and who became an altar boy in about 1984 or 1985, gave no evidence of knowing DP.
	
	
	It is in respect of issues 3 and 4 that the significance of the evidence concerning DP’s congenital abnormality emerges. On behalf of the appellant it was argued that, for that reason, it was likely that DP would have been noticeable, and would have been remembered. That he was not remembered, either at the camp, or as an altar boy, suggested that his evidence in those respects could not be accepted.
	
	
	There is, in my opinion, only very minor force in this argument. The evidence did not disclose when DP underwent the surgery to correct the condition, except that it was when he was a child. Certainly, his evidence was that other children at his school knew of the condition, and teased him, but there is nothing to suggest that children at the Church or the camp did so.
	
	
	There were other, perhaps less significant, discrepancies. By way of example, DP’s evidence was that Mass at the Pro-Cathedral was held on Sunday afternoons or evenings. The appellant’s researches suggested that this was not so. That evidence, however, was far from conclusive.
	
	
	There were, therefore, in a number of respects, sharp conflicts in the evidence. DP, Peter Gogarty and Gary Groves all placed the appellant squarely in the Pro-Cathedral, on a regular and frequent basis, during 1982 and 1983. Ms Wilton, by indirect evidence, did likewise. I am fully conscious of the advantage that the jury had in observing these witnesses as they gave their evidence. This is one of those cases in which that advantage must be given full weight.
	
	
	Even with that in mind, their evidence is not, I have concluded, sufficient to overcome the doubt that must attend DP’s evidence of the appellant’s presence at the Pro-Cathedral in 1982 and 1983. The evidence of the appellant’s daily activities in 1982 casts considerable doubt upon the contrary evidence of DP. The evidence of the appellant’s residence at St Patrick’s College in Manly in 1983 is simply irreconcilable with DP’s evidence. Added to this are the very real doubts concerning DP’s attendance (or otherwise) at the Gavin Smith camp, and the evidence concerning the appellant’s attendance (or otherwise) at St John’s Primary School.
	
	
	In my opinion, the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt about all of DP’s allegations. In respect of counts 1-8, the appeal should be upheld, the convictions quashed, and verdicts of acquittal entered.
	


Ground 5: MB - unreasonable verdict (counts 14-21)


	
	The counts concerning MB allege offences committed between 18 April 1990 and 11 March 1991 at Kitchener and Cessnock. The Crown case with respect to those counts can be recapitulated was as follows.
	
	
	In April 1990 the appellant was assigned to the Cessnock parish as assistant priest. The senior priest was Father Vince Ryan. The appellant and Father Ryan shared living quarters at the Cessnock presbytery.
	
	
	MB was born in March 1980 and grew up in the Cessnock area. He attended St Patrick’s Primary School, and St Joseph’s Church in Cessnock. In year 3 MB became an altar boy. He first met the appellant in the school playground. By this time MB was exhibiting behavioural problems at school. A teacher considered that he might benefit from greater involvement in the Church. Eventually, he was referred to the appellant. The appellant suggested that the two should play squash together, and MB acceded to this. They played squash once or twice a week. It was the appellant’s practice to pick up MB from his home, at about 5.00pm, and drive him to the squash court at the local Police and Community Youth Club (“PCYC”). The appellant drove a white sedan, either a Holden Apollo or a Camry. This occurred over about three months. Thereafter, instead of going to squash, the appellant drove MB to Kitchener Park. The two sat in the car and talked about MB’s behaviour, and how it could be improved. MB trusted the appellant and felt good in his company. On other occasions, the appellant drove MB to the Cessnock presbytery where he lived. Again, they discussed MB’s behaviour, and how it could be improved. The appellant told MB not to reveal to his parents that he was not going to squash.
	
	
	MB then gave evidence of five separate occasions on which the appellant committed sexual offences against him. The first and fourth occasions were at Kitchener Park. The second, third and fifth were at the presbytery. The offences involved various forms of sexual activity, including masturbation and oral sex.
	
	
	On the first occasion, at Kitchener Park, the appellant told MB to relax, that everything would be “okay”. He also told him that what was happening was their “little secret” and that, in any event, nobody would believe MB if he did say anything. He told MB that it was “what God wants” and would “make things better”. MB said that he thought that what was happening was “gross”, but that he trusted the appellant. After this, the appellant drove MB home.
	
	
	The next offence of which MB gave evidence took place at the presbytery. This was not the first time that the appellant had taken MB to the presbytery. On previous occasions, nothing untoward had occurred.
	
	
	Again, the appellant picked MB up to play squash, but instead took him to the presbytery, and into his room. After some conversation the appellant had MB perform oral sex him. He again reassured MB that everything would be “okay”, and told him to relax, and that their “little secret” had become a “big secret”, and that MB was not to tell anybody, not even his sister. MB said that he felt “pretty disgusting”, but did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The appellant then drove MB home.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to go into the detail of the other occasions. It is clear from MB’s evidence that each incident occurred after the appellant had picked MB up from his home, ostensibly to take him to play squash.
	
	
	One of the incidents at the presbytery occurred a few days before MB’s 11th birthday. MB said that the appellant had organised an 11th birthday party for him which took place at the presbytery. About 10 or 12 boys attended. Nothing untoward occurred at the birthday party. However, after that, the appellant lost interest in MB, and “just vanished” from his life.
	
	
	MB gave evidence of a rather puzzling incident, which appears to have little direct relevance to the charges, but which must, for reasons that will appear, be recorded in some detail. MB’s account was this. Shortly before his 11th birthday, the appellant told MB that he had found a way to fix all his problems, but that MB had to agree to everything the appellant said. The appellant and MB then went to MB’s home and spoke to his parents. The appellant told them that MB had told the appellant that MB’s father had put a saddle on his back, and had whipped him around the horse yard at their property. Although MB had not told the appellant any such story, in compliance with the appellant’s instruction, MB did not deny having done so. Not only had MB not told such a story, such an event had not (and could not have) taken place.
	
	
	The “saddle story” surfaced 17 years later, at MB’s 28th birthday celebration at home. MB’s father, who had mentioned the incident from time to time over the years, again made reference to it, recounting it to his then partner. It was this that provoked MB, for the first time, to disclose the appellant’s sexual abuse. He did this with considerable violence of language. The following day MB spoke to his grandmother, who was still very involved with the church. As a result, MB made a formal complaint.
	
	
	In cross-examination, MB agreed that when he made his initial statement (presumably to police) in June 2008, he had fixed the events by reference to his 12th birthday. He subsequently realised his mistake and corrected the statement to refer to his 11th birthday. It was clear that all incidents of which he gave evidence occurred in the six months prior to his 11th birthday.
	
	
	Also in cross-examination, MB said that from the time he was in year 5 (1991), altar boy nights were held on either every second or every fourth Friday evening. Initially, they were organised by Father Ryan and another priest. Later the appellant became involved.
	
	
	MB was cross-examined about the appellant’s car, which he said in his examination in chief was white. After some cross-examination, he said “that’s how I remember it”.
	
	
	MB’s father (Mark B) gave evidence. I will confine the references to his evidence to that which is relevant to the factual issues raised under this ground of appeal. Mark B recalled being told by his wife that MB had been asked to play squash with the appellant at the PCYC. They gave their permission. He recalled MB playing squash with the appellant a couple of times a week over a period.
	
	
	Mark B’s account of the “saddle story” varied in some respects from that of MB. He said that a conversation with the appellant occurred. It took place on a Sunday evening, after MB had gone to bed. The appellant came to the door and told him that MB had said that Mark B had put a saddle on him, and whipped him around the paddock. He said that his reaction was of incredulity. He said the appellant asked his wife if it could have happened, and she had the same reaction as he had had.
	
	
	Mark B also gave an account of MB’s 28th birthday, when his mention of the incident provoked an angry disclosure from MB.
	
	
	MB’s mother (GH) also confirmed that MB had asked for permission to play squash with the appellant, and that permission was given. She said that either she drove MB to the squash courts, or the appellant picked him up at home. She said that, for MB’s 11th birthday, the family had had a celebration, and that there was another one, with other altar boys, which she believed was at the parish hall.
	
	
	Her recollection of the “saddle story” conversation with the appellant was consistent with that of Mark B in that MB was not present.
	
	
	MB’s grandmother (BB) gave evidence. Of significance, she said that when MB first told her of the abuse, he said that any incident had taken place at his birthday party at the presbytery.
	
	
	Father Ryan was the parish priest in Cessnock from April 1988 to January 1995. He lived at the presbytery, with an assistant priest who was, from 1990, the appellant. The two became (and remain) good friends. Father Ryan, himself was convicted of sexual offences against 27 different complainants. On behalf of the appellant, an attempt was made to suggest that MB had mistaken the appellant for Father Ryan. Father Ryan denied that MB was one of his victims. He said that he had been arrested twice; the second time, he made full disclosure of all of his victims. He said that only two of the 27 victims had been at Cessnock, and, at the time he made his disclosure, his time there was fresh in his memory. He was certain that he had had no contact with MB. He expressly denied playing squash with MB, denied entering the PCYC, and denied being at Kitchener Park.
	
	
	Two school friends of MB gave brief evidence. David Mitchell said that he had also been an altar server, and recalled that on Friday nights, either once a month or once a fortnight, the altar boys had a social gathering in the Church hall. Either Father Ryan or the appellant was present. Mr Mitchell also recalled being invited to MB’s 11th birthday party which was held in the presbytery. The appellant and Father Ryan were present.
	
	
	Jaron Apthorp was also a close friend of MB at school. He also said that he attended MB’s birthday party, in the presbytery. He recalled the appellant being present.
	


The appellant’s case


	
	With respect to the allegations made by MB, the appellant gave the following evidence. He denied playing squash with MB. He said that he did not know of Kitchener Park prior to hearing of these allegations. He said he had never been to MB’s house. He said he had never picked up MB to take him either to Kitchener Park or to the presbytery. His motor vehicle was not, as MB said, white. From 1989 until May 1991 he drove a red Camry. Father Ryan drove a white Holden Commodore.
	
	
	The appellant’s account of the “saddle story” was different to that of MB and his parents. He said that he had first met MB when visiting the school, as part of his priestly duties. He called on a particular teacher who he knew and liked and saw MB sitting outside the classroom, on a veranda, obviously in trouble. The teacher asked the appellant to talk to MB. When the appellant did so, MB told him that his father had put a saddle on his back, ridden him around the yard, and whipped him. The appellant thought this “bizarre”, but could not be ignored. He contacted Mark B and asked him to come with MB to the presbytery. Within a day or two, Mark B and MB did so. The appellant said that he was “terrified”, and in fear that Mark B would hit him; he therefore held the meeting in a reception room, and he arranged the seating strategically so that he had his back to the door as “an escape route”. It is to be noted that on the appellant’s account, not only did the conversation take place, not at the B household, but at the presbytery, but also that MB’s mother GH was not present. He said that Mark B received the information calmly and sensibly, and pointed out that it was not physically possible for what was described to have happened; he said that MB habitually made up such stories. The appellant said again that he had never been inside B home. The appellant denied playing any part in arranging MB’s birthday party. He said that, in 1991 early March (when MB’s birthday fell) was Lent and a very busy time, with meetings and services and events. He said that he was aware that Father Ryan involved himself with altar boy nights on Fridays but that he did not.
	
	
	Ms Alberta McGowan gave evidence in the defence case. She lived in Cessnock, not far from the presbytery, and had sons who were altar servers. She assisted in cleaning the Church and the hall. Prior to the appellant’s arrival she took on the maintenance of the garden. She did this on weekday afternoons, after her children had come home from school, and left at about 5.00pm. From time to time she saw the appellant come and go from the presbytery. She did not recall ever seeing the appellant with children. She confirmed that the appellant drove a red car.
	
	
	Ms McGowan said that she did see Father Ryan coming and going with children. She did not recall the appellant being involved in sporting activities.
	


The appellant’s arguments in support of ground 5


	
	It was acknowledged that the appellant’s case in respect of the MB allegations is not as “overwhelming” as that in respect of the DP allegations. It was, however, maintained that the court ought to entertain a reasonable doubt, as the jury should have. A number of arguments, of varying degrees of force, were raised. They were:
	



	
	it was unlikely that the appellant and MB could have entered the presbytery in the afternoons without being observed by Ms McGowan, who was regularly in the garden and who did observe Father Ryan entering the presbytery with young boys;
	
	
	the evidence established that the appellant drove a red car, contrary to MB’s evidence that his car was white;
	
	
	the Crown called no witness from the PCYC to confirm that the appellant had played squash on a regular basis with a young boy;
	
	
	the Crown called no patron from a hotel near Kitchener Park, nor any neighbour from the vicinity, to confirm that the appellant had been observed parking nearby with a 10 year old boy;
	
	
	given the strict rules imposed by the appellant in respect of the youth groups, it was unlikely that his involvement with a young boy would have escaped attention;
	
	
	it was unlikely that the appellant would have concocted the “saddle story”; the more likely scenario was that it was MB, as a child, who concocted the story, and this made it more likely that he also concocted the allegations of sexual misconduct in direct response to his father’s mention of the story at his 28th birthday. Further, the corroboration by his parents of the “saddle story” cast doubt upon their credibility generally, including their evidence that MB had played squash with the appellant;
	
	
	details of the sexual misconduct with MB were different in many respects from those made by other complainants, for example there was no allegation of wrestling, nor of invocation of God’s will;
	
	
	there was limited support MB’s assertion that the appellant attended altar boy Friday evenings, and it was contrary to the evidence of others;
	
	
	MB initially claimed that the offences took place before his 12th birthday, at which time the appellant had left the Cessnock parish;
	
	
	MB’s assertion that the appellant arranged his birthday was not supported by any independent adult;
	
	
	MB’s grandmother said that, when he made his disclosures to her, he said that the offences had been committed at his birthday party;
	
	
	the evidence showed that the appellant was too busy during the relevant period to have been able to engage in the activities alleged.
	


Consideration 


	
	Points (iii) and (iv) can be quickly disposed of. These events allegedly took place in 1991, 21 years before the evidence was called, and many years before the investigations began. There is no reason to think that anybody from the hotel at Kitchener, or anybody from the PCYC, could have made observations of the kind suggested, or if they had, would be likely to have recalled them and been available to the Crown. Point (v) appears to be a reference to evidence given by the appellant himself, concerning his time at Muswellbrook when he arranged a youth group at which, he said, he insisted that parents be involved to a significant degree. No evidence was identified that he adopted a similar practice at Cessnock, and no evidence was identified that supported that evidence given by him.
	
	
	The “saddle story” appears to be relied on as the foundation for a chain of propositions, culminating in the proposition that MB’s parents were part of an agreement to give false evidence against the appellant. At trial, in final address, senior counsel for the appellant relied upon MB’s response to his father at his 28th birthday that “I made that up as a cry for help”. When that evidence was properly read, it is clear that what MB was saying to his father was that his somewhat violent response to the reference to the “saddle story” was “a cry for help”. In fact, on the statement made by his father (elicited in cross-examination) MB denied that his account was a story; he said it was “a cry for help”. Point (vii) appears again to raise the strength of the tendency evidence, drawing distinctions between the nature of the offences alleged by other complainants from those alleged by MB. It is true that there are differences; there are also similarities. It was quite open to the jury to consider that the similarities were significant. The offences against the various complainants were alleged to have been committed progressively over a period, and in different locations. For tendency evidence to have value, it is not necessary that the offences alleged be identical, or even similar. Small items of evidence may well have probative value although the extent and strength of the probative value will depend upon a variety of factors, and is, ultimately, a matter for the jury. It is not correct to say that there was no invocation of God’s will in relation to MB; MB said that the appellant told him that sexual activity was “what God wants” and would “make things better”.
	
	
	It is incorrect to assert, as was asserted in point (viii), that support for MB’s evidence that the appellant attended altar boy evenings on Fridays was “limited”. The evidence of Mr Mitchell was entirely consistent with the evidence of MB.
	
	
	Point (x) suggests that MB’s assertion that the appellant arranged his 11th birthday party was not supported by any “independent adult”, ignoring the fact that two of MB’s friends, who said they had been present at the party, gave significant support to the assertion that the appellant was present.
	
	
	Point (xii) is that the evidence showed that during the relevant period the appellant was too busy to become involved in sexual activity. This is unsupported by the evidence. It may be accepted that the period up to Easter (which was, that year, the end of March) is a busy one in the Catholic Church. MB’s allegations go back well before the commencement of Lent and, in any event, it is unlikely that the appellant could not have found time for these activities if that is what he sought to do.
	
	
	It is true that MB initially asserted that the appellant’s car was white. After cross-examination, this became “that’s how I remember it”.
	
	
	Finally, point (i) suggests that it was unlikely that the appellant and MB could have entered the presbytery during the afternoon without being observed by Ms McGowan. The evidence of MB was that the appellant picked him up from his home at about 5.00pm; Ms McGowan’s evidence was that she left the premises at about 5.00pm.
	
	
	It is of considerable significance that that appellant denied a number of factual assertions that received independent support. He denied playing squash with MB; that was contradicted by both of MB’s parents. He denied organising MB’s birthday party; that was contradicted by Mr Mitchell and Mr Apthorp. He denied taking part in the Friday evening altar boy social events; that also was contradicted by Mr Mitchell and Mr Apthorp.
	
	
	In my opinion, it was amply open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to counts 14 to 21 inclusive. Having reviewed the evidence, I have no doubt of the appellant’s guilt of the counts.
	


Ground 4: SM - unreasonable verdict (counts 9-13)


	
	Counts 9-13 allege offences against SM committed between 31 January 1987 and 28 December 1988 at Muswellbrook. The Crown case against the appellant in respect of SM may be briefly recapitulated as follows. SM was born in 1973. He lived in Muswellbrook, where he attended the St James Catholic Church and the St James Primary School. At about 7 or 8 years of age he became an altar boy, and continued in that role until age 14.
	
	
	In 1987 the appellant was assigned as a parish priest to Muswellbrook. Shortly after the appellant’s arrival, he organised a youth group, which SM joined. He was then in year 8 and aged 13.
	
	
	SM said that the appellant was “one of the boys”, and a “great friend”. One of the activities of the group in which SM participated was wrestling, which was taught by the appellant.
	
	
	SM was having some difficulties at home, and told the appellant that he was “not doing too well at the time”, and was suffering from stress, anxiety and depression. The appellant invited him to the presbytery to have some talks. On three separate occasions SM went to the presbytery. Nobody else was present, although another priest lived at the presbytery at the time. On each occasion SM and the appellant talked for a time, after which the appellant suggested wrestling. On each occasion, the wrestling was followed by a sexual offence. It is not necessary to repeat the details of the nature of the sexual offences. SM said that he thought the appellant’s conduct was “disgusting”, and that the appellant was “a sick freak”. He did not tell anybody at the time because he thought it was shameful, and he was scared. He returned on subsequent occasions because the appellant was the only person he had to talk to, from whom to obtain some assistance with respect to his personal difficulties.
	
	
	SM said that on each occasion he went to the presbytery he knocked on the front door and the appellant let him in.
	
	
	SM said that, after the last occasion, he took the appellant’s head in a headlock, squeezed him until he gave in, and then left. Thereafter, he had no further contact with the appellant.
	
	
	In cross-examination, SM was pressed to confirm his evidence that he had knocked on the front door of the presbytery in order to gain access. The following exchange in cross-examination is recorded in the transcript:
	


“Q.  Are you sure about that?

A.  I would have knocked or a bell, whatever it was, it would have been obviously to get the attention of whoever it was, [the appellant] inside, so.

Q.  Well can you remember?

A.  Knocking.

Q.  We don’t want you just to take a stab at this, if you can’t remember, then tell us?

A.  It would have been obviously that is to me just to get the attention of someone inside so either knocking or pressing a bell so, what, just to get the attention of [the appellant] inside.

Q.  In other words you don’t remember?

A.  To be 100% specific, no.

Q.  But your best recollection is you knocked?

A.  Yes.”


	
	SM also agreed in cross-examination that, in 1988, he and a group of others went on a skiing trip. It was put to him that the appellant was also present, but he was not sure that that was so.
	
	
	SM said that he first told his mother about the sexual offences when he was about in his mid 20s. The evidence of SM was significantly corroborated by his mother, who recalled occasions when he had gone to the presbytery in order to wrestle with the appellant.
	


The defence case


	
	The appellant not only denied having committed any sexual offence against SM; he denied that SM had ever been alone with him at the presbytery. He took issue, for example with SM’s evidence that when he attended the presbytery he knocked on the door. The appellant’s evidence was that there was an aluminium screen door (which may have been a security door) with a bell to one side. He said that the building was of sandstone and that:
	


“there was no chance on earth of anyone hearing anyone knocking at the front door.”


	
	He also gave evidence that, in September 1988, he took a group on a trip to the Snowy Mountains. SM was a member of that group.
	
	
	He gave evidence about the formation of the youth group. He said that he had insisted on the involvement of parents in the activities of the group.
	


The appeal


	
	It was acknowledged in the appellant’s written submissions that his case in respect of counts 9-13 is less forceful than that in relation to counts 1-8. It is not entirely easy to follow the argument that was advanced. It seems to me that the argument was to the following effect:
	



	
	it was inconsistent behaviour for SM to return to the presbytery on the second and third occasions after having been sexually assaulted by the appellant, and to have attended the Snowy Mountains skiing trip and other events with the appellant after the commission of the offences;
	
	
	the allegations made by SM were different from the allegations made by other complainants, particularly DP and MB. (As best I could understand, this was intended to be an argument about the strength of the tendency evidence, although it was never so articulated.);
	
	
	there were some inconsistencies in the detail of evidence given by SM, such as when he was confused, and when he disclosed the offences to his mother.
	



	
	Attention was drawn to some confusion in SM’s evidence about when he had first made a complaint (to this mother) about the appellant’s conduct. On this issue he was cross-examined at considerable length. Just how this bore upon the core allegations is unexplained.
	
	
	It was submitted that SM’s evidence was unreliable, and insufficient to found the convictions.
	
	
	I do not accept this argument. This is a case in which the jury had ample opportunity to observe the witnesses, and to consider and weigh up the competing evidence. I have carefully considered the evidence of SM, and of the appellant. I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to convict on these counts. My review of the evidence satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant committed the offences. I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 6: JC - unreasonable verdict (counts 22-23)


	
	Two offences against JC were alleged by the Crown, committed between 27 July 1991 and 31 January 1993, the first at Windale and the second at Lake Macquarie. The Crown case was as follows.
	
	
	JC was born in June 1979. He attended St Pius Catholic Primary School at Windale, where he became an altar boy. From year 7 he attended St Mary’s Catholic School at Gateshead. In July 1991 the appellant was appointed as parish priest at Windale, where he remained until early 1994. He took the altar boy classes. In order to earn extra money, JC mowed the lawns at the presbytery. He became friendly with the appellant. They talked together, “had some fun”, and wrestled in the lounge room of the presbytery. After wrestling, they showered. Usually, when JC showered, he was alone in the shower. But on one occasion when the appellant was showering he asked JC to join him and play a game. The game involved spitting on each other. Both were wearing underwear. Although JC spat at the appellant, he declined to have the appellant spit at him, because he found it “repulsive”. This conduct occurred on three occasions. It is the subject of only one charge, count 21.
	
	
	The offence the subject of count 23 occurred on an altar boy camping trip JC made with the appellant. JC said that the camp was at Lake Macquarie, probably later in 1991. JC shared a tent with the appellant. They slept in separate sleeping bags. One night JC awoke to find the appellant on top of him, his penis erect, and the appellant “gyrating” slowly. JC asked the appellant what he was doing; the appellant replied that he was just lying on top of JC. JC told him to get off. The appellant asked to be allowed to lie on top of JC. JC refused and told him to go away.
	
	
	Also present at the camp were an older boy, Christopher Grahame, and Christopher’s father George Grahame. On the day after the event, JC told both Christopher and George Grahame of what had happened. They told him that he must have been dreaming and to forget about it. He did not tell anybody else for about six years, when he told his brother. He did not tell his brother about the spitting episodes.
	
	
	In cross-examination, JC agreed that it was possible (although he could not remember) that another boy, Simon Walsh, was present at the camp.
	
	
	After their return to Windale, JC continued to mow the lawn at the presbytery and continued to wrestle with the appellant. He still liked him and thought of him as a role model.
	
	
	In cross-examination it was put to JC that he had had a difficult childhood, and had experienced two highly traumatic events. One was a serious assault upon him at the hands of his father. The second was a motor vehicle accident in which he, as a pedestrian, had been knocked over by a car, suffering significant and long enduring effects. These events were put as providing the foundation for a suggestion that he had somehow fabricated (if unwittingly) his allegations against the appellant. It was expressly put to him that both allegations against the appellant were the result of a dream. He rejected that suggestion.
	
	
	He agreed that he continued to be friendly with the appellant until the appellant left the district. He said that he had “looked up to him”, and that he still did.
	
	
	JC’s mother also gave evidence, including evidence of the assault upon JC and the effect of the motor vehicle accident. In cross-examination JC expressed a low opinion of his mother, and said:
	


“Her words have always been misguided most of the time so I have had a hard time believing most of the things she says I’m sorry.”


	
	There was some confusion in the evidence about the camping trip. JC agreed that he had subsequently accompanied the appellant on another camping trip, at which JC’s brother was also present. JC’s brother recalled this because he had had a leech between his toes.
	
	
	JC’s brother gave evidence of the account given to him by JC some years after the event. He associated the camp with the leech incident.
	


The defence case


	
	The appellant denied each allegation made by JC. He said that, although he had been on two camps with JC, neither was at Lake Macquarie. He described in some detail one of the camps when, he said, it had rained heavily during the night so that he and JC took refuge and slept in his car. Both Christopher Graham and his father George gave evidence in the defence case. Christopher Graham’s evidence was that he had once - and once only - been camping with the appellant, at Frying Pan Creek, in Dungog - that is, not Lake Macquarie. He did not recall JC being present. He categorically denied having been told by any camp participant that he had been indecently or sexually assaulted by the appellant. George Graham also recalled the camp as being at Frying Pan Creek, which he had attended with his two sons and other children. He said there was heavy rain and the camp was called off after one night. He was equally firm in denying that he had been told of any indecent or sexual assault by the appellant. He said that, as a father, and “like any decent parent”, had he been informed of something like that, he would have investigated. He was not challenged on this evidence.
	
	
	Simon Walsh gave evidence of a camping trip, also at Frying Pan Creek, at which both JC and the appellant were present. One other boy was also present. Simon Walsh said that the three boys slept in one tent, the appellant in another. He said that on the last day of the camp Christopher Graham and his father arrived.
	


The appeal


	
	It will be seen that accounts of the camp varied considerably from witness to witness.
	
	
	The submissions made on behalf of the appellant as to why this Court ought to have (and the jury ought to have had) a reasonable doubt about JC’s allegations are again not easy to follow. Senior counsel described the spitting allegations as quite “bizarre”. He referred to JC’s evidence that he had had a good relationship with the appellant, and that, even when giving evidence, he said that he still “looks up to” the appellant. This seems to have been an attempt to cast doubt upon the credibility of JC’s allegations.
	
	
	Senior counsel also referred to JC’s “difficult youth”, apart from his contact with the appellant. This appeared to be a veiled suggestion of fabrication, although the logic was not articulated. In this context, reference was also made to JC’s evidence that his mother could not be believed (which somewhat overstates the evidence given by JC). JC’s mother had described the assault on JC by his father, which JC did not recall. There is no apparent connection between JC’s distrust of his mother and his allegations against the appellant.
	
	
	The strongest point made on behalf of the appellant concerned the evidence about the camping trip, particularly the evidence of the Grahams, denying any complaint of sexual assault by the appellant. In my opinion, if the Grahams had indeed brushed off JC’s report as summarily as JC claimed, it is quite likely that they would not recall the event. However, the evidence of George Graham that he would have investigated any such allegation was not challenged, and must be given due weight. Moreover, the evidence of Simon Walsh, while it does not establish that the camping trip to which he referred was the same trip as that to which JC referred, is sufficient to cast serious doubt on JC’s evidence.
	
	
	In my opinion, the discrepancies are such that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about JC’s allegations. Those convictions must be quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered.
	
	
	I would therefore uphold ground 6.
	


Grounds 3-6


	
	I have considered above the evidence in relation to each complainant separately. In relation to grounds 4 and 5, I have concluded that the evidence in each case amply supported the Crown case, and was such as to entitle the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. It is not to be overlooked that the evidence in each case was, in accordance with the ruling of this Court in DAO, admitted as tendency evidence in the case of each other complainant. Zahra DCJ gave appropriate directions in respect of the use the jury might make of the tendency evidence. No complaint is made about the content of those directions. The tendency evidence strengthened the Crown case in relation to each complainant. My conclusions above were drawn without regard to the tendency evidence.
	
	
	There is, however, a complication arising by reason of the view I have come to in relation to the allegations concerning DP and JC. Notwithstanding the admission of the tendency evidence, I have concluded that convictions on counts 1-8 and 22-23 cannot stand. The question that then arises concerns the impact of that conclusion on the convictions on the remaining counts.
	
	
	It might be argued that the tendency directions linked the cases concerning all four complainants in such a way as to make the convictions interdependent. That calls for examination of the directions that were given. Zahra DCJ outlined the tendency upon which the Crown relied. He then said:
	


“Ladies and gentleman this evidence is before you because the Crown says there is a pattern of behaviour that reveals that the accused has a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind. Namely the Crown alleges that the evidence sought to be relied upon would demonstrate firstly that the accused was a person who had a sexual attraction towards male children. Secondly that he identified male children who were having difficulties at home or at school and thirdly that the accused gave attention to those children by way of specialised, individualised attention or counselling and then engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct.

The evidence of the accused having that tendency can only be used by you in the way the Crown asks you to use it if you make two findings beyond reasonable doubt. Firstly, the first finding is that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of the acts occurred. In making that finding you do not consider each of the acts in isolation but consider all the evidence and ask yourself whether you satisfied that a particular act relied upon actually took place.

If you cannot find that any of these acts is proved beyond reasonable doubt then you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had the tendency advanced by the Crown.

If you do find beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of those acts occurred then you go on to consider the second finding. Secondly you ask yourself whether from the act or acts that you have found proved you can infer or conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the tendency that the Crown alleges.

If you cannot draw that inference or conclusion beyond reasonable doubt then again you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had the tendency alleged.

So if having found one or more of the acts attributed to the accused to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and you can from the proved act or acts infer or conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the tendency to act in the particular way or had the state of mind that the Crown alleges you may use the fact of that tendency or state of mind in considering whether the accused committed the offences charged. That is if you were satisfied that the accused did have that tendency then that would lend support to the evidence of those complainants who are the subject of specific charges in the indictment. The evidence must not be used in any other way. It would be completely wrong to reason that because the accused has committed one crime or has been guilty of one matter, he is therefore generally a person of bad character and for that reason must have committed the offences. That is not the purpose of the evidence at all.”


	
	In my opinion, in these remarks, Zahra DCJ emphasised that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to each of the offences alleged. In the final two sentences he took a good deal of the sting out of the tendency evidence.
	
	
	It is also necessary to examine the nature of the evidence called by the Crown in relation to each complainant. As will appear from the analyses above, the Crown case in relation to DP and JC was shown to have serious deficiencies. That was not so in relation to the Crown case concerning MB and SM. In each of those cases the Crown case was strong. This would have been apparent to the jury.
	
	
	However, I am unable to exclude the real possibility that the jury used the flawed cases in respect of the allegations of DP and JC in support of their conclusions on the allegations of MB and SM. The inevitable result is that those convictions must also be quashed. It does not follow that verdicts of acquittal ought be entered in respect of those counts on the indictment. The appropriate order is that there be a new trial of those counts.
	


Ground 7A: fresh evidence


	
	The fresh evidence sought to be admitted concerned only the convictions with respect to counts 1-8. It is therefore unnecessary to consider this ground.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	The appeal against the conviction is allowed;
	
	
	The convictions and sentences in respect of counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 22 and 23 are quashed, and verdicts of acquittal entered;
	
	
	The convictions and sentences in respect of counts 9 to 21 inclusive are quashed;
	
	
	In respect of those counts there be a new trial.
	



	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Simpson J.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Simpson J.

2764296,New South Wales Crime Commission v Yu Hai Li [2014] NSWSC 926,"Judgment
1This is an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW).  Section 10A enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force while there is an application pending for a proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act. 
2The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 8 July 2014.  In that affidavit, Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities, namely, supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) and (2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).  Both of those offences are serious criminal offences pursuant to s 6(2)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.  
3Mr Spark bases his suspicion on his having read a statement of facts prepared by the police when the Defendant was arrested and brought before the Local Court.  Mr Spark deposes to a conversation and email exchange with the police officer responsible for the preparation of those facts who confirmed that he prepared the facts in conjunction with another police officer, that the contents of the facts sheet were true, and the information contained in the facts sheet was obtained as a result of the investigation described in the facts sheet. 
4I have also read the facts sheet and I am satisfied that the suspicion that Mr Spark deposes to is held on reasonable grounds.  In those circumstances, under s 10A(5) of the Act, the Court must make a restraining order.  
5The application is made ex parte.  I have read what Mr Spark says, based on his long experience, of the ability of persons to dispose of and transfer property very quickly.  I am satisfied that it is appropriate that the application should be made without notice to the Defendant.  The Defendant, in any event, has rights under s 10C to apply to the Court in respect of the orders that have been made. 
6I note that the Plaintiff gives the usual undertaking as to damages and upon that undertaking, I make the orders contained in paragraphs 1 to 8 of the draft order. **********

2764299,New South Wales Crime Commission v Sammak [2014] NSWSC 925,"Judgment
1This is an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW).  Section 10A enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application pending for a proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act.  
2Under s 10A(5), the Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit by an authorised officer identifying that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime-related activity, that the authorised officer has a suspicion on reasonable grounds that the Defendant has so engaged and that the property sought to be restrained is illegally acquired property. 
3The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 10 July 2014.  He deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity, that being the supply of a prohibited drug of an amount greater than the commercial quantity contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1990 (NSW).  That is an offence defined as a serious criminal offence pursuant to s 6(2)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act. 
4Mr Spark deposes to an email exchange with the police officer responsible for preparing the statement of facts concerning the Defendant's offending.  The police officer confirmed in answer to Mr Spark's questions that he had prepared the contents of the facts sheet or was familiar with them, that the contents of the facts sheet were true, and that the sheet was prepared on information obtained by the police as a result of the investigation described.  
5The information in the facts sheet satisfies me that Mr Spark's suspicion is held on reasonable grounds. 
6One of the items of property was a piece of real estate at 2 St Simon Close, Blair Athol owned entirely by the Defendant.  Inquiries demonstrated that a contract for sale was entered into for that property on 23 June 2014.  In ordinary circumstances, the purchaser of that property would have an interest in the outcome of this application.  However, the purchaser's interest has, in my opinion, been satisfactorily met by the form of the orders proposed.  The intention is that sale will be allowed to proceed in the ordinary course, but that the proceeds of sale after the deduction of certain stipulated matters which may be summarised as the amounts necessary to discharge encumbrances on the property and the costs and expenses associated with the sale, will thereafter be restrained. 
7The Court is also required to consider whether notice should be given to the Defendant for the making of the application.  I note what Mr Spark says in his affidavit concerning the speed with which property may be disposed of.  Mr Spark has long experience in the area and I accept that evidence.  I consider it is appropriate that no notice should be given to the Defendant.  The Defendant in any event, has his rights for a review under s 10C of the Act. 
8On the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking, and I note that it has been given, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 11 of the draft order.

2764300,New South Wales Crime Commission v Elhassan [2014] NSWSC 924,"Judgment

1This is an application for orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). Section 10A enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application pending for a proceeds assessment order under s 27. 

2Under s 10A(5), the Court must make a restraining order if the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer who deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime-related activity, and that suspicion is held on reasonable grounds as the Court determines. 

3The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 10 July 2014. Mr Spark deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime-related activity being the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). That offence is a serious criminal offence pursuant to s 6(2)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act. 

4Mr Spark bases his suspicion on his inquiry through the COPS records to show that the Defendant was charged with that offence and also on his reading of a statement of facts, prepared by the police concerned with the commission of that offence. Mr Spark emailed the police officer involved in the investigation to ask if he had prepared the statement of facts, if the statement of facts were true, and if the facts contained in the statement were obtained as a result of the police's investigation into the Defendant's commission of the offences. Mr Spark received affirmative answers to all of those questions. 

5I have read the statement of facts, and as a result, it seems to me that the suspicion that Mr Spark holds is a suspicion held on reasonable grounds. 

6The application is made ex parte and the Court must consider whether it is appropriate, but notice ought to be given to the Defendant before the interim orders are made. I am satisfied from what Mr Spark says in his affidavit about the speed with which unregistered mortgages can be created and property disposed of, that it is appropriate that the matter be heard without giving notice to the Defendant. The Defendant has rights under s 10C of the Act for a review of the orders. 

7Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking and I note that it is given, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 7 of the draft order.

		15 July 2014",2014-07-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764307,Ingham v R [2014] NSWCCA 123,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  In April 2008 the appellant was convicted after trial of eleven offences committed against two children, CBS aged 9 and JAW aged 8.  All offences were committed over the course of a weekend in October 2006 at CBS's home. 
3Eight of the eleven counts on the indictment alleged sexual intercourse with a person under 10 years of age contrary to s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (three committed against CBS and five against JAW); one count alleged an attempt to have sexual intercourse with CBS contrary to s 66B of the Crimes Act; and two counts alleged aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, one count each against CBS and JAW.  
4At the time of the offending the maximum penalty for offences contrary to s 66A(1) was 25 years imprisonment to which a standard non-parole period of 15 years applies: Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2003 (NSW).  The maximum penalty for each of the two offences contrary to s 61M(2) was 10 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  The maximum penalty for the offence against s 66B is 25 years imprisonment.  No standard non-parole period attaches to that offence.
5In September 2008 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for an effective term of 22 years and 4 months comprised of an effective non-parole period of 17 years and a balance of term of 5 years and 4 months.  
6The effective non-parole period was the inevitable result of ten of the eleven offences attracting a standard non-parole period (and eight of those a standard non-parole period of 15 years) and where the sentencing judge concluded that because there was nothing in the appellant's subjective circumstances mitigating the objective seriousness of mid range offending or offending above the mid range (a finding he made in respect of six offences) he was effectively obliged to impose the standard non-parole period.  When sentencing his Honour said:   ""As the law stands, because I have decided some of these offences are above the mid range, and some are at the mid range, and because Ingham did not plead guilty, I have in the circumstances very limited room to exercise any discretion to determine the length of the non-parole period. I must exercise the little discretion I have to decide a total sentence, by balancing periods of concurrence and periods of accumulation.""
7His Honour found three of the eight offences in breach of s 66A of the Crimes Act in the mid range (one offence involving cunnilingus of CBS and two offences of cunnilingus and fellatio involving JAW) and two offences in breach of s 66A(1) above the mid range (each involving penile penetration of one of the children).  For the three s 66A(1) offences in the mid range non-parole periods equivalent to the standard non-parole period of 15 years were imposed in each case with a balance of term of 5 years.  A non-parole period of 16 years was imposed on the two counts above the mid range in both cases with a balance of term of 5 years and 4 months.  The remaining three s 66A(1) offences, each involving digital penetration of both children, were found to be below the mid range in respect of which non-parole periods of 10 years were imposed with a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months.  For each of these sentences the balance of term was fixed in accordance with the statutory ratio in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  
8For the offence of attempted sexual intercourse contrary to s 66B for which no standard non-parole period applied, a non-parole period of 9 years with a balance of term of 3 years was imposed.  The fixed terms of 8 years for the two offences against s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act were quashed on appeal and non-parole periods and additional terms were fixed in accordance with the statutory ratio.
9The sentences for the five offences involving CBS were ordered to be served concurrently and the sentences for the six offences involving JAW were also to be served concurrently with each other.  There was an order for accumulation of 12 months between the sentences referable to CBS and those referable to JAW.  Since each child was the victim of one count of sexual intercourse assessed by his Honour as above the mid range and attracting a non-parole period of 16 years and a balance of term of 5 years and 4 months in each case, the order for accumulation of 12 months resulted in an effective non-parole period of 17 years against which a balance of term of 5 years and 4 months was fixed.  This exceeded the statutory ratio under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.   
10The sentencing judge wrongly attributed a standard non-parole period of 8 years to the two s 61M(2) offences.  This was the subject of one of the nine grounds upon which leave to appeal against sentence was sought in 2010 (Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88).  An appeal against conviction was dismissed.  Error in the attribution of the standard non-parole period for the two s 61M(2) offences was conceded by the Crown with the sentences on both counts quashed and the appellant re-sentenced on those counts.  There was no adjustment to the overall sentence on re-sentence as the substituted sentences on the two s 61M(2) counts were wholly subsumed by the undisturbed sentences on all other counts.  
11Error in the approach of the sentencing judge to a number of aggravating factors was also identified, although not attracting the intervention of the Court.  One of these concerned the fact that the offences were committed in CBS's home.  The Court held that since he was an invited guest this did not amount to aggravation for the purposes of s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act adopting the reasoning in EK v R [2010] NSWCCA 199; 79 NSWLR 740, 208 A Crim R 157 at [79] per RA Hulme J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing).  I note that more recently in Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214, RA Hulme J observed at [54] that even though the aggravating factor is limited to cases where an intruder has broken into the victim's home, where an assault involves, as it did here, violation of the expectation of safety and security in the home, the offence is more serious.
12Other grounds upon which the application for leave to appeal against sentence was advanced were dismissed including what was said to be error in the sentencing judge's assessment of the objective gravity of the offences attracting a standard non-parole period by reference to a ""mid range offence"" rather than an offence ""in the middle of the range"".  
13In dismissing the ground of appeal that challenged the individual sentences and the aggregate sentence as excessive McClellan CJ at CL (with whom James and Davies JJ agreed) said: 
""[126]  ... The sentences which were imposed by the sentencing judge are largely a result of the legislated standard non-parole periods for the particular offences and his Honour's findings in relation to the objective seriousness of each offence. The legislative regime has the inevitable consequence that the overall sentence would be severe. It is not for a sentencing judge or this Court to do other than sentence in accordance with the regime provided by the Parliament. 
[127]  The applicant submitted that the sentences imposed upon the applicant were severe. A table of ""comparable"" cases was provided and it was submitted that by reference to those decisions it could be demonstrated that the sentences passed upon the applicant were manifestly excessive. 
[128]  The applicant emphasised the decision in SGJ v R; KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258. It was submitted that the circumstances of the offences in that case were much worse than the present, involving as it did a greater number of offences, against 7 victims ranging in age from 5 to 10 years. In SGJ, some of the victims were contacted by advertising child minding services. The offences occurred over many months, were committed in company with a co-offender and were used to create a permanent photographic record in respect of 5 of the 7 victims. On appeal, the aggregate sentence of 22 years, consisting of a non-parole period of 15 years, and an additional term of 7 years was confirmed in the case of SGJ. However, in relation to KU, her sentence was reduced to include a non-parole period of 13 years with an additional term of 7 years. 
[129]  To my mind, the decision in SGJ and KU is not of great assistance. There are a number of differences between those two cases and the current case. Both SGJ and KU pleaded guilty to many of the counts. The present applicant pleaded not guilty. Both SGJ and KU had no history of committing offences of a sexual nature. The present applicant has a previous conviction for sexual assault upon a child under 10 in 1999. Furthermore, SGJ had a history of psychiatric illness associated with drug taking. The same is not true of the applicant, although I acknowledge that the applicant was diagnosed as having an avoidant personality disorder with some schizoid and self-defeating characteristics. Both SGJ and KU were remorseful for their actions. The same cannot be said for the applicant. In any event, the sentence imposed on SGJ of 22 years was the same as that imposed on the applicant although SGJ received a discount for his plea. 
[130]  In the result I have not found those decisions to be of particular utility in the sentencing of the offender. Each case has its own distinctive circumstances. The appropriate sentences for the appellant will reflect findings as to the circumstances of the offences, the appellant's subjective matters and the penalty regime provided by the Parliament. 
[131]  It is important to appreciate his Honour was required to sentence the appellant in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Having determined that an offence was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness in accordance with s 54A(2) his Honour was required by s 54B(2) to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless he determined that there were reasons for setting a different period. The sentencing judge determined that there were no reasons for setting a different non-parole period which contributed significantly to the sentence ultimately imposed.""
The facts
14At [7]-[11] and [13]-[18] McClellan CJ at CL sets out a convenient summary of the facts: 
""[7]   CBS's mother was separated from her husband. She regularly played tenpin bowls on Friday nights. The applicant was a friend of CBS's mother and had won her confidence. He often stayed the weekend with CBS's family, from Friday night until Sunday evening. He would entertain the children and (particularly on Friday nights) babysit them. 
[8]  CBS developed an infatuation for the applicant. Sometimes she slept in the same bed as him, and although her mother initially tried to discourage this, the sleeping arrangement was allowed to continue. At times the applicant bathed CBS and wrapped her in a towel. 
[9]  CBS and JAW were friends and spent a lot of time together. Evidence was led by the Crown as to sexual offences having been committed by the applicant against CBS and JAW on the preceding weekend to the offences of which the applicant was convicted. 
[10]  The offences were allegedly committed in CBS's bedroom during the night of 13 October 2006, a Friday. It was JAW's eighth birthday and she slept over at CBS's house. The applicant was babysitting while CBS's mother was at the tenpin bowling alley. Throughout the course of that night and the morning of 14 October, the two girls and the applicant watched television and slept in various places, moving from CBS's bedroom to the lounge room and back again. 
[11]  At times there were other adults present. JAW's aunt was there for a time, and at some stage CBS's mother and her partner came home from the tenpin bowling alley and went to the bedroom of CBS's mother. 
[12]  ...
[13]  JAW's aunt, LKW, gave evidence that she received a complaint from both JAW and CBS regarding sexual activity by the applicant towards them. JAW also made complaint to her uncle, DW. 
[14]  JAW was interviewed on 17 October 2006 and again on 6 November 2006. She gave an account of the events and stated that she had seen the applicant use a condom on his penis when committing offences on CBS. She saw the applicant get this item from his bag. She gave a description of the item and its wrapper consistent with that of a condom. She later saw the applicant dispose of the condom. 
[15]  CBS was interviewed on 18 October 2006 and again on 31 October 2006. She gave an account of events including that the applicant had obtained five condoms from his bag and used three of them on her during the evening and two on JAW the following morning. She saw ""white stuff"" in the condoms after they had been used. 
[16]  On 17 October 2006 police searched the premises and found two empty condom wrappers and five condoms in a recycling bin at CBS's home. These were taken for DNA testing. 
[17]  Police arrested the applicant on 20 October 2006 and he was interviewed. He denied the allegations and denied that he had been in possession of condoms at CBS's residence. The applicant provided a sample of his DNA to investigators. 
[18]  The condoms were tested. Semen was detected on four of the five condoms. DNA consistent with the profile of the applicant's DNA was found inside four of the five condoms. DNA consistent with the DNA profile of CBS was found on the outside of three of the condoms.""
15At [12] of his Honour's judgment the facts referable to the individual offences were extracted from the appellant's outline of submissions with which the Crown agreed.  To that summary of facts I have added the sentencing judge's findings as to the objective seriousness of each count and the sentences imposed by him (except counts 3 and 8 which were the subject of re-sentence):""...
Count 2: CBS woke to find the applicant sitting on his knees at the end of her bed as she was lying on her side facing the wall. He pulled her pants down to her knees and digitally penetrated her by putting fingers inside her vagina.  [This was the first s 66A offence involving CBS.  It was an act of digital penetration and was assessed as below the midrange.  It attracted a non-parole period of 10 years and a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months.]
Count 3: The applicant had been lying on top of CBS, who was lying on her back. He pulled up her pyjamas, pulled her bra up and, using his tongue, began to lick her breasts.  [This was the indecent assault involving CBS.  On re-sentence it attracted a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 1 year and 8 months.  That sentence expired on 19 June 2013.]
Count 4: The applicant had oral sexual intercourse with CBS by using his tongue to lick her vagina.  [This was the second s 66A offence involving CBS.  It was found to be offending in the midrange. It attracted a non-parole period of 15 years and a balance of term of 5 years.]
Count 5: The applicant pulled down CBS's pants as well as his own. Either he or CBS applied a condom to his penis, and he lay on top of CBS [put his penis into her vagina] and was ""humping and jumping"" on her, as described by JAW.  [This was the third s 66A offence involving CBS.  It was found to be offending above the midrange.  It attracted a non-parole period of 16 years and a balance of term of 5 years and 4 months.]  
Count 6: The applicant attempted sexual intercourse by way of fellatio, but he was unable to insert his penis into CBS's mouth because she refused to open her mouth.  [This was the only charge under s 66B.  It attracted a non-parole period of 9 years and a balance of term of 3 years.]
Count 7: The applicant was in CBS's bedroom with JAW and CBS, JAW was lying on her back on the bed. The applicant pulled his pants down, got on top of her, put his penis in her mouth and moved up and down with his penis.  [This was the first s 66A offence involving JAW. It was found to be offending in the midrange. It attracted a non-parole period of 15 years and a balance of term of 5 years.]
Count 8: JAW was on the bed in CBS's room, lying on her back. The applicant was lying next to her, between JAW and CBS. He pulled up JAW's top and sucked her breast.  [This was the indecent assault involving JAW.  On re-sentence it attracted a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 1 year and 8 months.  That sentence expired on 19 June 2014.  ]
Count 9: JAW was lying on her bed on her back. The applicant pulled her pants down, lay on top of her, and put his penis inside her vagina, moving up and down. JAW felt pain at the time because he was ""pushing it in"".  [This was the second s 66A offence involving JAW. It was found to be offending above the midrange. It attracted a non-parole period of 16 years and a balance of term of 5 years and 4 months.]  
Count 10: JAW was lying on her back. The applicant was lying next to her. He pulled her pants and underpants down and inserted his fingers into her vagina, moving his finger around and causing soreness to her vagina. Both JAW and CBS, trying to pull the applicant off JAW, kicked him off the bed. JAW attempted to scream but the applicant put his hand over her mouth.  [This was the third s 66A offence involving JAW. It was found to be offending below the midrange. It attracted a non-parole period of 10 years and a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months.]  
Count 11: JAW and CBS were in CBS's bed when the applicant entered the room. He pulled JAW's pants down and put his fingers in her vagina. She tried to push his hand away but he insisted.  [Same as count 10.]
Count 12: JAW was lying on the bed.  The applicant held onto her legs and licked her on the outside of the vagina, moving his tongue around.  [This was the fifth s 66A offence involving JAW. It was found to be offending in the midrange. It attracted a non-parole period of 15 years and a balance of term of 5 years.]""  
16The factors the sentencing judge took into account in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the individual offences and the appellant's subjective circumstances were are also extracted as follows:
""[91]  The sentencing judge said: 
""Firstly, I consider the overall narrative of what occurred on 13 and 14 October 2006 and all the surrounding circumstances which relate to each of the individual offences. I consider, for example, the background of the relationship between the offender and CBS's family, between the offender and CBS, as well as the background of the relationship which developed between the offender and JAW arising out of her relationship with CBS. 
I consider the sexual activities involving CBS on the weekend before, so that these offences, in my estimation, were not isolated incidents, not spur of the moment offences when the offender was suddenly overcome with sexual fantasy and drive. 
I take into consideration the position of trust enjoyed by Ingham vis--vis the CBS's family and both victims. He abused his position of trust. He ingratiated himself with a family, and with the children by entertaining them, by babysitting them, by showering presents on them, and then abusing that trust. 
I consider the degree of ...planning for the offence. The offender had had no sexual partner for two years, as appears from exhibit 1, a report from W John Taylor dated 31 July 2008, and yet he had condoms in his overnight bag. 
I consider the fact that all of the offences were committed in the presence of the other complainant, who on each occasion was under the age of eighteen years, and observed by each as her friend was being assaulted. I take account of the fact that the offences were committed in the home of one of the victims, which is also an aggravating factor; and that the offences were committed for the offender's own sexual gratification. 
The indecent assaults were carried out in the context of an intention to perform penile penetration, cunnilingus, digital penetration and fellatio. The overall sexual activity involved all those activities, as well as the application of a condom to at least one of the victims, and multiple acts over a period of two days. I consider that overall context when coming to a decision as to the objective seriousness of each offence, and where each one is positioned on a spectrum either side of a medium range offence. There was an element of force involved in at least one of the offences, where the offender placed his hand over the mouth of JAW to prevent detection, but there was no threat to ensure silence or nondisclosure. 
I consider also the two different victims. CBS was nine years and three months; JAW was just eight years old. The difference in age makes some difference in my assessment, since one girl was one year and three months younger than the other. It seems to me that the offences committed on JAW were somewhat more serious (because of the age at least) than those on CBS (though it is difficult to determine how much more) and in considering this factor, I am encouraged by the decision in R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 574, and RJA [2008] NSWCCA 137. 
I also consider that neither victim seems to have suffered serious physical damage. JAW presented no medical evidence on physical damage; CBS's medical evidence was of some redness - though I do note, young and all as the girls were at the time, there are victim impact statements in which CBS states, inter alia that when Heath was doing - 
""Those things to me, I thought I was not a person. I felt embarrassed and ashamed. I couldn't tell anyone because I thought I would get into trouble"". 
She said that she was very angry because Heath told her to do those things and what to do, and did not care about her..."" 
""In coming to some assessment of the objective seriousness and the place of each offence in relation to the mid range offence, I also take into account that there is no evidence as to how long each offence lasted; no evidence of any full penile penetration, only limited entry into the genital region. There is evidence however, of the nature of the sexual act, which can also be important since in general terms at least, penile penetration is considered more serious than digital; and in general terms, full penile penetration more serious than the fellatio or cunnilingus, but only in general terms, so that circumstances of course vary ..."". 
Subjective features
17His Honour summarised the appellant's subjective circumstances, drawn from the report of Mr Taylor, a clinical forensic psychologist, as follows:
""Exhibit 1 is a report dated 31 July 2008, of a clinical forensic psychologist W John Taylor.  According to the report, the offender was born in 1971 and is therefore thirty-seven years of age. He is single, never married, and has never had any significant relationship. His last casual relationship was with a girl when he was twenty-one. He is described by Mr Taylor as rather quiet. Ingham told him that even today he finds it hard to make friends and that, while he was at school he was frequently the victim of bullying. He moved around a good deal as his stepfather was in the army, and attended nine different schools. In primary school he had some learning difficulties due to dyslexia.
Since leaving school and since the age of eighteen, the offender has worked as a labourer in a mill, for two weeks; as a shelf stacker at supermarkets; a trolley collector; as a trainee at a long day care centre at Wollongong for six months, (which, I must say causes a cold shiver in my heart); at the Barnardo's Homes for twelve months in the area of vocational care; and then for five years, at the Auburn Council as a garbage collector. His physical health has always been quite good, according to the report. He was never the victim of any sexual abuse. He has never enjoyed a lasting sexual relationship, and his only sexual experience has been through masturbation. He denied that he was ever attracted to under-age girls, and denied fantasies with regard to young girls or boys. He does not use illegal drugs. He does not drink to excess, or gamble. He was first convicted of shoplifting at nineteen, and then in July 1999, of two counts of sexual intercourse with a person under ten. These are not his first offences.
When speaking to Mr Taylor, he continued to maintain his innocence, both with regard to the earlier two offences in 1999, and now. The doctor diagnosed an avoidant personality disorder, with some schizoid and self-defeating characteristics in his personality adjustment, ""The nature of his criminal offending behaviour also diagnoses him with paedophilia.""
Mr Taylor records that Ingham perceives himself as socially inept, inadequate and inferior. His internalised representations are composed of readily reactivated intense and conflict ridden memories of problematic earlier social relations. He has limited avenues for experiencing or recalling gratification, and few mechanisms to channel his needs, bind his impulses, resolve conflicts or defeat external factors. The results of testing did not show that he was experiencing ""significant symptoms of anxiety or depression"". There was no significant anger pathology. He is, it seems to me on the report, in all ways just an ordinary person, rather quiet, withdrawn and without problems, except this particular problem associated with these offences.
Ingham experiences, according to Mr Taylor, a considerable degree of social anxiety and distrust. He has quite strong needs for approval, acceptance and support. He is unable to establish appropriate relationships through which his needs can be met.
Mr Taylor concluded that the results of his examination indicated that Ingham has a moderate risk of recidivism. He presented as a person of about average intellectual ability. He had a close relationship with his mother and his stepfather, since his natural father died of cancer when he was less than a year old.""
18With respect to other considerations his Honour said: ""... It cannot be said that this offender is unlikely to reoffend. Mr Taylor identifies a moderate risk of recidivism. Since these are his second offences, and since he is unable to confront his problem, it seems to me that one cannot confidently say he is unlikely to reoffend.""
Muldrock error
19Following the decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39, (2011) 244 CLR 120 the appellant sought an enquiry into his sentence under s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).  The Attorney General conceded that referral under s 78(1) was warranted.
20On 19 December 2013 Latham J granted the application and referred the matter to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  Her Honour was satisfied that the sentencing judge's prescriptive approach to the imposition of the standard non-parole period where the offence under consideration was in or above the mid range was contrary to the principled approach identified by the High Court in Muldrock.  She was also satisfied that referral was warranted because the Court of Criminal Appeal, relying upon the decision in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, had rejected the ground of appeal against sentence that challenged the sentencing judge's approach to the standard non-parole period where the offence under consideration was in or above the mid range, the approach since disapproved of by the High Court. 
21The sole ground of appeal is in the following terms:""The sentencing judge erred in his consideration of the respective standard non-parole periods in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120.""
22The Crown conceded Muldrock error.  That being the case the question is whether, in undertaking the re-sentencing exercise for each of the ten offences the subject of a standard non-parole period, the imposition of a lesser sentence is warranted at law as provided for in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
23There was no challenge to the assessment of any of the offences relative to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, or any of the sentencing judge's related findings of fact bearing upon the nature and duration of the sexual assaults committed against each of the children.  As RA Hulme J observed in Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14, an assessment of objective seriousness referable to mid range offending does not run counter to Muldrock.  The question is whether in undertaking the re-sentencing exercise enlivened by a finding of Muldrock error, the imposition of a lesser sentence is warranted at law.  That exercise requires that all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles be taken into account to inform the positive opinion provided for in the section referable to the facts found by the sentencing judge that are unaffected by the Muldrock error (see Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284; see also RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236 at [98]; and ZZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 83 at [97]).
24The approach to sentence mandated in Muldrock requires a synthesis of all factors bearing upon an appropriate sentence for each of the ten counts on the indictment to which a standard non-parole period attaches, including the objective gravity of that offending and the impact of any aggravating factors; the appellant's subjective circumstances and the legislative guidance offered by the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole periods, without the latter being prescriptive or exerting undue influence in the determination of an appropriate sentence.  The standard non-parole period is not to be used as a starting point for a mid range offence after conviction; neither is it to have determinative significance (Muldrock at [31]).  It may, however, be a more significant factor where an offence is in the mid range (or above) of objective seriousness and where there is little operating in the offender's favour (see Filippou v R [2013] NSWCCA 92 at [116]; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195 at [63]).
25The extent to which there needs to be an order for partial accumulation of some or all of the individual sentences will also need to be considered to ensure the total effective sentence reflects the criminality across all offences. 
26In determining whether another sentence is warranted at law, consideration must be given to the evidence relied upon by the appellant as it relates to his custodial conditions since he was sentenced in October 2008 and his conduct as a prisoner since that time.  In R v Douar [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at [123] Johnson J considered the admissibility of evidence of this kind for the purposes of s 6(3) adopting the principled approach to that question in R v Burke [2002] NSWCCA 353 at [82]-[92].   
27The relevance of evidence of post-offence conduct in cases where a Muldrock error has been conceded or established will vary from case to case.  In Ali v R [2014] NSWCCA 45 the appellant accepted criminal responsibility and expressed remorse for the offending hitherto denied over many years, made efforts to obtain psychological help to provide insight to his offending, including completing eleven of fourteen sessions in the CUBIT preparatory program before he was advised by the Legal Aid Commission that his sentence was being reviewed following the High Court decision in Muldrock.  Taken together these factors led the Court to conclude that a lesser sentence was warranted in law.   In Grant v R [2014] NSWCCA 67 the appellant's deteriorating health whilst serving the sentence under review also attracted the intervention of the Court.
28The appellant relied upon an affidavit affirmed on 27 March 2014 in which he set out his custodial history including his current classification status as an A2 inmate at Goulburn Gaol where he has been a prisoner since May 2009.  
29He was on ""non-association protection"", at his own request, for a few months when first taken into custody in October 2006 after being assaulted in police cells by another prisoner who was aware of the fact that he had been charged with child sex offences.  Between 2007 and 2009 he was on ""limited association"" protection.
30On sentence in 2008 the sentencing judge was asked to take into account (it would appear in support of a finding of special circumstances) that the appellant would serve his sentence ""on protection"" and be denied work, educational courses and recreational opportunities.  His Honour declined to make that finding in the absence of any evidence that the appellant's custody would prove more onerous, observing that child sex offenders were, to his understanding, housed in ""special gaols"" and afforded access to ""courses and treatment"".
31Since May 2009 the appellant has been on what he described as ""normal protection"", having been assured of his safety within the Special Management Area Placement which is specifically designed for the management of offenders who are serving sentences for sexual offending involving children.  In a letter annexed to an affidavit sworn by the Crown's instructing solicitor and read by the Crown on the appeal, Mr Bolger, the General Manager of the Goulburn Correctional Centre, confirmed that the appellant will be managed under that arrangement for the duration of his sentence, having the same scheduled access to all programs and services as are shared among the various groups of inmates at Goulburn.  Mr Bolger also confirmed the appellant's evidence that he has not been the subject of any breaches of prison discipline since his incarceration and that he has been employed as a librarian at the Goulburn Correctional Centre since December 2012. 
32The appellant gave evidence that he has worked industriously and with initiative in this position.  He also expresses a willingness to undertake a therapeutic program for sex offenders and has spoken with staff about the Sex Offenders' Preparatory program and CUBIT which he has been given to understand will not be available to him until he is within the last few years of his non-parole period.  Mr Bolger confirms that the program is offered to offenders within two years of their earliest release date and that the appellant has been given a referral package to complete a preparatory course prior to CUBIT.  The appellant also indicates a willingness to participate in the ""Managing Emotions"" course which has been recommended to him. 
33In my view, despite the insights the appellant's evidence offers as to how his sentence has been served to date, neither evidence of his proven compliance with prison discipline nor the fact that he was on non-association protection for a relatively short period in 2006/2007, limited association protection for about two years, and thereafter ""normal protection"", justifies interference with the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge.  In addition, and despite the appellant's willingness to participate in programs specifically designed for the rehabilitation of sex offenders, what remains significant is that he does not express remorse nor accept responsibility for his past offending (the position he took on sentence), both factors which diminish the weight to be afforded any suggested improvement in his prospects of rehabilitation because of the programs offered in prison.  There was no evidence updating the appellant's risk of reoffending.  
34In my view, whether any lesser effective sentence is warranted will be dictated in this case by focusing on whether the sentences for all or any of the eight s 66A offences can be sustained.  Were the sentences imposed for those offences undisturbed, and were the orders for accumulation and concurrency across all offences maintained, any re-sentence on the remaining two s 61M(2) offences would have no effect on the appellant's effective non-parole period, the non-parole periods imposed for both offences having since expired.  On the other hand, if a lesser sentence is warranted for any or all of the eight s 66A offences, a restructuring of the commencement dates of all sentences (even in respect of the offences where the non-parole period has expired) is unavoidable. 
35The Crown submitted that despite Muldrock error, after appropriate consideration is given to both the maximum penalty of 25 years and the standard non-parole period of 15 years for each of the eight s 66A offences as legislative guideposts, and where the objective seriousness of each count is unmitigated by anything in the appellant's subjective circumstances or the evidence led on appeal, no lesser effective sentence would result. 
36The Crown also submitted that the appellant has the benefit of a considerable amelioration of the impact of the sentences imposed by a modest accumulation of 12 months.  The Crown submitted that given that the sexual offending involved multiple assaults of two young children over the course of a weekend, an order for partial accumulation of each of the individual sentences for the s 66A offences is the appropriate sentencing structure and not the very modest accumulation ordered by the sentencing judge.  The Crown submitted that even if some adjustment to the individual sentences might be warranted in recognition of the overly prescriptive approach of the sentencing judge to the standard non-parole periods, once the sentencing order is restructured, no lesser effective sentence will result.  
37I accept that even on re-sentence a lengthy effective sentence is inevitable in order to reflect the fact that, amongst other features of objective seriousness, CBS was apparently groomed over some months and where the assaults of both children were planned with JAW's birthday party sleepover affording him that opportunity.  Although the offending on the indictment extended over a period of days and not over weeks, months or years, it was not isolated and opportunistic offending (see Jones v R [2012] NSWCCA 262 at [96]).  It was also offending in violation of the children's legitimate expectation that CBS's home was a place of safety and refuge.  
38The length of the effective sentence must also reinforce the need for the criminal law to protect children from sexual exploitation and sexual violation and for appropriate recognition to be given to the standard non-parole period and maximum penalty the parliament has provided for sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years.  It is now well established that sexual offending against children has profound and deleterious effects for many years.  As this Court recognised in R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [110] the absolute prohibition on sexual activity with a child is intended to protect children from the physical and psychological harm they are subjected to when they are forced to engage in sexual activity. 
39As noted, there is nothing in the appellant's personal circumstances to mitigate the weight to be given on sentence to the objective seriousness of his offending.  He was not a person who was able to rely on good character given his criminal record for offending of the same kind as the offences for which he stood trial (cf RJA v R [2014] NSWCCA 89). 
40Both counsel referred to cases in this Court where sentences for multiple breaches of s 66A(1) have been the subject of review either by way of an application for leave to appeal sentence brought by an offender or a Crown appeal against inadequacy.  While there are some common features in each of the cases referred, no two cases are parallel and few are relevantly comparable.  The facts and circumstances of each case vary depending on the age of the child, the duration and extent of the sexual assaults, and the extent to which the conduct involves a breach of trust in addition to that which is inherent in the sexual abuse of a child under 10 by an adult.  The utility of drawing any conclusions as to an appropriate penalty range was further limited because many cases were decided when the principles in R v Way were the applicable law (see RJA v R [2008] NSWCCA 137; 185 A Crim R 178; and R v Smith [2011] NSWCCA 163 where many of the cases to that date were summarised by RS Hulme J).  It is also necessary that sentences imposed after the maximum penalty for s 66A was increased in 2009 are disregarded despite the fact that the standard non-parole period remained at 15 years.  
41I accept that there is no hierarchy of seriousness for a breach of s 66A(1) with penile penetration at the apex.  Other means and mechanisms by which the offence can be committed may, in a particular case, be equally if not more objectively serious.  I also accept, as was most recently restated in Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23 at [33]-[34] citing Doe v R [2013] NSW CCA 248 at [54] that there is no authority in this Court which supports the proposition that digital sexual intercourse is, of itself, less serious than other forms of forced sexual intercourse.  In Doe at [54] it was stated that:
""... Reference to the above authorities demonstrates that it has been emphasised, on more than one occasion, that the objective seriousness of offending is to be determined according to the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case in question. Concentrating upon, or giving primary significance to, the form of the forced sexual intercourse in determining its objective seriousness reflects an erroneous approach. It is equally erroneous to attempt to rank forms of forced sexual intercourse in some hierarchy so as to determine their objective seriousness.""
42Although both Simpson and Doe were concerned with sexual intercourse without consent involving adult victims, in Gavel, where breaches of s 66A were under review on a Crown appeal, Doe and Simpson were cited with equal application (at [97]).
43In this case, although I regard the two counts of penile penetration as objectively more serious than those involving fellatio, cunnilingus and digital penetration by reason of what appears to be more prolonged assaults, and where a condom was used and ejaculation occurred, were I not constrained by the findings of the sentencing judge that the offending constituted by those two counts was above mid range (a finding confirmed as free from manifest error on the previous appeal with the proviso that, on the sentencing judge's limited findings, replicated in [15] above, the offending exceeded mid range by a modest degree: see Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [119]), I would not have been persuaded that the two counts of penile penetration warranted a finding of objective seriousness above the mid range.  On the facts as they emerge from the sentencing reasons, I find little to distinguish between the five s 66A offences involving penetration of the vagina of either child in terms of the extent of penetration or the duration of the assaults.  That said, the sentences I propose for the two counts of penile penetration of both children (counts 5 and 9) will reflect the findings of the sentencing judge as will the sentences for the penetrative assaults the subject of counts 4, 7 and 12 (respectively the counts involving cunnilingus and fellatio committed against both children) and the assaults the subject of counts 2, 10 and 11 (respectively the counts involving digital penetration).  
44I also take into account that JAW was younger than CBS, having turned 8 on the weekend of the offending, CBS being aged 9 years and 3 months at that time, and that the offences are more serious, by a degree, for that reason (see R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172; 187 A Crim R 152 at [36]).  What is also significant is that each of the assaults constituted by each of the eleven counts was committed in the presence of both children by an offender with a previous criminal record for similar offending.  
45I am persuaded that despite the objective seriousness of the offending, unmitigated by anything in the appellant's subjective circumstances, a lesser sentence for each of the ten counts to which a standard non-parole period applies is warranted because of the determinative significance given to the standard non-parole period by the sentencing judge.  The one count (count 6) to which no standard non-parole period attaches has been adjusted to ensure relativity with the other sentences.  After an order for a partial accumulation of some of the sentences a lesser aggregate sentence will result.  
46I have made a limited finding of special circumstances in relation to counts 5 and 9, in consequence of the partial accumulation of some of the individual sentences.

(1)Allow the appeal.
(2)The sentences imposed in the District Court on 19 September 2008 are quashed.

2764310,R v Lamella [2014] NSWCCA 122,"Judgment

1PRICE J: The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (""the Director"") appeals against the sentences imposed upon Adrian Paul Lamella, (""the respondent""), in the District Court at Sydney by Sweeney DCJ on 6 February 2014. 

2The respondent pleaded guilty to two counts, the first being conspiracy to import the controlled precursor pseudoephedrine between about 1 January 2009 and about 31 December 2010 contrary to ss 11.5 and 307.11(1) Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years and/or 5000 penalty units. 

3The second count was an offence of being a Commonwealth public official, namely a Customs and Border Protection Officer, dishonestly agreeing to receive a benefit with the intention that it would influence the exercise of his duties as a Commonwealth public officer between about 1 January 2009 and about 31 December 2010 contrary to s 141.1(3) Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 10 years and/or 10000 penalty units. 

4The respondent asked the Judge to take into account on sentence pursuant to s 16BA Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) the following offences:

(i) Official abuse of Public Office to gain advantage contrary to s 142.2(1) Criminal Code (Cth); and 
(ii) Give corrupt benefit to a Commonwealth public official contrary to s 142.1(1) Criminal Code (Cth).

Each of these offences carries with it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. 

5Her Honour took these offences into account in the sentence imposed for the first count which was a sentence of 8 years imprisonment to date from 17 December 2012. 

6A sentence of 3 years imprisonment to date from 17 December 2012 was imposed for the second count. The Judge fixed a single non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment to date from 17 December 2012. The respondent will be eligible for release on parole on 16 December 2016. 

7The amended Notice of Appeal identifies the following grounds:

1. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to assess properly, or failing to give due weight to, the objective seriousness of the offences.

2. The learned sentencing judge failed properly to take into account, or failed to give due weight to, the two additional serious offences to which the Respondent admitted and requested be taken into account, pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) when imposing the sentence for Count 1. 

3. The learned sentencing judge erred by imposing sentences that failed to reflect properly or give due weight to the need for general deterrence. 

4. The learned sentencing judge erred in the application of sentence discounts for the Respondent's guilty plea and assistance to authorities by applying a single step combined discount of 50% which was applied to the notional head sentence, giving undue weight to those considerations, or otherwise resulting in sentences that were not of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offences. 

5. The learned sentencing judge erred by imposing a 50% non-parole period of 4 years as the minimum term required to be served, without regard or due regard to the matters in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 and all other circumstances, including the substantial discount already given for the guilty pleas and assistance. 

6. The sentences imposed are manifestly inadequate. 

Facts 

8At the time of the offences, the respondent was employed by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service as a Customs officer at Sydney Airport. His duties included screening and searching passengers from incoming flights for illicit and prohibited goods. Paul Katralis was also a Customs officer. A statement of agreed facts was tendered which the Judge recited in her remarks on sentence. Her Honour's remarks included the following (ROS 3-9): 

""There are three importations of cold and flu tablets which are involved in Mr Lamella's offence of conspiracy to import pseudoephedrine. The first occurred in June 2009 and involved two couriers named Kristal Hill and Manal Mizyed. These people became known to Mr Lamella in 2008. In early 2009 Mr Harb and Mr Lamella approached those two people in relation to importing cold and flu tablets from Thailand, for which they would be paid $10,000. At a meeting Mr Lamella told those two people of the method that would be used for the importation; that Mr Harb would travel to Thailand to purchase the tablets and would assist them in packing their bags, that he, Mr Lamella, worked at Customs and would ensure they passed through the airport without being searched; and he told them how they should dress and behave to avoid detection by investigating authorities at the airport.
In May 2009 Mr Lamella provided Joseph Harb with dates and flight details which coincided with the dates that he and his team would be working at the airport. Mr Lamella and Mr Harb subsequently met with the two couriers and Mr Lamella gave them details for them to book their flights. Mr Harb gave each of the other three people pre-purchased mobile phones which had been registered in false details, so that they could communicate with each other during the return flight from Thailand to Sydney Airport.

On 10 June 2009 Mr Joseph Harb flew to Thailand and purchased about 10 kilograms of cold and flu tablets from a pharmacy for about $6,000-$7,000. This comes from information provided by Mr Harb. On 13 June 2009 the two couriers, Mizyed and Hill flew to Thailand. On the date of their return flight to Australia Mr Harb went to their hotel and packed the cold and flu tablets into their suitcases among their luggage, dividing them roughly in half. Mr Harb then called Mr Lamella on the mobile phone he had given him for the purpose of the importation and Mr Lamella told Mr Harb that everything was good. Mr Harb in turn informed the couriers that everything was proceeding as planned. Mr Harb and Ms Hid and Ms Mizyed subsequently flew back from Thailand to Sydney.

When the two couriers arrived in Sydney they passed through the airport without being detected and they called Mr Harb to tell him that everything was 'okay'. Mr Harb came back after them and he met with the two couriers to collect the cold and flu tablets and told them he would pay them $10,000 each after he sold the tablets. After he collected the tablets Mr Harb sold them for about $200,000. He then provided Mr Lamella with approximately $5,000-10,000 to pay other Customs officers who had participated in the importation, and he divided the remaining $190,000 in half with Mr Lamella.

Mr Katralis told the police about the same importation, that towards the end of 2009 Mr Lamella approached him to assist with what he referred to as 'two chicks' coming through the airport with steroids from Thailand in their bags. He said that he agreed to assist Mr Lamella. He was working in the baggage hall and he had a high degree of discretion as to which passengers would be searched. Mr Lamella offered him $5,000 in cash and some human growth hormone as payment and there were communications between the two of them as a result of involvement in that importation. 

The second importation occurred in March 2010. It involved two couriers, Stephen Monaco and Alexander Riccio. According to Mr Halt's and Mr Katralis's information Mr Harb had a conversation with Mr Lamella in early 2010 about finding two more people who would be prepared to travel to Thailand and return to Australia with cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine. It was agreed Mr Harb would speak with a friend of his, Stephen Monaco, and Mr Lamella stated he would approach Mr Katralis about becoming involved. Mr Harb spoke to Mr Monaco. He agreed to travel to Thailand and was offered $10,000 to go to Thailand and return with the cold and flu tablets. Mr Monaco eventually could not find a woman to travel with him and he approached his friend Mr Riccio who agreed. Mr Harb told Mr Lamella that Mr Monaco had organised for Mr Riccio to travel to Thailand with him.

There was a meeting between Mr Harb, Mr Lamella, Mr Katralis, Mr Monaco and Mr Riccio in which they discussed how the importation would occur. The two couriers were told that Mr Lamella and Mr Katralis would ensure they got what is referred to as a 'free run' through the airport and would not be searched by officers there. Mr Lamella explained to the two couriers that they would be provided with blank incoming passenger cards that had been stamped with a green AQ'S stamp (and this is the subject of one of the charges on the s 16BA form). The purpose of that stamp was to indicate that the person travelling was not required to be searched by AQ'S, which is the quarantine service, and had nothing to declare. Mr Lamella told the couriers how they were to use their legitimate incoming passenger cards and their pre-stamped cards to avoid being searched on the return flight. That included that Mr Lamella would tell them by text message during their return flight of the letter being used by Customs officers on the day they were coming into the airport. That was so that the letter on their cards would match the letter that was being used by Customs officers and they would be allowed to pass through the airport without being inspected. Mr Katralis also explained how to pack the bags of the cold and flu tablets between layers of clothing to avoid the X ray machines. Mr Lamella told the couriers he would send them a text message indicating it was clear to proceed and if they did not receive that message they were to rip the name tags off the luggage containing the tablets and leave the suitcases on the luggage carousel. Mr Harb then gave Mr Monaco a phone, subscribed in a false name, and gave him the money to book the flights to Thailand for himself and Mr Riccio. Mr Harb also gave Mr Lamella a phone to communicate with Mr Monaco. Mr Harb then flew to Thailand.

On 4 March 2010 he attended a pharmacy and bought approximately 10 kilograms of cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine. On 8 March 2010 the two couriers left Australia and flew to Bangkok. Mr Harb took the tablets to the hotel room a few days later where the two couriers were staying in order to pack them into the bags they were to bring back. He told them that Mr Monaco should call from a pay phone prior to leaving Thailand to let him know they cleared Customs. On the return flight Mr Monaco turned on the phone he had been given by Mr Harb, he received a text message and told Mr Riccio to record on his passenger card a different flight number from the one they were travelling on. Mr Riccio did that but he decided at that point not to collect the suitcase containing the cold and flu tablets. When they arrived at the airport Mr Katralis has said that he and Mr Lamella agreed that Mr Katralis would put himself on what is called the 'green gate', which is the point where passengers with nothing to declare exit, and Mr Lamella would ensure that the two couriers were directed to that gate.

After arriving at the airport Mr Riccio disposed of his pre-stamped incoming passenger card which he had been given by Mr Lamella, by dropping it on the ground somewhere, and he presented his genuine passport and passenger card for stamping. He then told Mr Monaco, and Mr Lamella who was nearby, that he had lost his pre-stamped card. Mr Riccio did not collect the suitcase with cold and flu tablets from the baggage carousel and he walked away with only his carry on luggage. Mr Lamella then pretended to search Mr Riccio's carry on luggage and he discussed with him where he had lost his pre-stamped card. Mr Monaco collected both the suitcases with the cold and flu tablets, left by the 'green gate' and joined Mr Riccio in the arrivals hall. Subsequently Mr Riccio was not paid for his part in the importation because he had not collected his suitcase from the carousel.
Mr Harb sold the tablets for about $200,000. Mr Katralis received a payment from Mr Lamella of about $19,200. Mr Lamella himself received about $85,000, similar to the amount he received in respect of the first importation.

The third importation occurred on 17 June 2010. According to the information provided by Mr Harb and Mr Katralis, Mr Harb and Mr Lamella met in March or April 2010 and discussed a further importation with the person Sean Hutchinson and his girlfriend Ms Talbot as couriers. Hutchinson had met Mr Harb and Mr Lamella sometime during high school and they had socialised together since. Mr Harb met with Mr Hutchinson. Mr Katralis was contacted by Mr Lamella and he agreed to assist. Mr Hutchinson agreed to be involved and said he would talk to Ms Talbot and ultimately she was involved. She agreed to be involved because she had some financial difficulties and she was to be paid.

Mr Hutchinson and Ms Talbot then met with Mr Harb, Mr Katralis and Mr Lamella. Mr Katralis and Mr Lamella told them the flights they should use for the trip to ensure that they would be on shift at the airport when they came in with the importation. Mr Katralis told the couriers how to pack the bags with the pills concealed between layers of jeans to avoid the X ray machines. There was a discussion about Mr Lamella using a phone to inform Mr Hutchinson if all was good and if not he was to pull the tags off the bag on the baggage carousel, flush the tags down the toilet and leave the airport with only his carry on luggage. Mr Lamella, Mr Harb, Mr Hutchinson and Mr Katralis all met at Mr Harb's place to discuss the importation. Mr Hutchinson was told to conceal his tattoos as he looked too much like a bikie. Mr Katralis explained the smart gate procedures at the airport so that they could avoid Customs officers. Mr Lamella explained how Mr Hutchinson and Ms Talbot should use their pre-stamped passenger cards and the letter of the day that he would send them, to avoid them being selected for a search, and Mr Katralis and Mr Lamella discussed the airlines and flights that should be used for the trip. Ms Talbot and Mr Hutchinson then flew to Thailand as did Mr Harb.

Mr Harb purchased about 10 kilograms of cold and flu tablets from a pharmacy. He met Ms Talbot and Mr Hutchinson in Thailand, and took the tablets to their hotel room for them to pack into their luggage. He retuned on 15 June and on 17 June Ms Talbot and Mr Hutchinson came to Sydney Airport on a British Airways flight. Mr Katralis was positioned with Mr Lamella near a baggage carousel. He saw Mr Lamella speak with Mr Hutchinson on the carousel. He saw Mr Hutchinson and Ms Talbot pick up their bags from the carousel and walk towards the exit. Mr Harb then met them and took the tablets away from them. It is said that the tablets were stolen, there was difficulty in selling them and Mr Hutchinson receiving money, which meant that Mr Lamella received only $5,000 for his part in that importation. Mr Katralis was also paid and after some delay Ms Talbot was paid because of her financial difficulties.""


The respondent's case 

9The respondent did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence but a report from Phil Gorrell, a psychologist, was tendered together with a letter written by the respondent to the Judge and various character testimonials. 

10The respondent was born on 17 February 1984 and was 25 years old at the commencement of his offending. His prior criminal history disclosed that he had one offence of self-administration of a prohibited drug in June 2009 for which he was placed on a s 10 bond for 12 months. 

11The Judge noted that the respondent had joined the Customs Service when he was 22 years old and was regarded as having a bright future. Her Honour recounted that the respondent had been involved in drug use during the period of the offences and beforehand. He had used amphetamines from the age of 18, and between the ages of 23 and 25 he was using cocaine ""probably everyday"". The respondent was also using cannabis and amphetamines together with heavily abusing alcohol. Her Honour observed (ROS 12); 

""So no doubt those substances affected his judgement and caused him to divert from what was a positive Christian life to commit these offences."" 

12Her Honour referred to the reports from Pastor Gary Ring, the Regional Chaplain in Long Bay and Mr Gorrell, noting that ""Pastor Ring assesses [the respondent] as a committed Christian and says he is providing spiritual guidance to other inmates in prison and assesses him as truly remorseful and repentant, as does Mr Gorrell"" (ROS 12). 

13The Judge observed that the respondent had the love and support of his family and friends.

Some findings by the Judge 

14The Judge found that approximately 10 kilograms of cold and flu tablets were imported in each of the three importations conducted between June 2009 and June 2010. The amount of pure pseudoephedrine in the three importations was estimated at between 4.8 kilograms and 7.35 kilograms. Her Honour stated that ""an experienced chemist can convert one kilogram of pseudoephedrine into approximately 0.9 kilograms of methylamphetamine which is worth, wholesale, $250,000"" (ROS 10). Her Honour noted that there was no evidence the respondent ""knew about that ratio or yield"" but she took ""that into account as part of the potential harm from the importations"" (ROS 10). 

15The Judge found that the respondent took an ""active and equivalent role"" with Harb in the conspiracy although they played different roles in the importations. Her Honour observed that Harb sourced the pseudoephedrine and recruited the couriers whereas ""[the respondent's] role was to use his knowledge of Customs procedures at the airport to instruct the couriers how to subvert those procedures, and he subverted them himself in the way that he placed himself at the airport at the appropriate times to assist the couriers"" (ROS 10-11). 

16Her Honour noted that the respondent ""received a substantial financial reward for the first two importations, $85,000 in each case and was offered the same amount for the third but only received $5,000 because it was said that pseudoephedrine was stolen and could not be sold"" (ROS 11). Her Honour said that the respondent ""used and abused his position and knowledge as a Customs officer to commit the conspiracy offence and put the conspiracy into effect but the second charge...involves receiving a bribe which was the financial reward he received for performing his role in the conspiracy"" (ROS 11). Her Honour observed that the offences were intertwined to that extent. 

17The Judge found that both offences were serious offences of their type. 

18The Judge accepted that the respondent was genuinely remorseful and was unlikely to re-offend. 

19Her Honour said that the respondent's pleas of guilty in the Local Court indicated his willingness to facilitate the course of justice, that they were early pleas and indicated more than recognition of the inevitable. Her Honour found that the pleas warranted a discount of 25 per cent. 

20As to the respondent's assistance to the authorities, the Judge said that the assistance had been assessed by the Australian Federal Police ""as full and frank and of high value."" Her Honour concluded that the assistance was ""very considerable"" (ROS 13). Her Honour noted that because of the respondent's assistance and because of his former occupation as a Customs officer, he had been held in maximum security in the Special Purpose Centre in segregation and locked in regularly. The Judge said ""they are hard and restrictive conditions to serve a sentence in..."" (ROS 14) and he was likely to continue to serve his sentence in those conditions.

21The Judge considered whether the total discount for his pleas and assistance should be more than 50 per cent but concluded that although his assistance was very considerable and custodial conditions harsh and restrictive there were not ""very exceptional circumstances"" which permitted a total discount beyond 50 per cent. Her Honour assigned a 25 per cent discount to the respondent's pleas of guilty and a further 25 per cent for assistance divided equally between past and future assistance. The total discount was 50 per cent. 

22I turn now to the grounds of appeal. 

Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to assess 
properly, or failing to give due weight to, the objective seriousness of the offences. 

Argument 

23The Director submitted that in committing each of the offences, the respondent abused his position of trust as a Customs officer and as a law enforcement official. The Director pointed out that the respondent used confidential knowledge and information he had derived from his employment as a Customs officer at Sydney Airport to ensure the success of an organised, planned and sophisticated series of criminal acts committed over a significant period of time, pursuant to a shared criminal design he and others had implemented. The Director stated that the respondent's offending was objectively very serious and the Judge had failed to properly assess, or give proper weight to, the objective seriousness of the offences. 

24It was further submitted that the Judge's reasons and sentences imposed supported the conclusion that when assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, the Judge had not properly taken into account, or given proper weight to the gravamen of the conspiracy offence (count 1) and the aggravating circumstances of the bribery offence (count 2), when taken into account as an aspect of the overall conspiracy offence, especially when imposing wholly concurrent sentences.

25In oral address, the Director referred to the sentences imposed on Harb and Katralis and contended that her Honour's assessment of the respondent's offending ""vis-à-vis Harb and Katralis"" was not reflected in the sentence that she imposed. The Director argued by way of illustration that the Judge had found that the respondent was a more serious offender than Harb but had ultimately sentenced him to the same head sentence but with a lower non-parole period. This was said to demonstrate that the Judge had been mistaken even if she had used the sentences imposed upon the other offenders as ""yardsticks"". 

26The Director provided a schedule of the charges and sentences imposed upon the respondent, Harb and Katralis. It is important to note that Harb and Katralis were not charged with the same offences as the respondent. Harb was charged with three counts being:

(a) One count of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor, namely, 14.69 kilograms of pseudoephedrine between 10 August 2012 and 19 August 2012 contrary to s 307.11 Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years and/or 5000 penalty units. 

(b) One count of giving a bribe to a Commonwealth public official contrary to s 141.1(1) Criminal Code (Cth) between 1 June 2012 and 19 August 2012. The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment and/or 10000 penalty units.

(c) One count of deemed supply of a prohibited drug, namely pseudoephedrine, contrary to ss 25(1) and 29 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years imprisonment and/or 2000 penalty units.

27The Director referred to Harb being sentenced for one importation whereas the respondent's offending involved three importations. The total net weight of the pseudoephedrine in Harb's single importation was 14.379 kilograms with a pure weight of 3.186 kilograms. Harb was sentenced by Sorby DCJ on 31 May 2013. His Honour assessed a 50 per cent total discount on sentence. Harb was sentenced on the first count to 8 years imprisonment, on the second count to imprisonment for 3 years 6 months and 12 months on the third count. The sentences for counts 1 and 2 were imposed concurrently with the sentence for count 3 being partially accumulated. A single non-parole period of 5 years was set for the Federal offences. The total effective sentence was 8 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. 

28Katralis had been sentenced by Sorby DCJ on 26 April 2013. He was charged with one count of aid, abet, counsel or procure the importation of a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, between 1 June 2012 and 19 August 2012 contrary to ss 11.2 and 307.11 Criminal Code (Cth) and one count of receiving a bribe as a Commonwealth public official contrary to s 141.1(3) Criminal Code (Cth). An offence of abuse of a public office to cause detriment and gain advantage contrary to s 142.2(1) Criminal Code (Cth) was included on a 
s 16BA schedule. 

29The first count concerned the assistance provided by Katralis for Harb's single importation of pseudoephedrine with a total net weight of 14.379 kilograms. His Honour assessed a 50 per cent total discount for his plea of guilty and assistance to authorities. For the offence of aid and abet, Katralis was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years and for the bribery offence, 3 years imprisonment was imposed. Both sentences were ordered to be served concurrently with a single non-parole period of 4 years being set. The total effective sentence was 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. 

30The respondent contended that no aspects of the sentencing remarks were identified by the Director to show that the Judge failed to properly assess or to give proper weight to the objective seriousness of the offences. The respondent submitted that the Judge made it clear that the conspiracy was significant and the respondent had participated by abusing his position and knowledge as a Customs officer. 

31As to the sentences imposed on Harb and Katralis, the respondent argued that by failing to appeal the sentence imposed on Harb, in circumstances where his offending conduct was objectively serious, the Crown had accepted the range of sentences available for matters involving such criminal conduct. The respondent contended that allowing the Crown appeal would have the consequential disparity relative to the unchallenged sentence of Harb and any increase in the respondent's sentence would be relatively small and amount to ""tinkering"". Harb's conduct was said to be of a sufficiently serious and similar nature to warrant a degree of comparison which the respondent submitted was properly done by the Judge. 

Consideration 

32The first ground of appeal complains that the Judge failed to ""assess properly"" or failed to give ""due weight"" to the objective seriousness of the offences. This ground does not in its terms complain that the Judge failed to properly apply the principle of parity. This was acknowledged by the Director when he said in oral address that he was ""not running it as a parity argument so much"" but was looking at what her Honour found and those findings not being reflected in the sentence. 

33It is well established that a complaint that a judge failed to attribute sufficient weight to an issue on sentence will not generally be a material error. As Johnson J said in Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121 at [40]:

""The second, third and fourth grounds of appeal complain that the sentencing Judge had given ""insufficient weight"" to different aspects of the Applicant's subjective case in passing sentence. In Stephens v R [2009] NSWCCA 240, Grove J (McClellan CJ at CL and RA Hulme J agreeing) observed at [16]-[18], that there are inherent problems in a ground expressed in that fashion succeeding, as the ground tacitly concedes that some weight had been placed upon the factor by the sentencing Judge. Circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by this Court are narrowly confined, whether the proceeding is a Crown appeal or an offender's application for leave to appeal with respect to sentence: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Ryan v R [2009] NSWCCA 183 at [33]; Cao v R [2010] NSWCCA 109 at [57].""

34It cannot be doubted that these are serious offences. There were three importations of pseudoephedrine. The respondent used his specialised knowledge and position as a Customs officer to assist the couriers through Sydney Airport whilst they were in possession of the pseudoephedrine. His offending included providing instructions and information to Harb, Katralis and the couriers to ensure that the arrival of the couriers would coincide with shifts that he and Katralis would be working at the airport. He provided the couriers with information about the code of the day being used by Customs to mark incoming passenger cards and provided Harb and the couriers with pre-stamped incoming cards to enable the couriers to pass through Quarantine without inspection. The respondent had been paid $175,000.00.

35The Judge was plainly conscious of the objective seriousness of the offences which is reflected not only in her Honour's finding that they were serious offences of their type, but also in the undiscounted starting points of 16 years for the conspiracy offence (count 1) and 6 years for the bribery offence (count 2). 

36The Director's complaint that proper weight was not given to the gravamen of the conspiracy offence and the aggravating circumstances of the bribery offence, especially when concurrent sentences were imposed has, in my opinion, no substance. During the proceedings on sentence, the Crown submitted to the Judge that there was an overlap in the criminality involved in counts 1 and 2, and the abuse by the respondent of his position in return for financial reward was an aggravating feature of count 1. The Crown put to the Judge that taken into account in this way, the sentences to be imposed for counts 1 and 2 could be wholly concurrent. 

37In her sentencing remarks, the Judge found that the respondent used and abused his position and knowledge as a Customs officer to commit the conspiracy offence and the offences were intertwined. Her Honour noted that both the Crown and counsel for the respondent agreed that concurrent sentences should be imposed ""given the overlap of the conduct between the two offences"" and that was ""the appropriate course given the intertwining of the conduct which constitutes the elements of the two offences"" (ROS 15). 

38The undiscounted starting point of 16 years for the conspiracy offence (including the offences on the s 16BA schedule) does not support the Crown's contention that insufficient weight was given to this factor of aggravation by the imposition of concurrent sentences. 

39Submissions were made to the Judge on the question of parity with the sentences imposed on Harb and Katralis. These offenders had not been charged with the same offences as the respondent, but with the single importation of pseudoephedrine and bribery in 2012. This did not make the parity principle irrelevant but made the Judge's sentencing task more difficult: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49 at [30]; (2011) 244 CLR 462. Furthermore, it is evident that there were differences in the subjective circumstances of the offenders. 

40The Judge considered the issue of parity in her remarks on sentence which included her Honour noting that the respondent's offending ""involved three importations and this was more sustained than the one importation for which Mr Harb and Mr Katralis were sentenced"" (ROS 16). Her Honour observed that the respondent's financial reward was greater than that received by Katralis and his role in putting the conspiracy into effect was ""effectively equivalent to that of Harb in their joint enterprise which was put before me (which exceeds the offence for which Mr Harb was sentenced)"" (ROS 16). Her Honour observed that the respondent's role was greater than Katralis in the importation for which he was sentenced. Her Honour said that she had regard to the sentences imposed upon Harb and Katralis in deciding how to sentence the respondent. 

41The undiscounted starting point for Harb's sentence of 16 years for the single importation was the same as the undiscounted starting point of the respondent's sentence for the conspiracy offence. However, a matter of significant difference in their subjective cases was that the Judge accepted the respondent was genuinely remorseful and was unlikely to re-offend whereas Sorby DCJ, merely noted that Harb had expressed remorse to a psychiatrist, his family and friends. His Honour did not make a specific finding as to the degree of Harb's remorse or as to the unlikelihood of Harb's re-offending. The undiscounted starting point for Katralis' sentence for aiding and abetting the single importation (including the offence on the s 16BA schedule) was 14 years - two years less than the respondent's sentence for conspiracy. In my opinion, the undiscounted starting point of 16 years (including the offences on the s 16BA schedule) was within an appropriate exercise of the Judge's sentencing discretion although towards the lower end of an appropriate range. 

42I am not persuaded by the Director that the sentences imposed on the respondent when compared to the sentences imposed on Harb and Katralis demonstrate that the Judge failed to give due weight to the objective seriousness of the offences. 

43Consideration of the single non-parole period of 4 years will be deferred until Grounds 3 and 5. Ground 5 specifically raises this issue. 

44I would reject Ground 1 of the appeal. 

Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge failed properly to take into 
account, or failed to give due weight to, the two additional serious offences to which the Respondent admitted and requested be taken into account, pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) when imposing the sentence for Count 1. 
Argument 

45The Director stated that the two additional offences that were to be taken into account pursuant to s 16BA Crimes Act (Cth) concerned the conduct of the respondent in obtaining and providing the pre-stamped incoming passenger cards for the couriers and in making payments to Karalis (and other Customs officers) for their involvement in the importations. The Director contended that these offences were serious in their own right and the sentence imposed for the conspiracy offence indicated that the Judge did not properly give effect to the two offences listed on the s 16BA schedule. 

46The respondent submitted that these offences were properly taken into account by the Judge. It was pointed out that her Honour had noted specifically the respondent's conduct in relation to the blank incoming passenger cards and to corruptly involving Katralis. 



Consideration 

47Once again, the Director's complaint is that the Judge ""failed to give due weight"" to the offences on the s 16BA schedule and the observations made at [33] above are apposite to this ground. 

48Section 16BA Crimes Act (Cth) permits the court, with the consent of the prosecutor, to take into account other Federal offences to which an offender has pleaded guilty. There is, in my view, no reason to think that Spigelman CJ's approach in Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 to New South Wales offences included on a Form 1 does not apply to Federal offences included on a schedule. Spigelman CJ considered at [42] that offences included on a Form 1 are to be taken into account to increase the penalty otherwise appropriate by giving greater weight to the need for personal deterrence and the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences. 

49The Judge expressly referred to the respondent's conduct that constituted the two offences on the s 16BA schedule. Her Honour recognised that the offence, contrary to s 142.2(1) Criminal Code (Cth), involved the respondent affixing an official stamp to blank passenger cards to which she referred in her recitation of the facts and the offence contrary to s 142.1(1) Criminal Code (Cth) concerned the offer of payments to Katralis in the course of carrying out the conspiracy. As I have previously found, the undiscounted starting point of 16 years for the conspiracy offence, including the offences on the s 16BA schedule was within an appropriate exercise of her Honour's sentencing discretion. I am not persuaded that the Judge failed to give due weight to the offences on the s 16BA schedule. 

50I would reject Ground 2 of the appeal.

Ground 3: The learned sentencing judge erred by imposing sentences 
that failed to reflect properly or give due weight to the need for general deterrence. 

Ground 5: The learned sentencing judge erred by imposing a 50% non-
parole period of 4 years as the minimum term required to be served, without regard or due regard to the matters in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 and all other circumstances, including the substantial discount already given for the guilty pleas and assistance. 

51It is convenient to deal with Grounds 3 and 5 together. The observations made at [33] above apply to Ground 3. 

52The next complaint by the Director was that the ultimate sentence supported the conclusion that the Judge must have failed to give proper regard to the importance of general deterrence. The Director submitted that offences involving bribery or corruption of a Commonwealth public official, especially a law enforcement official, to facilitate the commission of such serious offences required the principle of general deterrence to be a paramount consideration in the exercise of the sentencing discretion in relation both to the conspiracy offence and the bribery offence. The Director argued that the non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment did not act as a sufficient deterrent to other like-minded offenders. 

53The Director observed that it was difficult to determine why a minimum term of 4 years had been fixed as the Judge had not provided reasons for that conclusion. It was submitted that it was open to conclude that the Judge had double counted the respondent's subjective matters in determining the notional starting point of the sentence in arriving at the discount for the guilty pleas and assistance, and in determining the minimum period to be served. Given the grave offending involved, the final result of 4 years non-parole was low enough to ""shock the public conscience"". 

54The respondent submitted that the undiscounted starting point of the sentence was 16 years and the focus should not be on the 4 year non-parole period as the actual sentence of imprisonment was 8 years which was a sufficient deterrent. 

55The respondent referred to her Honour's findings on remorse and contrition, his likely rehabilitation and hardship in custody. Further reference was made to the timing of the plea and the assessment of the respondent's assistance to be ""of high value"". The respondent submitted that when considering the submissions made to the Judge that the sentences imposed were to be served concurrently, no error was apparent from the sentence ultimately imposed. 

Consideration 

56Section 16A(1) Crimes Act (Cth) requires the court to ensure that the sentence ""is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"". In determining what will be an appropriate sentence, the court is obliged to take into account general deterrence: DPP (Cth) v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370. An appropriate sentence embodies both the head sentence and the non-parole period.

57In the present case, general deterrence is a matter of fundamental importance in determining an appropriate sentence. The maintenance of Australia's border security is dependent upon the integrity of Customs officers who are the sentinels of the system. A Customs officer is in a position of authority and trust. Customs officers in the position of the respondent are entrusted with specialised knowledge of the detection and clearance processes of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. The abuse by a Customs officer of the trust reposed in him by misusing his knowledge to facilitate the importation into Australia of border-controlled precursors and prohibited drugs is a very serious crime, as is the bribery of a Customs officer. These offences undermine the very core of our Nation's border protection and other Customs officers must be deterred from engaging in similar conduct. 

58The Judge was conscious that general deterrence was to be taken into account as she said (ROS 2): 

""In sentencing Mr Lamella I am required to take into account the matters in s 16A(2) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and general deterrence, which is important in sentencing for offences such as these, and impose a sentence of severity appropriate in all the circumstances.""

59In my opinion, the Judge did not fail to give due weight to the need for general deterrence when she fixed the undiscounted starting point of the conspiracy sentence. However, the non-parole period of 4 years is another matter. 

60When sentencing for a Federal offence, there is no 'norm' or usual ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period: Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [44]. In Hili, the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) considered the proper approach to the determination of the minimum term of a sentence imposed under the Crimes Act (Cth). Their Honours said at [40]-[41]:

""The Court of Appeal in Ruha examined what considerations bear upon fixing the length of a pre-release period under a recognizance release order. As the Court of Appeal rightly said, ss 16A(1) and (2) 'make it plain that all of the circumstances, including the matters in the non-inclusive list in s 16A(2), must be taken into account in making recognizance release orders just as they must be taken into account in imposing a sentence of imprisonment'. In determining what recognizance release order is to be made, s 16A(1) requires the sentencing court to 'make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence'. What is the 'severity appropriate' is determined having regard to the general principles identified by this Court in Power v The Queen, Deakin v The Queen and Bugmy v The Queen.

In the present cases, one consideration critical to the making of recognizance release orders was the determination of what was the period of imprisonment that justice required that each offender must serve in custody. And as the Queensland Court of Appeal pointed out in Ruha, again correctly, 'the necessary deterrent and punitive effects of sentences for serious tax fraud must be reflected both in the head sentence and also in any provision for earlier release from custody.'""


61In her sentencing remarks, the Judge did not provide reasons for the non-parole period being 50 per cent of the head sentence. 

62Her Honour was entitled to take into account the respondent's personal circumstances, including his prospects for rehabilitation in fixing the non-parole period. However, in my respectful opinion, her Honour overlooked the obligation to ensure that the minimum period of mandatory custody appropriately reflected the criminality involved in the respondent's offending and did not lose the important significant effect of general deterrence. 

63In my view, a non-parole period of 4 years neither appropriately reflects the seriousness of the respondent's offending, nor does it ensure that the respondent is being adequately punished for his offences and does not take into account the fundamental importance of general deterrence. 

64I propose to uphold Ground 3 (so far as it relates to the non-parole period) and Ground 5 of the appeal. 

Ground 4: The learned sentencing judge erred in the application of 
sentence discounts for the Respondent's guilty plea and assistance to authorities by applying a single step combined discount of 50% which was applied to the notional head sentence, giving undue weight to those considerations, or otherwise resulting in sentences that were not of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offences. 





Argument

65The Director noted that the Judge had applied a ""single step"" discount of 50 per cent. The Director submitted that the end result was wrong because the approach taken of a single step discount, which is not itself prohibited, was not applied with the degree of care required and the overall sentence was not reasonably proportional with the grave criminality involved. It was further contended that the notional starting point of 16 years imprisonment was too low to enable a combined discount of 50 per cent to be applied. 

66In oral address, the Director submitted that the end result of the sentence after the discount was grossly inadequate and an affront to community standards. 

67The respondent argued that the 16 year starting point was a clear recognition of the seriousness of the criminal conduct and the ratio of 50 per cent was not unduly disproportionate. 

Consideration 

68In written submissions before the Judge, counsel for the Crown stated that the respondent ""has provided very significant co-operation and assistance to law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the importation of 15 March 2010 and other offences"" (AB 109 par 36). The Crown submitted that ""the discount to be given for the [respondent's] assistance should be of a ""high order"", but, unless the contrary is shown, the circumstances are not so exceptional that the combined discount for the guilty plea and assistance would exceed the 50% discount ..."" (AB 109 par 38).

69In oral address, the Crown put to the Judge ""that it would be appropriate that your Honour give a combined discount if your Honour was minded to do. The Crown's submission is it wouldn't be one that would exceed 50%"" (AB 12).

70The Crown did not make a submission as to the method of calculation of the discount. It was not put to her Honour that a ""single step"" discount should not be applied. A statement of assistance was provided to the Judge which detailed the extent and value of the respondent's assistance to the law enforcement agencies. 

71The Judge was required to take into account ""the degree to which the [respondent] has shown contrition for the offence"": s 16A(2)(f) Crimes Act (Cth) and ""if the [respondent] has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence - that fact"": s 16A(2)(g). Her Honour considered that the pleas entered in the Local Court warranted a discount of 25 per cent. The Director did not submit to this Court that a discount of that order was not open to the Judge. 

72Section 16A(2)(h) obliged the Judge to take into account ""the degree to which [the respondent] has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences."" 

73The Judge was aware that a combined discount for a guilty plea and assistance should not normally exceed 50 per cent and a combined discount exceeding 50 per cent should be reserved for exceptional cases: SZ v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 249; [2007] NSWCCA 19; AAT v R [2011] NSWCCA 17. Her Honour gave careful consideration to the level of the respondent's assistance and concluded that it was very considerable. Her Honour recognised that because of that assistance and the respondent's former occupation as a Customs officer, he had been held in maximum security in the Special Purpose Centre and his custodial conditions were hard and restrictive. However, her Honour concluded that this was not an exceptional case justifying a discount beyond 50 per cent. Her Honour assessed a discount of 25 per cent for the respondent's assistance, which was divided equally between past and future assistance. 

74I do not detect any error in the Judge's approach to the combined discount. 

75The Director did not argue that a discount assessed at 25 per cent for assistance was not open to the Judge. The Director's principal complaint was that the end result was grossly inadequate and an affront to the community. 

76Having considered the application of a combined discount, a sentencing Judge is required to stand back and ask whether the resulting sentence is just and reasonable, not only to the offender but also to the community at large: SZ per Howie J at [5]. 

77I am not persuaded by the Crown that the respondent's resulting head sentence of 8 years imprisonment after application of the 50 per cent discount was not just and reasonable to the community at large. 

78The Director accepted that neither s 16A(2)(h) nor any other provision in the Crimes Act (Cth) mandated a two-stage approach to the application of a combined discount. No method or manner in which the discounting is to be achieved in Federal offences has been prescribed. In my view, as in sentencing for NSW offences, the approach to be taken to the application of a combined discount in Federal offences remains a matter of judicial discretion. 

79I would reject Ground 4 of the appeal. 

Ground 6: The sentences imposed are manifestly inadequate.

Argument 

80The Director contended that the sentences imposed clearly fell outside the range of permissible sentence that could reasonably have been imposed by a sentencing judge in all the circumstances of the offence and of the respondent. 

81The respondent argued that the Crown's obligation to prove that the sentence was not within the permissible range was undermined by the failure of the Crown to establish error in her Honour's reasoning or to prove that there is a range of sentences that show some degree of disparity with the respondent's sentence. It was further submitted that the ground of manifest inadequacy was undermined by the failure of the Crown to appeal Mr Harb's sentence on the basis of manifest inadequacy. 

Consideration 

82The head sentence of 8 years was within an appropriate exercise of the Judge's sentencing discretion although towards the lower end of an appropriate range. I have found, in my respectful opinion, that her Honour erred in fixing a non-parole period of 4 years. The non-parole period was manifestly inadequate. In all the circumstances, a non-parole period of 6 years was called for. 

83The question remains as to whether the Court should intervene and re-sentence the respondent. There is a residual discretion to decline to interfere even though the non-parole period is manifestly inadequate. 

84In Green, the majority (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) observed at [1] that the primary purpose of Crown appeals was to ""lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons."" Their Honours at [36] described the primary purpose of laying down principles as a ""limiting purpose"" and said:

""It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion."" 

85Their Honours observed at [43] that other circumstances may combine to produce injustice if a Crown Appeal is allowed. Their Honour's said at [43]: 

""They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of the re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation. They are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. The guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual.""

86In an affidavit sworn 1 June 2014, the respondent refers to the great deal of stress and anxiety that he has suffered since being advised that the Director was considering an appeal. Nevertheless, the respondent has continued to provide assistance to the Australian Federal Police pursuant to his undertaking that has included attending the Australian Federal Police headquarters on a number of occasions to prepare a further statement and giving evidence in committal proceedings. He remains committed to giving evidence even though it will increase his levels of stress and anxiety. The respondent is currently held in the Special Purpose Centre at the Long Bay Correctional Centre. 

87In a report dated 30 May 2014 (annex A to the affidavit of Stephen Tully), Mr Gorrell refers to the impact that the appeal has had on the respondent. Mr Gorrell recounts that when sentenced by the Judge, the respondent ""recognised his life's errors and accepted that punishment was required"" (annex A p 6). The respondent was going to make his time in custody a positive experience and was keen to assist the police. When Mr Gorrell assessed the respondent on 30 April 2014 he was suffering depression and anxiety. Mr Gorrell opines that the respondent is not coping and is in need of psychiatric treatment. Mr Gorrell states (annex A p 6):

""The precipitant to Mr Lamella's current state of mental health relates to the stress of his sentence being appealed; the fact that he is located in a maximum security gaol with the restrictions thereof when he knows that he could be, due to his classification, in a far more comfortable minimum security gaol; and due to his concern that the police are betraying him whilst saying all will be okay."" 

88The material before the Judge referred to the positive steps that the respondent was taking towards rehabilitation. The Judge accepted that he was genuinely remorseful and was unlikely to re-offend. The continuation of his assistance to the authorities, notwithstanding the Director's appeal, supports a finding of substantial progress towards rehabilitation. His mental health has deteriorated as a consequence of the appeal. 

89In my view, the Court should exercise its residual discretion not to intervene. Accordingly, I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

		10 July 2014",2014-07-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764318,Carey v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (ACN 008 438 828) (No. 2) [2014] NSWDC 93,"Judgment

1On 20 June 2014 I handed down judgment in Carey v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (ACN 008 438 828) [2014] NSWDC 73, granting the plaintiff leave to replead imputations (c), (d) and (e).

2The plaintiff did not file an amended pleading in accordance with my orders, preferring to advise the defendant by letter that he proposed to plead the following imputation:

""The plaintiff is racially inferior.""

3The proceedings were listed before me today for argument concerning the form and capacity of this imputation. Conformably with my obligations to give reasons for striking out this imputation with leave to replead (Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 6), I set out my reasons for the orders made today.

4As to capacity and defamatory meaning, the defendants formally challenge this imputation firstly on the same basis as that set out at [4] - [17] of my judgment of 20 June 2014. I shall not repeat my earlier rulings, beyond noting that, in addition to the other authorities to which I was referred, I have found an additional judgment referring to Zbyszko v New York American Inc (1930) 239 NYS 411, where the court held it was disparaging of the plaintiff to compare him to a gorilla. In Boyd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 449, Hunt J cited this decision as authoritative when explaining the manner in which an imputation may be defamatory if it is disparaging of the plaintiff:

""[11] To be defamatory of the plaintiff, the imputation relied upon must be such as is likely to cause ordinary decent folk in the community, taken in general, to think the less of him: Gardiner v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd; Consolidated Trust Co Ltd v Browne. At common law, in general, an imputation, to be defamatory of the plaintiff, must be disparaging of him. ...I say that this is ""in general"" the position, as the common law also recognizes as defamatory an imputation which, although not disparaging, tends to make other persons ""shun or avoid"" the plaintiff, for example, by attributing to him that he is insane: Morgan v Lingen; or by attributing to her that she has been raped: Youssoupoff v Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Ltd, as well as an imputation that displays the plaintiff in a ridiculous light, notwithstanding the absence of any moral blame on his part: Cook v Ward; Dunlop Rubber Co Ltd v Dunlop; Burton v Crowell Pub Co. See also Zbyszko v New YorkAmerican Inc.""

5In addition, when determining whether the ordinary reasonable reader would consider such an imputation defamatory, I note the analysis of pleading imputations of racial inferiority by Lawrence McNamara in ""Reputation and Defamation"", Oxford University Press, 2007, pp 193-197. 

6I accordingly reject the defendants' submissions that an imputation of racial inferiority is incapable of being defamatory and that, if it is defamatory, the bane outweighs the antidote.

7The second basis of the defendants' argument arises from the form of the imputation. What is meant by the imputation that the plaintiff is ""racially inferior""? Does this mean that he is racially inferior to white persons, or that he is inferior to other persons in the sense of being sub-human? 

8The defendants submit that the nature of the racial inferiority (whether on the basis that he is Aboriginal and not white, or inferior to all other human beings regardless of race) should be stated in the imputation. If the meaning is that he is sub-human or like an animal (such as an ape), that may not differ in substance from the other imputations already pleaded. 

9Mr Rollinson, for the plaintiff, submitted that the imputation, or one like it, was clearly conveyed. The issue, however, is one of the form of the imputation. If the imputation is that the plaintiff is racially inferior to other human beings because of his appearance, that imputation must differ in substance from imputations (a) and (b). If it is asserted to be due to his Aboriginal heritage, this should be made clear. 

10For the reasons explained by the Court of Appeal in Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 49 at [31] and [41] - [43], the imputation in its current form is too imprecise, and should be struck out with leave to replead. 

11The plaintiff should pay the defendants' costs. The objections taken by the defendants to the form of the imputation were clearly set out in their correspondence, and the plaintiff should have considered redrafting the imputation to cure the defects of form. 

The relisting of this matter

12After I handed down judgment on 20 June, the plaintiff's solicitors wrote to the registry seeking to relist the matter on 27 June, but without consulting the defendants' solicitors, inquiring as to their availability or sending them copies of correspondence. 

13The solicitors for the defendants replied on 24 June complaining about this failure, and referring to statements to this effect in Stanizzo v Badarne & Ors [2014] NSWSC 689 at [63]-[80]. 

14Given the number of defamation proceedings in both the Supreme and District Courts in which the solicitors for the defendants (and their counsel) appear, it is important they should be given adequate notice of relisting. However, the same courtesy should be afforded for opposing counsel and solicitors generally.

15While the relisting of these proceedings without notice was no doubt an unfortunate oversight by the plaintiff's solicitors, parties in defamation proceedings will need to exercise additional care when relisting defamation matters for directions or arguments in future, as the Supreme Court will soon change its listing arrangements and conduct its defamation list on the same day as the District Court's defamation list. Practitioners will need to be more than usually accommodating to each other in the future. That will include not listing matters in future without prior consultation, rather than taking it for granted that a defendant's legal representatives are likely to be attending the defamation list because of other matters. 

16The costs order I have made against the plaintiff in relation to this argument should accordingly include the costs of the 27 June 2014 relisting.

Orders

(1)Proposed imputation ""the plaintiff is racially inferior"" struck out as embarrassing in form.

(2)Plaintiff is to file a further statement of claim pleading all imputations asserted to be conveyed.

(3)No further correspondence is to be sent to the court in these proceedings without correspondence being provided to the opposing party.

(4)Plaintiff pay the defendants' costs of the argument.

(5)Matter stood over to the Defamation List on Friday 25 July 2014 at 9:30am.

2764334,McKittrick v R [2014] NSWCCA 128,"Judgment
1SIMPSON J:  I have read in draft the judgment of Davies J.  His Honour's comprehensive statement of relevant facts and circumstances enables me to be brief in that respect.  I agree with Davies J that grounds 1 to 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 ought to be rejected.  In respect of grounds 4 and 5 I take a different approach.  I am also of the view, notwithstanding that the Applicant has not made good her challenge to the structure of the sentences (grounds 1 to 3), that, nevertheless, there should be some adjustment of the structure of the sentences, for reasons to which I will come.
2The relevant objective facts are as follows.  In May 2003, in the Coffs Harbour district, the Applicant embarked on a criminal enterprise by which victims were defrauded of approximately $6 million.  The criminal enterprise involved the applicant dishonestly persuading ""investors"" to entrust large sums of money to her for purported investment at high rates of return.  No such investments were ever made; the applicant, from time to time, made payments to the ""investors"", but, far from being sourced from successful investment, these payments came from other unwary victims.  Such enterprises are commonly referred to as ""Ponzi schemes"".  
3In April 2007 the Applicant broadened her activity and embarked upon an identical enterprise in the Newcastle/Hunter Valley area.  At that time she was under investigation in Coffs Harbour.  It is not clear whether she was aware of that investigation.  In September 2007 she was arrested and charged in relation to the Coffs Harbour offences.  She pleaded guilty to 15 charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception, and asked, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) that a further 19 offences listed on a Form 1 be taken into account on sentence.  One offence involved the defrauding of the victims of the sum of $97,000; all others involved frauds of over $100,000, going as high as $300,000, $450,000 and $640,000.  
4The Applicant was granted bail.  She ceased the Coffs Harbour operation, but, while on bail, continued the Newcastle/Hunter Valley operation, and did so until December 2008.  
5In May 2009 the Applicant was sentenced by Goldring DCJ in respect of the Coffs Harbour offences to a total term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.  The non-parole period was to expire on 27 May 2012.  The Applicant lodged an application for leave to appeal against the sentences.
6In August 2009 she was interviewed, from prison, in relation to the Newcastle/Hunter Valley enterprise.  No record of that interview is before this Court.  It is not known whether she then made admissions or not.  In any event, that interview did not initially result in the laying of any charges.
7In March 2010, counsel who represented the Applicant began pressing investigating police, by telephone and email, to advise what course they proposed to take with respect to the Newcastle/Hunter Valley operation.  On 29 March 2010 he was advised that police were in possession of sufficient information to proceed with charges, which they would ""endeavour"" to bring by the end of April of that year.  Counsel continued, from time to time, to seek information, and to note that no Court Attendance Notices had been served.  He alluded to the possibility of an application for a stay of any proceedings, on the basis of the delay, and consequent oppression.  Nevertheless, it was not until December 2011, just five months before the expiration of the Applicant's non-parole period, that Court Attendance Notices were issued.  The only explanation that appears from the materials available to this Court was that one of the officers (possibly the officer in charge) was on an extended period of sick leave, and that the Local Command was suffering from shortage of resources.  
8On 10 December 2010, after having her attention drawn to the power of this Court to increase the sentences imposed (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6), the Applicant withdrew her application for leave to appeal against the Coffs Harbour sentences.
9The Applicant first appeared before the Local Court in Newcastle in respect of the Newcastle/Hunter Valley Court Attendance Notices in February 2012, when she entered pleas of guilty for four counts of obtaining a financial benefit by deception.  She asked that another 10 such offences on a Form 1 be taken into account.  Thereafter, normal processes appear to have been followed.  Sentence proceedings in the District Court commenced on 19 July 2012, before Maiden DCJ, when the Applicant adhered to the pleas of guilty earlier entered.  She gave evidence, as did her husband, John McKittrick. 
10A substantial amount of material was before the sentencing judge, including material relevant to the Coffs Harbour offences.  Also placed before Maiden DCJ, on behalf of the Applicant, was a body of material indicating that the Applicant had taken steps to be declared bankrupt, and that that had happened.
11For a total of 14 offences involving defalcations exceeding $1,000,000 Maiden DCJ sentenced the Applicant to terms of imprisonment totalling 6 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years.  That sentence was fixed to commence at the expiration of the Coffs Harbour sentences and was therefore fully accumulated on the sentences imposed by Goldring DCJ.  That resulted in a total sentence (taking into account the Coffs Harbour sentence) of 9 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 8 years.
12Against that background, I consider the Grounds numbered 4 (delay) and 5 (totality).  I will also say something about Ground 9 (objective seriousness).  
Ground 4: delay
13I begin by observing that the delay in charging the Applicant with the Newcastle/Hunter Valley offences following the August 2009 interview, and the correspondence in March 2010 indicating that police were then in possession of sufficient information to bring charges, was entirely unacceptable.  There is no evidence that the Applicant contributed in any way to the delay; indeed, on her behalf, representations were made, on at least two occasions, for a decision to be made as to whether she was to be charged, and, if so, that that be done expeditiously.  The correspondence indicates that the Applicant was (or her legal advisers were) concerned to have all matters dealt with by the time the application for leave to appeal against the Coffs Harbour sentences came to a hearing.
14That delay is a relevant sentencing consideration is well established: R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517; Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59.  
15Todd and Mill are not entirely apposite.  In each case the offender committed offences in close proximity of time, but in different states, as a result of which they were incarcerated, for lengthy periods, in one state, before returning to the other state for the offences there committed to be dealt with.  In each case, it was held that the task of the second sentencing judge was to attempt to replicate the sentences that could be expected to have been imposed if all sentences had been imposed in a single sentencing exercise.  In Mill the following was said:
""In our opinion, the proper approach which his Honour should have taken was to ask what would be likely to have been the effective head sentence imposed if the applicant had committed all three offences of armed robbery in one jurisdiction and had been sentenced at one time.  It is most unlikely that the applicant would have been sentenced to eight years on the first count, eight years with six years of it concurrent on the second count, and eight years cumulative on the third count, making an aggregate head sentence of 18 years.  Yet that, it seems to us, is the practical effect of the sentence imposed by his Honour ... Without statutory authority, the only course open to the second sentencing court is to adopt a lower head sentence that reflects the long deferment that has taken place during which the offender has been in custody.  It is true that the lower head sentence will fail to reflect adequately the seriousness of the crime in respect of which it is imposed.  That is unfortunate.  However, it is to be preferred to the injustice involved in the imposition of a longer head sentence because of the inadequacy of the law to cope satisfactorily with the intervention of State boundaries."" 
As I have suggested, the circumstances are in no way comparable. 
16However, it has been recognised that delays of a lesser extent, and even where all offences are committed in this state, may also be a relevant sentencing consideration.  In R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121; 106 A Crim R 303, Wood CJ at CL, with whom Bell J and Smart AJ agreed, explained why that is so.  He said:
""16  The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach ..."" (internal citations omitted)
The first and second of these considerations are of some application in the present instance.  I do not accept that the Newcastle/Hunter Valley offences, delayed though the charges were, amount to ""stale crimes"".
17It does not follow, however, that in every case where delay has occurred in the prosecution of an offender, that circumstance necessarily results in a reduced sentence.  In R v V (1998) 99 A Crim R 297, Wood J (as he then was), with whom Gleeson CJ and Barr J agreed, said, after referring to Todd:
""It is this principle that the applicant seeks to call in aid.  However, it is clear from subsequent decisions of this court that Todd has not been viewed as authority for the proposition that wherever there is a stale offence or substantial delay leniency should necessarily be extended ...
As was pointed out in Thompson [Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 June 1996, unreported] each case depends on its own circumstances."" (some internal citations omitted] 
18It is true that Maiden DCJ did not expressly undertake an exercise of the kind mentioned in Mill.  However, the real question is whether this failure to do so resulted in any injustice to the Applicant.  In my opinion, it did not.
19The Applicant's offences could, on one view, be seen as a single continuing episode of criminality.  However, so to approach her offending would not reveal the whole picture.  The offences fall logically into two groups, not only because of the disparate geographical locations in which they were committed, but also by their timing.  They overlapped for only a relatively short period.  These circumstances mean that the offences could equally be seen as two consecutive episodes of similar criminality.
20The second important circumstance that marks a barrier between the two sets of offences is that (except for the earliest of the offences) the Newcastle/Hunter Valley offences were committed while the Applicant was on bail for the Coffs Harbour offences.  The flagrancy of her conduct ought not to be underestimated.  
21In my opinion, if Maiden DCJ had undertaken the Todd/Mill exercise, it would have been entirely open to him to impose wholly cumulative sentences.  Moreover, anything other than a modest degree of concurrency would not have properly recognised the criminality involved in the two separate series of offences, and particularly the seriously aggravating feature that the Newcastle/Hunter Valley offences were committed while the Applicant was on bail in respect of identical offences. 
22Accordingly, while I accept that the Remarks on Sentence do not clearly disclose that Maiden DCJ moderated the sentences by reason of the delay, I am of the opinion that he was not obliged to do so.  Further, I do not share the view of Davies J that these sentences could not be regarded as ""lenient"".  I would reject this ground of appeal.  
Ground 5: totality
23Central to the argument concerning totality was the effect of the accumulation of the sentences imposed in respect of the Newcastle/Hunter Valley offences on the Coffs Harbour sentences, producing a total sentence of 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 8 years.  
24Maiden DCJ was obliged to identify sentences appropriate to the offending, and any mitigating circumstances, in respect of each of the four counts before him, and taking into account the additional offences: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610.  It was then necessary to consider questions of accumulation or concurrency and of totality.
25Totality has two aspects.  It encompasses, first, the totality of the offending and, secondly, the totality of the sentences under consideration.  It is in respect of the latter that questions of accumulation and concurrence have significance.
26Maiden DCJ's first task was to assess the totality of the offending involved in the 14 offences before him (that is, including the offences listed on the Form 1).  These were committed over a sustained period of a little over 2 years (April 2007 to May 2009), the majority committed while the Applicant had the benefit of a grant of bail.  They involved 14 victims (counting couples as a single victim) defrauded, in many cases, of their life savings.  A total sentence of 6 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years was not, in my opinion, excessive, and not one that I would regard as severe.
27The totality question then involves the accumulation on the Coffs Harbour sentences.  That produced a head sentence of 9 years and 6 months.  That is, again, not a sentence that I would consider severe.  Encompassed within it are sentences for 48 offences, committed over a 6 year period, involving large amounts of money.  The offending was carefully planned and implemented.  There was no basis for it other than the Applicant's greed.
28In my opinion, the question of totality was not overlooked in relation to the head sentence.  Nor do I consider that a non-parole period of 8 years indicates that totality was overlooked.  I have, however, for other reasons, come to the view that an adjustment ought to be made to the non-parole period.  That is not for reasons of totality.
Ground 9: objective seriousness
29In respect of objective seriousness, the first complaint made concerns a passing reference in the Remarks on Sentence to ""an amount of $13,677,437"" that had ""passed through"" various accounts of which the Applicant had control or in which she had an interest.  
30This strikes me as somewhat paradoxical, given the complaint about the asserted failure of his Honour to give adequate weight to the issue of totality.  As set out above, the principle of totality calls for recognition of the totality of the offending, as well as of the sentences imposed.  That the Applicant had dealt with sums of money in the amount mentioned was relevant to that assessment.  
31In any event, I agree with Davies J that the brief reference to that amount did not bear upon the sentences imposed.  The reference was made in respect of two Commonwealth offences for which the Applicant was sentenced in the Local Court to terms of imprisonment that were fully concurrent with the Coffs Harbour sentences.
32I am unable to agree with Davies J that the sentences imposed by Maiden DCJ were ""severe"" (see [142]).  The amounts of money involved in the Newcastle/Hunter Valley offences were very large.  Individual ""investors"" lost large sums of money - in one case just under $336,000, in another $312,000, and yet another $336,000.  Others lost smaller, but nevertheless significant sums.  Maiden DCJ took the view, correctly in my opinion, that these were offences of very high criminality.  In respect of the other complaints made under this ground, I agree with Davies J.
33I would reject this ground of appeal.
Grounds 1-3: the non-parole period
34The complaint under these grounds is directed to the sentences, in aggregate, imposed by Maiden DCJ.  The overall non-parole period is a little under 77 per cent of the total sentence.  The non-parole period in respect of the third offence is 80 per cent of the total sentence imposed in respect of that offence.  
35Section 44(1) and (2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provide as follows: 
""44  Court to set non-parole period(1)  Unless imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, when sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).(2)  The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).""
36This has come to be called the ""statutory ratio"", which is not to be departed from unless special circumstances are found.  The effect of s 44(2) is that a sentence in accordance with ""the statutory ratio"" will be made up of a non-parole period that is 75 per cent of the head sentence.  Where the court decides to impose a non-parole period in a lesser proportion, it is required to state its reasons for doing so.
37There is no equivalent requirement for reasons where the non-parole period exceeds 75 per cent of the head sentence.  Nevertheless, it is usually considered appropriate that reasons be given for such a decision.
38Here, however, the increase was of less than 2 per cent.  As Davies J has shown, the sentences achieved what Maiden DCJ intended.  
39There is no significance in the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence in relation to the third offence.  When courts sentence sequentially for multiple offences, with some accumulation, it is common to depart from the statutory ratio in relation to individual offences.  Sometimes this is done for the express reason of restoring that ratio in relation to the overall sentence.
40The ""statutory ratio"" was first introduced into sentencing legislation in the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW).  That Act was intended to, and did, effect significant changes in sentencing procedures in NSW.  In introducing the Sentencing Bill to the Legislative Assembly, the Minister for Corrective Services, Mr Yabsley, said:
""We have turned the sentencing process on its head, and in doing so we have produced a sentencing regime that everyone will be able to understand."" (New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 10 May 1989 at 7905)
41Mr Yabsley went on to outline the major reforms contained in the Bill, and said:
""At present, the starting point for a court in sentencing a convicted person is the head sentence.  Having set the head sentence, which is intended to reflect the gravity of the offence committed, the court turns its attention to the particular circumstances of the case before it.  The court then sets a non-parole period.  In many cases, the non-parole period is substantially less than the head sentence.  The present sentencing system perhaps could be said to be based on a 'top down' approach.  Part 2 of the bill contains a sentencing scheme which is quite different.  Instead of working from the top down, the court will, under the new sentencing scheme, build its sentence from the bottom up.  
I shall explain how the 'bottom-up' approach will operate.  The court will begin by focusing on the question of how much time a person must spend in prison.  The court's answer to this question will become the minimum term of imprisonment.  The court will then turn its mind to the period that it thinks the prisoner should serve on parole.  This period - to be called the additional term - will then be added to the minimum term of imprisonment.
In accordance with the bill, the court will need to set the additional term so that it equals one-third of the minimum term of imprisonment, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances ... 
... The new sentencing scheme will give effect to the Government's undertaking that the non-parole period should be 75 per cent of the head sentence, to use the old terminology ..."" (italics added)
42Nowhere in the speech was any explanation given for the selection of 75 per cent as the proportion of the overall sentence required to be served in custody (other than to meet an election promise).  What is plain is that the intention was that the proportion should apply, in cases of multiple offending, to the overall sentence, that is, the total of the sentences imposed.  The structure of individual sentences is, at most, a secondary consideration.
43I have gone into this rather lengthy exposition for the following reasons.  Although, as I have said, I see no error in the proportions of the overall sentence imposed by Maiden DCJ (the increase on 75 per cent being minimal), in my opinion, it has been overlooked (and not a ground of appeal) that, when the sentences imposed by Maiden DCJ are added to the Coffs Harbour sentences imposed by Goldring DCJ, the proportion of the non-parole period to the head sentence is 84 per cent.  That, in my opinion, does not conform with sentencing principle.
44I would not, for myself, as is apparent from what I have said above, reduce the sentences by reason of error in the consideration of delay, totality, or objective seriousness.  I am troubled, however, by the resultant disproportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence.  I have considered the sentences proposed by Davies J.  On the sentences proposed by his Honour, when added to the Coffs Harbour sentences, the non-parole period is 63 per cent of the overall sentence.    
45In my opinion, the sentences should be structured so as to restore, on the overall sentence to be served by the Applicant (including the Coffs Harbour sentences) the statutory ratio.  That is, the overall non-parole period should approximate 75 per cent of the overall head sentence.  I would not interfere with the total sentence of 9 years and 6 months.  A non-parole period is the statutory ratio is a little over 7 years.  I would structure the sentences to produce a non-parole period of 7 years.  That can be achieved in the following way.
46I would not interfere with the sentences imposed by Maiden DCJ other than that in respect of sequence 4.  I propose that that sentence be varied only by specifying a non-parole period of 1 year, expiring on 26 May 2016.  Against a head sentence of 3 years and 6 months, standing alone, that appears to be disproportionate.  However, the effect is to bring the whole of the sentences, including the Coffs Harbour sentences, into line with s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
47The orders I would make are:
(1)Grant leave to appeal;
(2)Allow the appeal in part;
(3)Quash the sentence imposed by Maiden DCJ in respect of sequence 4;
(4)In lieu thereof, in respect of that offence, the Applicant be sentenced to imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 1 year, commencing on 27 May 2015 and expiring on 26 May 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months, expiring on 26 November 2018.
48DAVIES J: On 9 May 2012 in the Local Court the Applicant pleaded guilty to four counts of obtain a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 178BA Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  She also asked that ten other offences contrary to the same section of the Act be taken into account.  
49The maximum penalty for each of the offences charged was imprisonment for five years.  
50On 25 July 2012 she was sentenced by Judge Maiden in the District Court at Newcastle as follows:
Sequence 1: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months from 27 May 2012 expiring 26 May 2013;Sequence 7: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing 27 May 2012 and expiring 26 May 2014;
Sequence 3: (Taking into account three matters on the Form 1)  Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years to commence 27 May 2012 and expiring 26 May 2015 with the balance of term of nine months expiring 26 February 2016.
Sequence 4: (Taking into account seven matters on the Form 1) Imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years to commence 27 May 2015 and expiring 26 May 2017 with the balance of term of 18 months to expire on 26 November 2018.
51The effective sentence was a non-parole period of five years from 27 May 2012 to 26 May 2017 with the balance of term of 18 months to expire on 26 November 2018.
52The Applicant appeals on nine grounds as follows:
1. His Honour failed to make a finding of special circumstances;
2. His Honour erred in imposing an overall minimum non-parole period in excess of 75% of the total sentence;
3. His Honour erred in imposing a non-parole period in excess of 75% of the head sentence in relation to Count 3;
4. His Honour erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the delay in charging the Appellant;
5. His Honour erred in failing to give adequate weight to the issue of totality;
6. His Honour failed to give adequate weight to the Appellant's contrition and remorse;
7. His Honour failed to give adequate weight to the Appellant's medical condition;
8. His Honour erred in placing undue weight on the issue of General Deterrence in light of the Appellant's age, psychological state and medical condition.
9. His Honour erred in assessing the objective seriousness of the individual offences:
(a) His Honour erred in taking into account that an amount of $13,677,437 was supposedly passed through various accounts that the Appellant controlled when this was not mentioned in the agreed facts in these proceedings nor was there any evidence that this amount related to the proceeding that was the subject of the sentence before His Honour;
(b) His Honour erred in taking into account the Appellant's trustee in bankruptcy's report and particularly the speculation that proceeding were not commenced as a result of a lack of litigation funding;
(c) His Honour erred in finding that the total loss was approximately $1,000,000 when the appellant should have been sentenced on each of the four counts based on the objective criminality of those offences and not on the basis of the total aggregate sum missing.
53Each of the offences involved the taking of money by the Applicant from persons on the basis that she would invest the money on their behalf by buying and selling Macquarie and Westpac Bank shares, with the Applicant then failing to do so.  Sequence 1 involved an amount of $178,000 from Ross and Ann Gemmell.  Sequence 7 involved an amount of $390,000 from Ross and Christopher Martin.  Sequence 3 involved the sum of $530,000 from Kathy Gundry and Maree Tisdell.  Sequence 4 involved the sum of $461,300 from Antonious Mak.  
54For completeness I should set out the amounts involved in the other offences taken into account on each of the Forms 1.  Sequence 2 involved $171,000, sequence 5 involved $40,000, sequence 6 involved $59,000, sequence 8 involved $35,000, sequence 9 involved $10,000, sequence 10 involved $110,000, sequence 11 involved $69,000, sequence 12 involved $20,000, sequence 13 involved $10,000 and sequence 14 involved $30,000.
55Some amounts were returned to each of the investors.  However, the overall net result was a loss amongst the victims totalling $1,095,314.  
56The offences, the subject of the appeal, were committed in the Newcastle area and are separate from other offences (to which reference will be made) committed by the Applicant in the Coffs Harbour area.  Although the Court Attendance Notices identified April 2007 to April 2008 as the period during which these Newcastle offences were committed, the Applicant, in her written submissions, said that the Newcastle offences ceased in December 2008.
The scheme
57The fraudulent scheme that the Applicant operated was described in the Agreed Facts on Sentence as a Ponzi scam.  It involved payment of returns to investors from their own monies or the monies of other investors rather than from any profit gained from the actual investment of the monies obtained by the offender.  In many cases, including the present, it involved dealing in cash only.  
58The details of the Applicant's scheme were contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts.  Those facts disclosed the following.
59The Applicant used a detailed and fictitious story to assist her in her fraudulent activities. The Applicant explained to the victims that she worked out of the Macquarie Bank Building in Sydney for multi-millionaires, whom she called the 'big boys'. She stated that she invested their money in blocks of $15 million, and bought and sold Macquarie and Westpac Bank shares on their behalf. She stated that she had an investment scheme where the 'big boys' allowed her to combine her and her family's money as well as the money from an additional 25 people into the investment scheme.  This scheme was referred to as the 'Macquarie Bank story'.
60The Applicant would arrive to meet with victims in a number of vehicles being a blue BMW convertible, which she stated was hers, and a Jeep which she stated a client had bought for her. The Applicant would also be dropped off by her husband John McKittrick in his burgundy BMW. The Applicant explained to victims that she had a safe in the boot of her car which was alarmed and sounded like a rattle snake. She stated that if her car was broken into, the alarm would sound and a phone call was automatically made to the Police and her husband. She stated that from this phone call, she was able to be tracked via satellite. The Applicant further told the victims that she carried a gun in the car and knew how to use it. The Applicant always presented to the victims as well dressed, and she wore a lot of gold jewellery.
61Upon meeting with the victims, the Applicant would most often present a document which she would claim as a licence to trade in shares. She would state that the licence had strict guidelines which required her to have an equal amount of money locked in a safety net account which would be used to refund clients if anything happened to her or went wrong with the investment. She stated that her solicitor had the details of all her clients, the amounts held by her on their behalf and that he had instructions to return the clients money if she became unable to work.
62The Applicant explained to the victims that she only dealt in cash amounts of $10,000 because cheques took too long to clear. She further said that the victims should not withdraw amounts greater than $10,000 as any amount higher than that were flagged with the banks for investigation. She refused to accept anything but cash.
63The Applicant would present receipts to the victims for monies received in the business name of TML Enterprises with addresses of PO BOX 654 Coffs Harbour NSW 2450 and 27 Cowell Street Dora Creek NSW 2264 with mobile phone numbers of 0420476612 and 0401950416. Returns would be paid to the victims in cash and presented to them in plain white envelopes with the date, the amount enclosed and their names hand written on the front by the Applicant. Most of the victims received regular returns for a number of months, on either weekly or fortnightly basis. The Applicant used the illusion of high yielding returns to encourage the victims to invest more money with her.
64The Applicant told the victims that their invested money was able to be withdrawn at any time, but she needed three months notice. She further stated that if they needed money for a big purchase, she would arrange a bank cheque for them out of their invested money. The Applicant also encouraged victims to take out loans to cover large purchases as the 'interest' returns they were receiving from their investment would cover their repayments. The victims who complied ended up paying interest on the money they invested with the Applicant and lost. She also encouraged victims to withdraw their superannuation funds, borrow money from family and friends and even sell their properties in order to be able to invest in some of her special, short term schemes with extraordinary returns. As a result, some victims sold their investment properties quickly and below their value so they would have cash to invest with the Applicant.
65When victims questioned the Applicant about paying tax on the returns of their investments, the Applicant stated that her company paid the tax on the money and that they didn't have to pay anything. She told victims not to call the money received back as 'interest' and that it was not income. She instead told them to call it an 'interest free investment loan'. The Applicant further offered to accompany victims to their tax agents and explain how the scheme worked for taxation purposes.
66The Applicant told victims that the business was originally her father's, and that her mother took it over after he died. She told victims that her mother taught her the trade, that her daughter Rebecca knew the business and would take over from her when she retired.67Upon victims meeting the Applicant and becoming interested in investing, the Applicant would often give them an upfront interest payment without any money being outlaid by them. This tactic was used by the Applicant to entice them into the scheme. If the victims were keen to invest with the Applicant after having the scheme explained to them, but did not immediately have the money to invest, the Applicant told them that she would invest on their behalf and when their money came through they could repay her.
68The Applicant told victims that her husband John McKittrick was a retired Highway Patrol Commander, and that his brother Paul was also in the Police Force. She further told them that John's son, Larry, was in charge of Crime Stoppers. The Applicant further explained to victims that her daughter Rebecca worked at the Portugal Resort from where Madeline McCann was abducted.
69The Applicant told the victims that she owned a time-share property at Hamilton Island and the Manly Pacific Resort. The Applicant offered for victims to use these time share properties.  However, these offers were never fulfilled. The Applicant explained to victims that she had sold her 'big house' on the lake and that they were downsizing, stating the gardener was costing too much and that the tennis court was never used. The Applicant offered victims furniture at no cost that she was removing from her 'big house', thus giving the impression to victims that she was wealthy. On occasions she even purchased presents for some victims and sent Christmas cards enclosing small amounts of money to build their trust in her. Victims who met her personally believed that they became friends with the Applicant.
70During the scheme, the Applicant recruited victim Kathy Gundry to act as her go-between with other victims, explaining that she was too busy to see every one face to face. The Applicant enquired with Ms Gundry if she was interested in taking over the business from her, explaining that she was near owning her own $15 million block and when that happened, she would become an investor with the Macquarie Bank not a broker. The victims that deal with the Applicant via Ms Gundry were told by Ms Gundry  who the Applicant was and that the Applicant was responsible for their money.  Ms Gundry further explained the Applicant's 'Macquarie Bank story'.
71On numerous occasions throughout the duration of the scheme, Ms Gundry attempted to give the Applicant some sums of money which she had received from other victims to invest with the Applicant. On these occasions the Applicant told Ms Gundry to use the money collected from the victims to pay them back their interest returns to which they were owed.
72Near the end of the scheme, the Applicant told the victims a number of fictitious health-related stories as to why she had not delivered their interest returns. The health-related illnesses she claimed to have were a brain haemorrhage, a stroke, heart problems, a blood clot, high blood pressure and an operation on her shoulder. She further told the victims that her home had been broken into and that she had had been robbed of $500,000 which she had withdrawn in order to pay them their interest returns.
73At the time she ran this scheme, the Applicant was being investigated for similar crimes committed in the Coffs Harbour area where she ran a similar Ponzi scam.  There was some dispute in the material on the appeal about the dates she operated the scheme in Coffs Harbour.  The Agreed Facts before Judge Maiden stated that the Coffs Harbour scheme operated between February 2005 and June 2007.  However, the Court Attendance Notices in respect of which she was sentenced by Judge Goldring for the Coffs Harbour offences stipulated periods between May 2003 and June 2007.  The Applicant, in her written submissions, accepted that the relevant period was May 2003 to June 2007.
74There were 33 offences in connection with the Coffs Harbour scam which involved defrauding victims of approximately 6 million dollars. She was arrested and charged on 5 September 2007 in relation to those offences and was released on bail to appear in Court on 3 October 2007.
75In the meantime, in May 2007 the Applicant consulted solicitors about her financial affairs and the possibility of bankruptcy.  She then filed her own petition on 13 June 2007 with the result that she went bankrupt on that day.  She continued to run the scheme in the Newcastle area whilst bankrupt.
76She also continued running this scheme in the Newcastle area whilst on bail for the Coffs Harbour offences. She told some of the victims that they might hear her name being mentioned in the media in relation to some allegations of fraud in Coffs Harbour. She told them her business partner was the one responsible for the fraud and that she had nothing to do with it. She subsequently informed them that her partner took responsibility for these actions and that all allegations against her were being dropped.
77The Applicant was sentenced by Judge Goldring in the District Court in Sydney on 28 May 2008 for the Coffs Harbour offences.  For each offence she received a two year non-parole period with an additional term of 18 months.  Some of the sentences were partially accumulated, resulting in a total effective sentence of a three year non-parole period with an additional term of one year and six months.  Her non-parole period expired on 27 May 2012.  It was that date that Judge Maiden chose as the date to commence the sentences he imposed.  
Subjective matters
78The Applicant was born on 26 December 1941.  She was, therefore, 65 and 66 at the date of offending, and 70 at the date she was sentenced.  She is now aged 72.  
79Information in various medical and psychological reports show that she had a fairly normal upbringing.  She felt academically inferior to her siblings who both were dux at their schools.  However, the Applicant achieved above average results academically.
80In about 2001 or 2002 she suffered a stroke which gave rise to her coming under the care of Associate Professor Silberberg, a cardiologist.  She had a congenital problem in respect of one of the valves to her heart.  She has had ongoing hypertension as well as high cholesterol levels.  At least since going into custody in 2009 she has suffered from Meniere's Disease.  She has mitral valve regurgitation as a result of childhood rheumatic fever.  She sufferered from anxiety and depression as well as cognitive impairment.  She was also found to have a meningioma in the right posterior cranial fossa in relation to the right internal auditory canal.
81Professor Silberberg provided a number of reports including one dated 5 August 2010.  His significant conclusions in that report were these:
(1) The Applicant is at significant risk of stroke of the order of 15% per year or higher.
(2) The main contributor to stroke risk is uncontrolled blood pressure, despite compliance with four drug treatments.
(3) This in turn is contributed to by incessant worry for her own wellbeing within the prison population.
(4) Release from custody would alleviate the anxiety state and reduce her stroke risk by about half.
82There was a lengthy report from Mr Tim Watson-Munro who diagnosed the Applicant suffering from a substantial Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression.  Mr Watson-Munro noted that two failed marriages against a backdrop of psychological abuse and infidelity had a dramatic impact on her.   He thought that the confluence of her physical and psychological problems at the time she became involved in the offending made her susceptible to manipulation and exploitation by others.  The Agreed Facts on Sentence, however, suggest that she was the person engaged in the manipulation and exploitation.
Grounds of appeal
83Because of the disparate nature of the grounds of appeal I have not hitherto referred to the Remarks on Sentence by Judge Maiden.  I shall  make reference to the relevant parts of those Remarks when dealing with each of the grounds, some of which are grouped for convenience.
Grounds 1, 2 & 3: Special circumstances and the statutory ratio
84The Sentencing Judge did not refer to special circumstances.  The overall non-parole period is almost 77% of the whole sentence.  The non-parole period in respect of Sequence 3 is 80% of the whole sentence.  His Honour said nothing in his remarks about these ratios.
85Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) contains no prohibition or constraint upon setting a balance of the term of a sentence at less than one third of the non-parole period:  AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 31 at [46].
86In Baghdadi v R [2012] NSWCCA 212 I said (with the concurrence of Macfarlan JA and Johnson J):
[32] This Court has said on a number of occasions that where the effect of accumulating the sentences results in an increase in the statutory ratio a failure of the Sentencing Judge to advert to the matter in his Remarks on Sentence will lead to an inference that the matter has been overlooked:  Wakefield v R [2010] NSWCCA 12 at [26]; Arnold v R [2011] NSWCCA 150 at [32]-[33] and Connelly v R [2012] NSWCCA 144 at [32].
87However, where it can be seen from the Remarks on Sentence that the final result was precisely what the Sentencing Judge intended, no error will be shown: AB v R at [55] - [57].  
88Although his Honour did not refer specifically to special circumstances he did make reference to a number of matters which suggest that the ultimate outcome of the sentencing exercise was what his Honour intended to achieve.  
89First, his Honour thought it was unlikely that she would re-offend.  However, he added the rider:
although based upon this matter, one does not know.  
He accepted, however, in that context that she would return to live with her husband where his Honour hoped that she would be able to resume living an ordinary life.  Those Remarks do not suggest that his Honour considered there was a need for an extended supervision period to assist with the Applicant's rehabilitation.  His Honour also noted the good progress that she had made whilst in custody, leading perhaps to the inference that no extended period under supervision would be needed at the expiry of the non-parole period.
90Secondly, his Honour had regard to the Applicant's age and state of health.  In particular, he said that in circumstances where gaol is to be significantly hard on her because of her age and health he proposed to take that into account.  He found that there was no care which she needed which was not available to her through Justice Health.  He said that he proposed to take into account her age when dealing with the sentence to be imposed for Sequence 4.  
91His Honour then imposed fixed terms for Sequences 1 and 7, both of which were wholly subsumed within the sentence for Sequence 3.  In relation to Sequence 4 he imposed a non-parole period which was only 57.14% of the total sentence for that Sequence.  
92His Honour then said that he had accumulated the sentences for Sequences 3 and 4 to reflect the criminality in respect of the Applicant's victims and in doing so he took into account as best he could the subjective matters, particularly her age and medical condition.  
93In my opinion, the approach his Honour took to the sentencing process indicated fairly clearly that the overall result involving a ratio of almost 77% was what his Honour intended to achieve.  Put another way, his Honour did not see any need to vary the statutory ratio overall but in fixing the sentences his Honour had regard to the significant subjective matters of the Applicant's age and health.
94In my opinion, no error is shown in relation to these grounds.
 Ground 4: Delay
95The chronology seems to be this.  
May 2003 to June 2007: Offences committed by the Applicant in Coffs Harbour.
April 2007: Applicant commences committing offences in the Newcastle area.
5 September 2007: Applicant charged with the Coffs Harbour offences and is released on bail.
December 2008:  Newcastle offences cease.
28 May 2009: The Applicant is sentenced by Judge Goldring in relation to the Coffs Harbour offences.  The effective sentence is a non-parole period of three years expiring 27 May 2012 with an additional term of 18 months.
August 2009: Detective Schultz takes Applicant from prison to Silverwater Police Station for interview in relation to the Newcastle offences.
March 2010: After requests by the Applicant's legal representative Detective Oliver confirms that Court Attendance Notices will issue for the Newcastle offences.
9 September 2011: Corrective Services are notified of the Newcastle offences.
21 December 2011: Court Attendance Notices for the Newcastle offences are filed in Maitland Local Court.
6 February 2012: The Applicant appears for the first time in the Local Court in relation to the Newcastle charges.
9 May 2012: The Applicant is committed for sentence to the District Court.  
15 June 2012: The Applicant appears in the District Court and adheres to her plea.
19 July 2012:   Sentence proceedings commence.
25 July 2012: The Applicant sentenced in respect of the Newcastle offences with a non-parole period to commence 27 May 2012 and expire 26 May 2017.
96On the face of it there is lengthy and unexplained delay from August 2009 until December 2011.  Although the Applicant was still serving out the sentence ordered by Judge Goldring that does not weaken the principle established in such cases as R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121; (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 at [11] and [16] and R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519.
97The matter of delay is not unrelated to evidence concerning the Applicant's rehabilitation whilst in prison and the selection by the Sentencing Judge of the expiry of the non-parole period ordered by Judge Goldring as the commencement date for the sentences imposed by the Sentencing Judge.
98The only reference made by the Sentencing Judge to delay was this (at ROS 5):
Next matter is that it was submitted that because of the delay in charging her with these matters the authorities having been aware of the matters, probably since at least 2007 and not having been charged until shortly before she was due to enter or to be eligible for parole, that this court should take into account that delay and in some way backdate or take into account those facts.  I will deal with that matter later in these Reasons when I consider all matters.
99His Honour's only other reference to the matter, somewhat oblique, is that he would backdate the sentence in respect of Sequence 3.  In fact, his Honour backdated the sentences for Sequences 1, 7 and 3 to 27 May 2012, the date that her non-parole period expired as ordered by Judge Goldring.  It is not clear in those circumstances whether his Honour has taken into account at all the issue of the delay.  That is emphasised by the fact that the authorities say that long delay, particularly where unexplained, entitles the offender to a significant element of leniency:  R v Todd at 519; Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64-66; and R v Blanco at [11] and [17].  For reasons to be discussed later in this judgment, the sentences imposed could not be regarded as lenient.100The matter is relevant in the Applicant's case for the further reason that in the meantime she had demonstrated some significant advances in rehabilitation by her prison behaviour.  His Honour noted that she was a model to other persons in the prison system and had been of great help to them.  He also noted the privileges that she had accrued whilst in prison as a result of her behaviour.
101It may be accepted that complaints about weight given to matters by a sentencing judge are to be dealt with on appeal if it can be shown there has been an error in discretion of a House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 type.  In the present case, however, there is no evidence that his Honour had any regard to delay when fixing the sentences.  His Honour's only reference to the matter concluded with the statement that he would deal with the matter later in the Reasons when he considered all matters.  There is no evidence that his Honour did so.  In failing to take account of a material consideration his Honour has fallen into error.
102This ground is made out.
Ground 5: Totality
103Reference has already been made in relation to Grounds 2 and 3 about the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentences.  If the sentences imposed by Judge Goldring are considered with the present sentences, the ratio produced is an indication that his Honour did not have regard to the principle of totality arising from the prior sentences.  
104The Crown submitted that the offences committed in Coffs Harbour concerned unrelated offending that occurred and had ceased by the time the present offences commenced.  However, the wrongful conduct was the same wrongful conduct.  All that had happened was that it was now being conducted in a different geographical location.  The methodology employed by the Applicant was the same.   
105The Sentencing Judge was obliged to take into account the sentence that the Applicant was already serving particularly given that the sentence was being served for identical offending:  R v MAK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [15];  Mill at 66-67.
106Whilst his Honour made a number of references to the Coffs Harbour matters and whilst he expressly commenced three of the sentences he imposed at the time of the expiry of the non-parole period for the Coffs Harbour matters, there is no indication that his Honour had regard to the totality principle in relation to the sentences imposed by Judge Goldring.  The Sentencing Judge not only made the sentences he imposed for the first three Sequences wholly cumulative on the sentence imposed by Judge Goldring he also made the sentence for Sequence 4 wholly cumulative on the sentences for Sequences 1, 7 and 3.  The overall result was a non-parole period of eight years with an additional term of 18 months.  That produces a ratio of 84.64%. 
107In my opinion, error is demonstrated by his Honour's failure to advert to the totality principle, to the overall effective sentence that he imposed bearing in mind Judge Goldring's sentences and to the ratio produced.  Although, as noted earlier, his Honour appeared to intend the result he achieved for the sentences he imposed, it does not appear that he intended the result when regard is had to Judge Goldring's sentences.
Ground 6: Contrition and remorse
108In AB v R RA Hulme J (with whom Beazley JA and Schmidt J agreed) said:
[43] The ""weight"" to be given to matters such as remorse and rehabilitation prospects is a matter for the discretionary assessment of a sentencing judge and the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify appellate intervention are narrowly confined: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] (Spigelman CJ). They fall for assessment under the principles of appellate review of discretionary decision-making set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.
109The Sentencing Judge found that in respect of her remorse he accepted that the Applicant was now sorry.  He also said, as noted earlier, that he accepted that it was unlikely she would re-offend.  The Sentencing Judge also noted that the Applicant was a model to other persons in the prison system and had been of great assistance to them.  
110The Applicant has not demonstrated how his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to these and other matters associated with contrition and remorse.  Of course, the inability to demonstrate such a failure serves to emphasise the very discretionary nature of the consideration of these matters.  Where the only complaint is that sufficient weight has not been given to a matter, it can be accepted that his Honour has given some weight to the matter.  How that reflects itself in the sentence is part of the intuitive synthesis of sentencing.  
111Error has not been demonstrated in relation to this ground.
Ground 7: The Applicant's medical condition
112The Applicant submitted that the Sentencing Judge did not give sufficient weight to Professor Silberberg's opinion about the increased risk of a stroke as a result of her incarceration.  The increased risk of stroke was made worse, it was submitted, because Mr Watson-Monroe had diagnosed her with a substantial anxiety disorder and major depression.  
113It is not suggested that the Sentencing Judge did not take account of her medical condition or the medical opinions.  Rather, it is said that not sufficient weight was attached to them.  
114The Sentencing Judge said this in relation to her health conditions:
The subjective matters also include matters of her health and there is no dispute that in 2001, perhaps 2002, she suffered a stroke which gave rise to her coming under the care of Associate Professor Silverberg, a cardiologist in Newcastle. That condition has resulted in her having to take considerable medications and to be conscious of the risks that she poses, not only to the risk of stroke, but also to heart attack because of a congenital problem in respect of one of the valves to the heart. She has also had other health difficulties, which I will not set out in detail. But suffice to say she has had a diagnosed major depressive and anxiety disorder for some period of time. That condition appears to have worsened prior, in 2008, at a time where she was preparing to be sentenced in respect of what has been described as the Coffs Harbour matters that came before Judge Goldring. 
I have read all the reports and the updated reports which have been summarised and a report of a psychologist Tim Watson-Munro, a psychologist who is well known in this court. Mr Watson-Munro has had access to the Justice Health documents that I have also read. The documents from Justice Health indicate that when the offender first came into custody she required considerable medications and it was observed of her that she would need the various pharmaceutical agents to assist her and to keep her in health. That position has not changed.
However, it appears that before custody she was concerned of how she would react in terms of her diagnosed depressive/anxiety disorder and she has, and that has proved to be so and she continues to be medicated in respect of that particular disability. She also has suffered problems with her cholesterol levels and as I have said a valve problem and other matters which have brought her under attention of the Justice Health authorities regularly.Before the matter came before Judge Goldring, both her cardiologist and psychiatrist, the psychiatrist being Dr Conaris indicated that being in custody would exacerbate her condition. Associate Professor Silverberg stressing that because of the relationship to anxiety and to having what he described as having to have a ""good head"" that she would suffer a hardship because of those particular problems.
There is no doubt that the Professor was correct in his assumptions and she has continued, to suffer in that way. But she has been medicated and to date, fortunately, she has not had any emergency which has caused her or which would be described as life threatening. I note that she does have some surgery that is proposed in respect of some matters which she would like to have done privately.
The opinions of Dr Conaris, Professor Silverberg and Mr Watson-Munro indicate that she would be in better health if she was not in custody and I do not have any difficulty with those observations. However, I will have to deal with that matter later when I come to assessing the subjective matters on behalf of the offender.
...
... In circumstances where that the gaol is to be significantly hard on her because of her age and health, and I propose to take that into account.
In the bottom line of the medical reports it reads that because she is in custody her anxiety depression and therefore its affect in respect of her other medical conditions, particularly her cardiac condition, are exacerbated. That is not to say that she cannot be treated and medicated in hospital, but it is a fact that if released and she was active then her health may improve. However, she has managed to cope adequately in respect of her recent confinement.
I find that there is no care that is not available to her through Justice Health whilst in custody, it may be more comfortable to her whilst not in custody but that does not appear to be the case.
115The question of weight is ultimately a matter for the Sentencing Judge.  It is clear that he properly considered all of the material in relation to her health.
116This ground fails.
Ground 8: Undue weight given to general deterrence
117There is no doubt that his Honour emphasised the matter of general deterrence at a number of places in his Remarks on Sentence.
118The Applicant submitted that general deterrence is attributed little weight in cases where an offender suffers from a mental condition or abnormality, because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example of:  Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53]-[54].  However, the principle has no application in the present case.  It is not suggested that these offences were committed as a result of any mental condition or abnormality in the Applicant.  
119At best, the Applicant's submissions have relevance to the issue of specific deterrence.  However, it is not even clear that that is so in the present case.  The Applicant suffered from a number of medical conditions prior to any offending.  None of those conditions appear to have had any influence in preventing the offending or tempering it.  Even after being arrested and charged with the Coffs Harbour offences and being released on bail the Applicant continued to offend.
120On the other hand, it may be accepted that by reason of the combination of her medical conditions at the time of sentencing and her age, specific deterrence, whilst still of relevance, might not be of the significance that it would otherwise be.  
121Whatever may be said about specific deterrence, his Honour was quite correct to emphasise general deterrence.  This was a white collar crime and general deterrence is of greater significance: R v Cameron [2005] NSWCCA 357 at [31]; John Michael Higgins v R [2006] NSWCCA 38 at [13]; R v Boulden [2006] NSWSC 1274 at [42] - [43]; R v Kelly [2006] NSWSC 1142 at [59] - [60].  
122There is no doubt that his Honour took into account the Applicant's age, psychological state and medical condition.  How those matters ultimately contributed to the sentence was within the discretion of the Sentencing Judge.  No error has been shown in this regard.
Ground 9: Objective seriousness
(a) Taking into account the amount of $13,677,437
123The Applicant had also been charged with two counts of obtaining a financial advantage from the Commonwealth and engaging in conduct to obtain a financial advantage from a Commonwealth entity.  The fact that those matters were committed in the context of the Coffs Harbour offences and the Newcastle offences for which Judge Maiden was sentencing the Applicant made the material associated with all of the charges relevant for consideration.  
124His Honour's only reference to this amount was as follows (ROS 7):
Also in respect of the Commonwealth matters there was evidence of considerable amounts of money being passed through various accounts that she had control of or interest in.  And the figure that comes to mind was an amount of $13,677,437 found in page 2 of the Statement of Facts tendered at the Toronto Local Court.  That document also indicates that there were withdrawals of money between five hundred and $2,000 from various clubs on the eastern coast of New South Wales.  There were also significant transactions at various fashion boutiques in Coffs Harbour and it would seem Sydney, as well as resorts and various hotels in Sydney and overseas.
125The Applicant submitted that this was an irrelevant consideration to take into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the four counts in respect of which the Sentencing Judge was passing sentence.
126It is not apparent from the Remarks that his Honour had regard to that matter for the purpose of assessing the objective seriousness of the individual offences.  Rather, it provided some background as associated information which was appropriate to take into account.  
(b) The trustee in bankruptcy's report
127The Sentencing Judge referred to the fact that the Applicant obtained legal advice and then filed her bankruptcy petition.  He noted that in her application she said that her unsecured creditors were just $500,000.  His Honour went on to say:
As it transpired the investigation by her trustee in bankruptcy found that initially they were of unsecured amounts in excess of four million and the final figure, in her estate, were in excess of $7.4 million.  Those monies I assume related to the Coffs Harbour matters.
128A little further on in his Remarks the Sentencing Judge referred to the Applicant's husband giving evidence at the sentencing hearing and to the fact that the Sentencing Judge directed Mr McKittrick's attention to a paragraph in the trustee in bankruptcy's report suggesting that assets purchased by the Applicant had been transferred to him for nil consideration.  The Sentencing Judge went on to say:
As I read the balance of the report I infer that the trustee was seeking creditors approval to commence litigation against Mr McKittrick to recover monies that were part of the creditors, or the unsecured creditors amounts.  This has not happened for reasons that I do not know, but one inference to be drawn is that the trustee was without funds and would have required either litigation lending referred to in his report or by cash being paid to him by one or other of the other creditors.
129The Applicant submitted that his Honour erred in taking into account that the trustee in bankruptcy may or may not have wished to pursue to Mr McKittrick to recover monies.  
130The Crown rightly pointed to the fact that it was defence counsel who tendered the bankruptcy report and that the Sentencing Judge used the bankruptcy to support a finding that it was unlikely any further money would be repaid.  
131As with the previous matter, it is not at all evident that this was a matter his Honour took into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending.  That it was used for other matters is clear when one reads the passage that immediately follows that quoted above where his Honour said:
In any event what the report confirms to me is the unreliability of the offender before me and in respect of what was her intent when she sought to go bankrupt, by seeking solicitor's advice back in May or June of 2007.  
132Her reliability was of significance before the Sentencing Judge for a number of reasons, not the least of which went to issues of contrition and remorse and to the likelihood of rehabilitation.  
(c) The total loss was approximately $1,000,000
133The Applicant pointed to five remarks made by the Sentencing Judge where reference was made to the total amount outstanding of something over $1,000,000, and how his Honour dealt with the four counts charged.  It was submitted that, contrary to what was said in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, his Honour should have imposed an appropriate sentence for each of the four individual offences based on the objective seriousness of those individual offences.  
134In fact, the last of the remarks objected to was this:
I have accumulated sequences 3 and 4 in that way to reflect your criminality in respect of your victims.
That remark seems to be entirely in accordance with Pearce and other authorities that discuss totality in sentencing.  
135Two of the sequences took into account a number of matters on two Form 1 documents.  It was entirely appropriate, therefore, that his Honour should make reference to the total amount that was outstanding for all of the victims.  
136One of the passages to which the Applicant took exception was this:
The Form 1 matters are serious in their own right and for that reason I read each of the matters out earlier.  And again it brings it again as a second reason into the worst case scenario because of the number of investors and of the amounts not received back by most of them.  
137The Applicant drew attention to what was said in Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 at [22] by Bathurst CJ:
The existence of these additional offences may demonstrate the greater need for personal deterrence and retribution in respect of the offence charged. This does not mean the court is imposing a separate penalty for the Form 1 offences. Rather, as part of the instinctive synthesis approach to sentencing explained by McHugh J in Markarian v R  [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]-[54], it takes these matters into account as required by the statute in determining the appropriate penalty for the offence for which the offender is convicted.

138There is no indication in the passage in the Remarks referred to that his Honour was doing other than was referred to in Abbas or by McHugh J in Markarian v R  [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.  
139The assessment of objective seriousness is ultimately one for the sentencing judge.  It is not demonstrated that any of the passages referred to were used or misused by the Sentencing Judge in assessing objective seriousness.  The matters in those Remarks were relevant to a number of considerations in the sentencing process. 
140No error is shown in relation to this ground.
Re-sentence
141The two areas where error has been demonstrated are both significant matters in terms of sentence.  It is convenient to consider the sentences and the totality principle first.  As noted, the overall result of the sentences imposed by Judge Goldring and Judge Maiden was a non-parole period of eight years with an additional term of 18 months.  The sentences imposed by Judge Maiden were discounted by 25% for the early plea.  The notional starting point for his sentences was, therefore, 8.66 years.  If that is added to the three year non-parole period that the Applicant served as a result of Judge Goldring's sentence before commencing to serve the present sentences the notional starting point for all offences was 11.66 years.  If there was no variation to the statutory ratio that would produce an undiscounted non-parole period of 8.7 years.    
142Even without considering the discount that ought to have been given because of the delay, that is a severe sentence even having regard to the amounts of money involved in the scams.  
143Further, the notional starting point for the sentences actually imposed by Judge Maiden of 8.66 years must be regarded as near the top of the range bearing in mind the Applicant's age and health issues.  That sentence does not take into account the discount that ought to have been given for the long delays in charging the Applicant for the offences committed in the Newcastle area.
144In my opinion, the Applicant should be re-sentenced in relation to Sequences 3 and 4 as follows, with no alteration being made to the two fixed terms for sequences 1 and 7, which have now expired.
Sequence 3, taking into account three matters on the Form 1, imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to commence 27 May 2012 and expiring 26 November 2014 with a balance of term of 1 year 3 months expiring 26 February 2016.
Sequence 4, taking into account seven matters on the Form 1, imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years to commence 27 May 2014 and expiring 26 May 2016 with an additional term of 1 year 6 months expiring 26 November 2017.
145In that regard, I would find special circumstances by reason of the Applicant's age and serious health conditions.
Conclusion
146I propose the following orders:
1. Grant leave to appeal;
2. Appeal allowed;
3. Quash the sentences imposed by Judge Maiden in respect of Sequences 3 and 4;
4. In lieu, sentence the Appellant as follows:
(a) Sequence 3, taking into account three matters on the Form 1, imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to commence 27 May 2012 and expiring 26 November 2014 with a balance of term of 1 year 3 months expiring 26 February 2016.
(b) Sequence 4, taking into account seven matters on the Form 1, imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years to commence 27 May 2014 and expiring 26 May 2016 with an additional term of 1 year 6 months expiring 26 November 2017.
147ADAMSON J:  I have read in draft the judgments of Simpson and Davies JJ.  I respectfully adopt the comprehensive statement of facts contained in Davies J's draft. I agree with Simpson and Davies JJ for the reasons their Honours have given that grounds 1 to 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 have not been made out. Grounds 4 and 5 remain to be considered.
Ground 4: delay
148Delay is a relevant consideration. The Sentencing Judge specifically referred to delay in the remarks on sentence in the passage set out by Davies J. I consider that this reference is sufficient to indicate that his Honour did take into account delay. Although his Honour foreshadowed that he would ""deal with that matter later"" in the reasons, I do not understand his Honour to be saying other than that the delay would be taken into account when fixing the sentences for individual offences and the total sentence. For the reasons given by Simpson J I agree that it was open to the Sentencing Judge to take into account delay but not to reduce the total sentence accordingly. The approach taken by the Sentencing Judge does not, in my view, reveal error.149Accordingly I am not persuaded that this ground has been made out.
Ground 5: totality
150As appears from the judgments of Simpson and Davies JJ, the combined total sentence imposed on the Applicant, when one takes account of the sentences imposed by Judge Maiden and Judge Goldring, was a non-parole period of eight years with an additional term of 18 months. The ratio produced is 84.21%.
151Simpson J considers, for the reasons her Honour has given, that it is appropriate to restructure the sentence so as to leave the combined total term intact but to reduce the non-parole period by a year so as to reflect the statutory ratio provided for in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The effect of her Honour's approach is that the non-parole period will expire on 26 May 2016 and the balance of the term will expire on 26 November 2018.
152Davies J considers, for the reasons his Honour has given, that it is appropriate to find special circumstances and restructure the sentence so as to reduce by a year both the total non-parole period (such that it expires on 26 May 2016) and the total length of term (such that it expires on 26 November 2017) by a year.
153Notwithstanding Davies J's careful consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, I am not satisfied that this Court, in re-sentencing the Applicant, ought find special circumstances. 
154The statutory prohibition in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) on structuring a sentence such that the ratio is smaller than the statutory ratio unless special circumstances are found requires reasons to be given for any such finding. There is no requirement for reasons to be given when the ratio between the non-parole period and the total term exceeds the statutory ratio. However where reasons are not given for the excess, there is at least an implication that the Sentencing Judge has not appreciated the mathematical effect of two sentences on the overall ratio. I am satisfied that this is what has occurred in the instant case.
155I agree for the reasons given by Simpson J that ground 5 has been made out and that the Applicant ought be re-sentenced. I agree with the orders that her Honour has proposed.

2764337,R v Pincham [2014] NSWDC 363,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Paul John Pincham appears today for sentence in relation to two offences. One matter involves a sentence for an offence to which the offender pleaded on arraignment in this Court. The charge to which he pleaded guilty on indictment alleged that he between 19 July 2011 and 4 April 2012 at Boambee in the State of New South Wales did supply not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely 271 grams of methylamphetamine. That particular offence is an offence contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. It carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and/or a fine expressed in a particular number of penalty units that equates to $385,000. There is a standard non-parole period, I am informed by the Crown, of 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	There is also a related offence on a s 166 certificate for which the prisoner is to be sentenced pursuant to s 167 Criminal Procedure Act. This is an offence of dealing with certain property, to wit, $3,520 in Australian currency, for which there are reasonable grounds to suspect that it is the proceeds of crime. To that offence, an offence contrary to s 94C(1) Crimes Act 1900, the offender pleaded guilty in this Court. That carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment and/or $5,500 by way of fine.
	
	
	The offender was charged in relation to the matters generally with which I am concerned in early April 2012. He was charged with a number of offences, and I will deal with that aspect of the matter when I come to the question of the discount to be given for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.
	
	
	He has been in custody for various periods of time. Initially from 4 April 2012 until mid-September 2012, and then again between mid-February 2014 and early March 2014. The total period of time that he was in custody directly referable to the current matters in their various forms as they have moved their way from the Local Court to the District Court is expressed as “five months 35 days”. As we know, there are no months in the calendar that extend beyond 31 days, a matter I had not picked up when I was looking at the prosecution’s “case summary”. But it is agreed between the learned Crown Prosecutor and learned Senior Counsel for the accused that, in reality, the totality of the time in custody would appear to take the commencement date of any appropriate sentence, all other matters taken into account, as about 13 January 2014, and I have determined that the commencement date should be 12 January 2014, to avoid any mathematical error.
	
	
	In relation to the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty (getting ahead of myself in one sense because there were matters raised specifically in the submissions directed to this matter that need to be take into account) there will be a transcript no doubt prepared of the proceedings before me which will show that learned Senior Counsel for the accused and myself had a detailed discussion and various particulars on this issue were provided to me. The Crown assisted too. I am required to give a discount in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton v The Queen. The ‘guideline judgment’ in relation to discounts for pleas of guilty, delivered in 1999 by the Court of Criminal Appeal. It was submitted by both the parties that the range of discount should be somewhere between 10% and 15%. The Crown thought it might be slightly less than 15%. I somewhat light-heartedly suggested perhaps 13 and a fraction per cent, but not to make light of the situation. I have ultimately concluded, having regard to some of the complexities concerning the background of this matter, that it would be appropriate, in recognition of what has been assessed as the character of utilitarian benefit, to give a discount of 15%. I do not propose to go into the detail of why I have come to that conclusion beyond noting that although the plea of guilty was entered after the matter was actually listed to commence for trial. It is to be pointed out this accused was one of 12 co-accused.
	
	
	The way the court list is managed in the District Court, as is well known, the Chief Judge permits the parties to enter into negotiations and sort out difficulties before a matter is allocated to a judge. It is clear from the information given to me by the Crown that those discussions were very fruitful, saving the court and the community many weeks of trial, even if only in relation to the accused before me today. Ten of the 12 pleaded guilty to various offences. Two persons are awaiting trial. I accept, without recounting the detail, the accused ultimately pleaded guilty to one count when he was facing a number of counts for which he had been committed for trial, and there was considerable uncertainty as to precisely the quantity of drug for which he should be responsible for supplying. The detailed agreed facts reflect a quantity of the drug considerably less than the quantity that was particularised in one of the committal charges relating to the accused. As was pointed out, there were many, many telephone intercept calls that would have been required to be played. Ultimately I have concluded that the plea of guilty, timed as it was some time after the date of the proposed commencement of the trial, reflected a considerable - in the circumstances and notwithstanding a committal for trial - saving to the community. Thus I have accorded the prisoner a discount of 15%.
	
	
	I have told the offender what the sentence is I propose to impose. I do not believe that prisoners should be sitting waiting with bated breath for a Judge to deal with all the things that a judge is obliged to deal with, given the complexity of our sentencing law. The ultimate sentence that I have foreshadowed to the prisoner represents that discount applied to a commencement or a starting point, before the discount, of six years imprisonment.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are set out in an agreed statement of facts. There are some pertinent matters to extract from the agreed statement of facts, but no need to repeat all of them.
	
	
	An investigation was commenced into the activities relating to members and associates of a group of persons as members of what was described as the “Lone Wolves Outlaw Motorcycle Gang” which was located in Coffs Harbour. The agreed facts state that the offender, who was born in July 1967 and appears today before this Court as I would understand it aged 46 years, was a member of that club and became a target of the investigation. Various mobile phones used by individuals within the group were the subject of surveillance and there were listening devices used as well. I am provided with various details relating to conversations that are said to be pertinent to the scope of the joint criminal enterprise in which the offender was concerned, both concerning other members of the joint criminal enterprise and the offender. The offender, if I have not already mentioned, was known as “Bull” within the organisation or the group. It is clear from the very limited detail of the conversations that a code was used to describe particular activities, which is obviously commonplace in drug supply matters.
	
	
	Ultimately the evidence reveals that a particular person, Michael Why, was giving instruction and direction in relation to the provision of other members of the club, including this offender, of particular drugs, particularly methylamphetamine, for them to sell on to other people. This occurred over a period of time between early January and the arrest of the offender on 4 April 2012. Various details were provided as to matters concerning earlier conversations in October 2011 when conversations between the offender and other persons related to the sale of methylamphetamine and related activities.
	
	
	The Crown case is, in the context of the information provided to the Court, that the offender was supplying other people two eight-balls of methylamphetamine, or a total of seven grams per week, an eight-ball representing 3.5 grams. The total amount he supplied over the period covered by the indictment, as the facts state, of 31 weeks was 217 grams based upon that calculation. There is a specific supply that is also to be taken into account taken on 21 March 2012. On this occasion the offender supplied 54.66 grams of methylamphetamine to an associate, a person as I would understand it was an associate of the group or a member of the group that I have earlier referred to known as the Lone Wolves Motorcycle Gang or Club. This supply, occurring on the afternoon of 21 March 2012, was arranged by Mr Why at the request of the ‘President’ of the club, and the details of the supply are set out in the facts. I need not reflect upon those with any particularity.
	
	
	The reason that the facts refer, and the prisoner admits, to the “actual supply” of 54.66 grams, is that that quantity of the drug was recovered from the person to whom the accused had supplied the rugs on the arrangement of Mr Why and at the direction of a man known as Neville Luck, the President of the club. The drugs taken from Mr Horn, the man who was provided the drugs by the prisoner, was analysed. Their weight was identified. They had a purity of 15.5%. I accept if I might anticipate matters I will deal with relating to the submissions, that the drugs that were being supplied by the offender over the period of time contemplated by the indictment of the context of the agreed facts were of about this percentage. Certainly the 54.66 grams by reference to the analyst’s certificate was of that purity. This is in accordance with what could be called street levels of purity. I have seen in my experience over a number of years a range of purity at street level between 3% up to 15 or 20%. It is clear on the facts available to the Court that the offender, to use the expression of his learned Senior Counsel, was a ‘middleman’ in the sense of the person obtaining the drugs from someone within the club who was giving directions as to the supply of drugs from time to time. Certainly the prisoner was given directions in relation to the particular supply on 21 March. Earlier supplies are suggested by the telephone intercepts to be by the offender to people that he had connected with for the purposes of providing them with methylamphetamine, some people associates of the club, others outside the club.
	
	
	There is no suggestion of the prisoner corrupting other people, forcing them into the use of prohibited drugs. It is quite clear that he over a period of time had an established group of persons who could obtain drugs from him for their own use, and I accept, if it is an adequate expression, that the prisoner was a “user/dealer” in the sense that he himself was a user of drugs. There is no doubt just by reference to his possession of the amount of cash at the premises where he lived on the execution of a search warrant on 12 April 2012 that apart from obtaining prohibit drugs for himself from his activities, he also obtained some cash. But the only evidence of any financial enrichment, if I could use that expression in a very loose way, was the particular cash the subject of the related charge, but no doubt over a period of time he obtained cash that he may have used for a range of circumstances. Certainly I accept the essential submissions of learned Senior Counsel for the accused about that aspect of the matter.
	
	
	I will come back to dealing with the objective facts when I come to the question of the ‘standard non-parole period’ and its relevance in this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	The prisoner is a person with prior criminal convictions. They go back over a period of time to 1986. He is, as I understand it, a person who is a native of, or certainly grew up in, the town of Narrabri, south of Moree. He has convictions in Narrabri Court, some of considerable seriousness. I note in fairness to him, and it was adverted to in one specific sense by his counsel, that after a period of offending between 1986 and 1999, which included the imposition of some terms of imprisonment and required the prisoner to serve at least a minimum term of three years from 1999 onwards, there was a break in the prisoner’s offending to 2009 when he was convicted at Coffs Harbour, where he was then presumably living, of a relatively minor matter of damaging property, for which he was fined $300. Then there was a break to the commencement of his involvement in the supply offence and other offending which is reflected in the criminal history.
	
	
	He has convictions in the Local Court for street offences, possession of drug, violence in the sense of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and driving with a high range PCA. I accept the criminal history shows a use of prohibited drugs that goes back at least 25 years. He was convicted of having an unlicensed firearm in 1999 for an offence for which he was charged in June 1997 which appears to have been dealt with at the same time as he was dealt with in relation to other serious offending. That other serious offending included conviction at the same time in November 1999 of shooting with intent to cause grievous bodily harm for which he was sentenced to a minimum term of 15 months, that sentence partly accumulative upon another sentence imposed, and other offending was taken into account. He appealed against his sentence in relation to that matter but the appeal was dismissed.
	
	
	He was also convicted on that date, 11 November 1999, in relation to an offence for which he was charged in January 1999. In other words, when he was finally dealt with in the District Court at Narrabri he was sentenced for a range of offences for which he had been charged over a period of time. The offence for which he was further sentenced in November 1999 was an offence of manufacturing a prohibited drug, to wit, methylamphetamine, for which he was convicted and sentenced to a minimum term of three years imprisonment commencing on 9 November 1999, that non-parole period concluding in 2002. That gives sense to the character of the sentence that was imposed for the shoot with intent to cause grievous bodily harm matter. The Crown has in fact provided me with a copy of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to the appeals the prisoner brought in respect of the sentences imposed at Narrabri. That judgment is The Queen v Pincham [2000] NSWCCA 478. Although it very briefly deals with the facts the subject of concern in the appeal, the sole purpose of the appeal was to deal with the issue of backdating of the sentence, I have taken that judgment into account to the extent that it sheds some further light on that offending.
	
	
	When the offender was released, I take it from the criminal history and the custodial record, he successfully completed the parole supervision required of him. However, as I said, in 2009 he was convicted of destroying property whilst in Coffs Harbour. I take it this was at a time close to, or including, when he was involved with the motorcycle group to which I have referred.
	
	
	More disturbingly was the fact that prior to being charged in relation to the current matters with which I am concerned, on 25 January 2012, he was charged with and then, on 11 October 2013, convicted of three offences, being assault occasioning actual bodily harm, destroying or damaging property, and stealing from a person. In relation to those three matters in October 2013 he was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment to be served by way of Intensive Correction Order. For the assault occasioning actual bodily harm he was sentenced to 19 months imprisonment commencing on 11 October 2013, for the damaging of property he was sentenced to five months imprisonment commencing from the same date, and he was also sentenced to 14 months imprisonment in respect of the steal from a person matter commencing from the same date.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Service has reported to the Court that he has up until this point completed that ICO satisfactorily. That is a relevant matter to consideration of an important issue advanced on behalf of his counsel. There has been some progress the prisoner has made in his rehabilitation in a number of ways reactive to his charging with the current matters. The sentences imposed of course by way of Intensive Correction Order are in place. I would assume the Parole Authority will revoke those sentences because of the sentence I impose. They would of course need to do that if I imposed any term of full time custody because that interrupts the ICOs.
	
	
	I have considered the issue of what relevance those sentences have in framing the sentence with which I am concerned. The offences have relevance in the sense that to some extent the offender was on bail in relation to those offences when committing at least a number of the activities that give rise to the principal charge with which I am concerned. Thus, there is the aggravating factor, militated in the way advanced by his counsel as to the limited period of time over which the offending with which I am concerned occurred, of committing an offence whilst subject to conditional liberty.
	
	
	There is the question too of backdating the sentence that I am imposing to give effect to the time spent in custody solely referable to the current matters. In my view, I should not diminish that period of time simply because the prisoner has been serving some other sentence. I have of course the discretion made clear, for example, in a case like Callaghan dealing with a separate situation where one is sentencing an offender who has had his or her parole revoked, to adjust the commencement date to give effect to the issue of totality by reference to other sentences imposed or required to be imposed for other offending.
	
	
	I have concluded that I should give the prisoner full benefit of the time spent in custody for the offences with which I am concerned, or the principal offence with which I am concerned, and this means as a third consideration that there is a partial accumulation upon those sentences. This is a matter relevant to the fixing of the non-parole period in itself, is a ‘special circumstance’, pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	When the Sentencing Act was passed in the early days of the Greiner government in 1989, the Court of Criminal Appeal recognised in a number of early judgments that the partial accumulation of one sentence upon another which required the fixing of a non-parole period reflected a “special circumstance” requiring the adjustment at least to that limited extent of the effect of that accumulation to give proper effect to what was sometimes called mistakenly the “statutory ratio” of non-parole period to total sentence. In this particular matter I have concluded that that itself of course is a special circumstance, as are the other matters that have been referred to by Senior Counsel for the prisoner, which I will come to in a moment.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Department, as it is now known, of Corrective Services, confirms a number of matters that emerge from the other evidence in the case: the psychologist’s report based upon information provided by the prisoner and the character references that the prisoner has made a number of changes in his life since his arrest in relation to the current matters in early April 2012. It was true that he was bail refused apparently for some period of time. He was granted bail. He went back into custody for a period of time because of a belief that he had been in breach of a bail condition, which turned out either to be unsatisfactorily established or not correct, then whilst on bail the prisoner has been subject to substantially restrictive bail conditions at least for eight months of the time he was on bail. These conditions included requirements for him to report daily, which in the circumstances is not itself an onerous condition given the alternative that was available of him remaining in custody, but also being subject to curfew. It has been put to me from the bar table, and I accept it without question, that he was subject to a number of curfew checks, and I have taken that matter into account. It is a relevant matter to the extent that it may be considered as an additional restriction upon the liberty of the offender whilst awaiting sentence in relation to the current matters.
	
	
	The Community Corrections officer has reported on the satisfactory performance of the ICO that I have already referred to. In relation to previous supervision, on one occasion his supervision was terminated early due to satisfactory response. Although, of course, this is in the circumstance where, as I understood the chronology from the report, the offender had previously been on parole. There is not much detail about his previous conduct during parole but there is no evidence of revocation.
	
	
	From the histories that are provided to me through the psychologist’s report and the pre-sentence report, the offender grew up in Narrabri. He was educated to year 10. He obtained a qualification in plastering. He worked in the shearing industry and as a general labourer in a range of ways, and I accept after his release from gaol, after the sentence imposed in 1999, he suffered an industrial accident of some description which left him incapable of doing work that he formerly did. He has been receiving a disability support pension for a number of years because of a substantial injury to his back.
	
	
	I have already reflected upon the fact that there is evidence of him being a user of prohibited drugs for a lengthy period of time. He was a regular user of cannabis and amphetamines over a period of time. In 2012 he was diagnosed with hepatitis C. He also injected himself intravenously during the time that he used prohibited drugs, particularly amphetamines. He successfully completed, to his credit, the Interferon Program which is an abstinence based program. There is one minor relapse recorded, but otherwise he has remained abstinent. He has used some cannabis on occasions to reduce anxiety. What has emerged, and I did not realise that it was possible for this to occur, but I am told through the information available to the Court and the submissions of Senior Counsel for the accused that the offender is clear of hepatitis C by reason of the treatment.
	
	
	The Community Corrections Service deem him to be at “low-medium” risk of reoffending. This is a matter that might be taken into account to militate against a finding of special circumstances, in the context of the consideration of the relevant issue to such a matter as to whether an adjustment of a non parole period was required to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender. Given his previous criminal history and given his previous dependence upon the use of prohibited drugs and his previous associations, it is clear to me that he does need an extended period of supervision to assist him to adjust to community living and to assist him in a material sense in obtaining guidance in relation to matters that might lead to relapse.
	
	
	The offender impressed the Community Corrections Service as being a person who was seeking to change his ways, and that he was “prepared and resolved” to receiving a term of imprisonment, but was also anxious to have the opportunity to redeem himself in the wider community. This is something that comes from the referees. A number of people that have dealt with him have spoken highly of his loyalty, of his “honesty” in his dealings with other people. One referee refers to him as a person who has exhibited a “great deal of remorse and a strong desire to repay” for his past errors. The referee’s exuberance for his character refers to him as a “fine, upstanding, reliable and honest citizen.” I appreciate of course that is meant in good faith to represent the impression that the offender makes upon the referee, but of course aspects of his criminal history suggest otherwise.
	
	
	He has displayed support for others in times of need that is attested to in the references that I have. One particular referee, who first met him in 2009, has written through that referee’s observation of him since that time of the considerable change that has occurred since his arrest in April 2009. This referee has spoken of his honesty, about his past, his membership of the motorcycle club, the need for him to change his approach to life to avoid further offending, taking responsibility for his previous conduct, and endeavouring in fundamental ways to change what is described as his “mindset and outlook.” The referee, a business consultant and workplace trainer, and I take it from that a person of substance within her community, speaks of his remorse and accepting responsibility for his conduct, and his behaviours and attitudes had provided him with the instruments to maintain pro social connection with the community.
	
	
	One other document that was produced, and I have taken it into account, is an affidavit prepared for one of the bail applications from a former National Serviceman and Vietnam veteran for whom the prisoner has been a carer. I have taken that material into account. It shows again, as often is the case with people who are to appear for sentence in relation to serious crimes, that there is another side to the character of that person. The prisoner has provided considerable support to a man in strong need of that support given his own conditions of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and has shown him sympathy and compassion, which I have taken into account.
	
	
	I have also taken into account the evidence by way of urinalysis reports that the prisoner has been effectively drug-free since his release from custody on bail and whilst subject to bail conditions.
	
	
	If I can just briefly deal with the psychologist’s report. That sets out a number of details about the prisoner’s background beyond what’s in the pre sentence report. I appreciate the prisoner did not give evidence. Much of the history that he has given to others has not been subject to test by the Crown. I am very mindful of the need for the Court to be circumspect in many instances about the histories that are provided in such circumstances. But I am prepared to accept essentially what is set out in the histories provided by the prisoner. He has a daughter aged 23 and a son 20. He has during the course of time on bail re-established contact with his family or his children at least, particularly his daughter.
	
	
	He has no history of mental health treatment but he has had traumas in the past. Some reflection in the history upon his convictions in 1999, or some of them, reveal the fact that he has a scar on his face from where the barrel of another man’s shotgun was rammed into him. Since that event and his sentencing whilst in custody in the early part of the century he had a number of flashbacks and nightmares about his experiences. It would appear as though without all the facts available to me that some of the matters for which he was sentenced in 1999 involved some acts of violence, not by him alone, but by others towards him. He saw many terrible things in custody, of which I have no doubt. People committing suicide or being found dead after having committed suicide and acts of violence. I bear in mind the opinion of the psychologist that these traumas in the past are still having an impact upon him.
	
	
	That having been said, and I do not mean this unkindly of the prisoner or in criticism of him, but the reality is, as I explained to his counsel, that a reasonable person might think that the terrible things that he has endured and seen may have been some incentive for him to avoid offending. I appreciate the difficulty, as Justice Simpson made clear in Henry, for people who are dependent upon prohibited drugs not being able to make many conscious decisions about their circumstances. This is a matter also confirmed to some extent in the judgment of Justice Wood in the same decision. I particularly refer to his observations at [273] of that judgment and the fact that people who are dependent upon drugs do not make considered decisions.
	
	
	The prisoner was intensely surveilled by the police. I am told that 20 25% of the telephone intercepts involve the offender over a period of a number of months. I raised in a questioning way whether there are any statements of regret about his conduct or expressions by the prisoner of the effect upon him of the prison as he discussed the plans for the criminal conduct with which I am concerned. As I understood it, no such statements were made by him. It has to be fairly said that these unguarded conversations really provide ‘the proof of the pudding’. In other words, whilst I accept the prisoner has been affected by his previous experiences in custody, they did not deter him from endeavouring, at least, to reconsider his involvement in the current offending.
	
	
	I also appreciate, in fairness to him without suggesting it is an excuse, that he was a member of a group of men for whom I expect living outside the law was something of a norm. I am appreciative of the pressures arising out of a group mentality of that type. But there is no suggestion that he was an unwilling member of that group. As he appreciates by what he actually said to the Community Corrections officer, he has to take responsibility for his conduct. He has also made that clear to his referees.
	
	
	The psychologist reports, which the Community Corrections Service seems to confirm, that the prisoner has sought to turn around his life whilst on bail. He sought to cease his association with what are described by the psychologist as “criminal elements.” He has taken steps to address his health over the period of time since his arrest in April 2012.
	
	
	He gives an account of his involvement in the offending with which I am concerned. He notes the severe impact of his own drug use on himself over a number of years, the cost to him of his family life, of employment opportunities, and of course his freedom on occasions. He indicated insight in relation to his offending, which I believe is a positive matter. He finds the prospect of going to prison again a much harder matter to bear now that he is older, and I accept that, and he is very concerned about the need for vigilance.
	
	
	There was some psychometric testing undertaken so far as assessment of depression and anxiety and stress. His anxiety is assessed as ‘severe’. His current state of depression was assessed as moderate, and stress was within normal limits. These are matters as the summary states that are reactive to his current circumstances. With regard to matters of distress that might be diagnostic of post-traumatic stress disorder, he has an elevated score in that regard, the post-traumatic stress disorder arising from his experiences prior to going to gaol and also within custody.
	
	
	The psychologist noted that he believed from the information available to him that the prisoner was successfully rehabilitated from years of drugs. Past conduct would have attracted a diagnosis of substance use disorder, but it no longer exists. His risk of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms is high, particularly going back into custody as a possible trigger. The conclusions the psychologist reaches, in the context of the history that I have outlined and the positive steps the prisoner has taken, are that the prisoner has made steps in his rehabilitation, but there are risk elements for him and he demonstrated a clear commitment to rehabilitation.
	
	
	He was apprehensive about sentencing. He was vulnerable to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder whilst in custody. The future rehabilitation and treatment of the prisoner was a matter that had reached a point where it was important to consolidate the gains he had made and that the prisoner’s motivations in the context of the psychometric testing were “sufficiently intact.” The psychologist recommends continuing psychological and/or psychiatric intervention.
	
	
	I have taken all those matters into account in the prisoner’s favour. I am mindful of the fact that there will be stresses in custody, although this is not a matter that gives rise to any direct consideration of those principles that are satisfied in Hemsley v The Queen, the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal from 2004, or in the 2010 decision of De La Rosa.
	
	
	If I may just turn briefly to the submissions of the Crown, because although the defence did not reply to the Crown’s submissions directly, many of the matters that came from the learned Senior Counsel of the accused provided a reply to the matters the Crown submitted.
	
	
	In the context of the consideration of the standard non-parole period, the Crown said that the offending fell within the lower end of the middle range, noting particularly the “ongoing supply” characteristic of the offending over a period of time, and the system of distribution involving the use of code and the like. The Crown agreed that the prisoner was a middleman within the relevant “syndicate.” This is a middleman in the context of people within the club, of which he was a member, providing him with drugs for him to either supply to targeted people known to the club or other people who were customers of him. The Crown submitted that there were several aggravating factors that arose under s 21A(2). These included the fact that the offending was part of organised criminal activity, that the prisoner’s criminal history was an aggravating factor, and at least on one view of it the partial breach of conditional liberty was an aggravating factor.
	
	
	Learned Senior Counsel for the accused dealt with the issue of the discount for the plea, and I have already dealt with that matter, and the Crown submitted that it was clear that a full term of custody was required. Learned counsel for the prisoner did not in her submissions, that came first of course, acknowledge the aggravation of an offence committed as part of organised criminal activity. Of course, if aggravation required to be established under the Act, particularly under s 21A(2), is one that needs to be established beyond reasonable doubt. I had a discussion with the learned Crown about this matter, which obviously is recorded, and to summarise my conclusion in relation to the matter, I cannot conclude that this is particularly an offence that was committed as part of organised criminal activity. I am mindful the prisoner was a member of a group of men that could be described as a gang. But this was an organised group, sometimes described as an ‘outlaw motorcycle group’, that was involved in a range of activities, obviously in relation to the supply of methylamphetamine, some criminal, others more social. The truth of the matter is the wider context of the commission of the offences was through the prisoner’s association with the group. Through his dependence upon methylamphetamine which, as I understand the evidence, pre-dates his membership of the group.
	
	
	It seems to me that there needs to be in this matter, in the context of what I am required to be satisfied of beyond reasonable doubt, some consideration of the distinction that may be drawn as a reasonable possibility between organised criminal activity and criminal activity of an offender in the context of his membership of an organisation that is not solely in existence for the purposes of committing crimes. I know there are members of the community that might regard outlaw motorcycle gangs as solely being in existence for the commission of crime. I have got no evidence in this matter to suggest that this is the case here.
	
	
	I am also mindful too of the caution in what Justice Howie has said in a number of decisions about the character of supply offences of this type given the inherent organisation and planning required in order for the offence to be committed in any form. Thus, I am not satisfied to the requisite degree of that aggravating factor. Of course, learned Senior Counsel for the prisoner addressed her submissions to what she anticipated may be the relevant aggravating factors that arise under s 21A(2) of the Act. She specifically dealt with the issue of criminal history and the breach of conditional liberty. This is acknowledged as an aggravating factor. But it is mitigated it is said because of the uncertain period during which the prisoner was on bail.
	
	
	I accept that the prisoner was on bail in relation to unrelated criminal activity as I understand it, certainly not in relation to drug supply matters. Although it is an aggravating factor, here it is not as serious an aggravating factor given the temporal connections and other features as might be an offence committed of a similar type whilst on parole, which obviously would be far more serious.
	
	
	As to the matter of the criminal history, that is a matter that has caused me some difficulties I confess. Certainly the prisoner’s wider criminal history does not entitle him to any particular leniency and that is acknowledged in the submissions. I have had regard to the conviction in 1999 for the offence the subject of an appeal in 2000. I have concluded that the offending with which I am concerned represents offending of a type, by reference to the conviction for manufacturing methylamphetamine, that would render that conviction an aggravating factor as such. However, again the strength of that aggravating factor may vary in each case. Here it is not a significant aggravating factor, primarily for the reason advanced by learned Senior Counsel for the prisoner, that it was an offence committed quite some years in reality before the offending with which I am concerned. It does not seem to be directly connected with the offending with which I am concerned. It has to be acknowledged as an aggravating factor given its character, but again in the sentencing exercise it is not to my mind a significant or serious aggravating factor as may be the case from time to time.
	
	
	Picking up on some of the other submissions that were made by learned Senior Counsel for the prisoner, I have already noted acceptance of her categorisation of the offending. I have already acknowledged the submission she made about the steps the prisoner has made in his rehabilitation. I certainly could not conclude of course that he is “rehabilitated.” He is obviously a man at considerable risk. His criminal history suggests this is so as does his past drug dependency suggests that and his past association suggests that. But, I am mindful of the real steps that he has taken and I have taken that matter into account to his credit.
	
	
	In terms of the assessment of the offending by reference to the standard non-parole period, I have concluded that the offending is below the middle range of objective seriousness. I pause for a moment to point out that I am unaware of any decision, even the High Court’s judgment in Muldrock, that has addressed the issue of what Chief Justice Spigelman said in Way about the mid-range or middle range of objective seriousness being not necessarily a narrow band. But in this matter there are a number of features of it that I feel compel me to the conclusion I have reached. I am not saying of course it is at the lowest end of criminality. The prisoner’s role as a middleman makes that clear and the period of time over which the offending occurred makes that clear. It is not a one-off ‘brain snap’ or anything of that type. But it is to be said that the quantity of drug involved is just over the minimum amount required for a commercial quantity to be considered under s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.
	
	
	The prisoner’s role was that of a middleman, himself being a user of the drug. I am mindful of the fact that the prisoner was being directed on occasions as to persons to whom he would supply. That is clearly the case in relation to the last substantial supply. Ultimately, the issue of the standard non-parole period falls to be considered by consideration of the legislation that is in force now.
	
	
	Section 54A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act now provides that for the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the Table to the Division, the taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence is in the middle of the range of seriousness. Furthermore, s 54B(2) of the Act provides that the standard non parole period is a matter to be taken into account by the Court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender. Of course, in that regard, as many commentators have noted, including Mr Donnelly for the Judicial Commission and of course judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the new provisions reflect in effect the practical effect of the decision of Muldrock v The Queen, even where an offence does fall within the middle range of objective seriousness. If the Court, for example, makes a finding of special circumstances and then takes into account other matters in mitigation that may arise, could require the Court to settle upon a non-parole period that may be below or well below that identified as the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	In that regard I have taken into account what the High Court said in the decision of Muldrock (2011) 244 CLR 120 and particularly the Court’s conclusion in that matter that in fixing the non-parole period in a case involving a standard non parole period, the standard non-parole period is one part of the larger part of the process of passing sentence. The Court is required to exercise a discretion to sentence consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in the earlier decision of Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357.  The Court is required to identify all relevant factors including those at common law to determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed. I generally refer to in the majority decision of Muldrock in the passages, at [20]-[30]. The Court is not required to attribute particular mathematical value to matters regarded as significant to the formation of the sentence that differs from the standard non parole period. It provides the Court with a guidepost, but many matters are to be taken into account and many of them to which I have already referred.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept, amongst other things, that the prisoner’s plea of guilty is an indication of contrition on his part. I believe that also the evidence available as to the steps that he has taken in his rehabilitation reflects some contrition on his part and the taking of responsibility by him of his conduct. He has, it is clear on the evidence, over an extended period of time sought to change at least, if not undo, the effect of the past conduct to which he admits. In sentencing the offender I have had regard to the general material that has been provided in submissions about comparative sentencing. I have had regard to sentences I have imposed in other cases in relation to offences involving the same provisions. One such judgment is Cheng Lim and Yong Tan, a decision that is not in the database but which I gave on 9 May 2013.
	
	
	I have also had regard to decisions that I have been required to consider in the context of dealing with that and other matters including decisions such as the decision in R v Buttrose [2011] NSWCCA, particularly those passages in the judgment between [40] and [46]. Is it to be fairly said, of course, that the judgments there cited in that judgment in Buttrose itself are concerned with a large commercial quantity which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a greater standard non-parole period. It is by reference, for example, to matters of quantity to be seen that the quantity of prohibited drug with which I am concerned is considerably outweighed or overwhelmed by the quantities that were the subject of discussion in that particular judgment.
	
	
	Other judgments that might be considered are cases of Lui, Huyn, Sciberras, Chen, Lawson and others that I have cited in the judgments of Lim and Tan to which I earlier referred.
	
	
	Learned Senior Counsel for the prisoner did refer to one particular judgment, conceding given the personal circumstances of that offender, there were considerable distinctions between that offending and this, also noting that it was a Crown appeal that was dismissed in exercise of discretion. That certainly underlines the obvious matter in this case that, notwithstanding s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, a full term custody order must be made.
	
	
	One other decision I might mention in passing, again involving sentencing of an offender for committing an offence contrary to s 25(2), is a judgment I gave on 29 November 2012 in the sentencing of Christian Cuzman and George Bucataru. I hasten to say that the sentence I am imposing on the prisoner is less than imposed upon Mr Cuzman and Mr Bucataru or Mr Lim and Mr Tan.
	
	
	The sentences I imposed there, which as I understand it have not been the subject of appeal, involved sentences for offending far more serious than that with which I am concerned here. In both cases they were principals in significant supply of heroin or other prohibited drugs covered by the legislation. In the case of Lim and Tan two offenders although charged under State law very very close to the circumstances of importation who would, as would Mr Cuzman and Mr Bucataru, profit far more than this offender would appear to have profited.
	
	
	I have had regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, as I must. This offending is serious offending, as the Crown pointed out. There is a need for both personal and general deterrence. I do not believe that the community requires protection from the offender. I have to make him accountable. I have to denounce his conduct and recognise any harm that may have been done by the supply of these drugs, although I do note, as I said earlier, he was not supplying to novices or ingénues but what I would understand people well entrenched in the drug usage scene and it may well be of course, given the provision of eight balls and the like, that people to whom he supplied themselves were going to supply to others. I do not find that as an aggravation against the prisoner. It is the fact that he was dealing with experienced drug users. But I am also here to try and promote his rehabilitation.
	
	
	With regard to the aggravating, mitigating and other factors, I have referred to the relevant aggravating factors and I do note that the Court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factors in sentencing if it is an element of the offence and particularly s 21A(5) that any such aggravating or mitigating factor that is relevant and known to the Court does not require the Court to increase or reduce the sentence of the offence.
	
	
	If I may turn to the mitigating factors; I could not conclude, without other evidence, that any injury, loss or damage was substantial. On the other hand, given what I have said about planning and organisation, I could not find on balance that the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity. Of course, the prisoner cannot get the benefit of the mitigating factor that he has prior good character or does not have a record of previous convictions. I cannot conclude without the aid of a crystal ball that he is unlikely to re-offend. But I have determined, ultimately, that he does have good prospects of rehabilitation in the context of his age and of course the matters to which I have earlier referred. I have concluded that he has exhibited remorse through his plea and his actions although he has not given evidence.
	
	
	His plea of guilty is a mitigating factor, of course. I have taken that into account to accord him a discreet discount. I have taken into account everything else that has been put to me by his counsel, most of those matters I adverted to either directly or indirectly in the earlier observations that I have made.
	
	
	The truth of the matter is that, by reference to the maximum penalty and any guidance the standard non-parole period gives, that the offending with which I am concerned is substantial offending. I bear in mind, of course, that the offender since he committed this offence has been dealt with with terms of imprisonment in relation to offending for which he was in part on bail at the time of the commission of these offences.
	
	
	Thus, it has been determined by me in relation to the indictable matter that the appropriate starting sentence, all relevant matters taken into account before any relevant discount, is six years imprisonment. I have accorded the prisoner the 15% discount that I have identified. I have made a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	I have concluded, having rounded down I must say the head sentence from 61 and a half months to 61 months, five years and one month, that the appropriate non-parole period reflecting special circumstances should be as I have earlier identified.  
	
	
	Could you stand up, thanks very much, sir. In relation to the offence on the indictment you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of two year four months. That term of imprisonment shall date from 21 January 2014 and will expire on 11 May 2016. The balance of sentence in relation to that sentence I have imposed will be two years and nine months and that will expire on 11 February 2019. You can take a seat.
	
	
	In relation to the related offence you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months. Because that offending is intimately connected to the offending for sentence in relation to the matter on the indictment, I propose to impose a term of imprisonment that is wholly concurrent with the principal sentence. That term of 12 months imprisonment will date from 12 January 2014 and expire on 11 January 2015.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Any other matters from you, Mr Crown?
	
	
	BOWERS: No, thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You understand the sentence that’s been imposed? You’re eligible for release to parole on 11 May 2016, it’ll be a matter for the Parole Authority as you probably know. But the issue is, as you know from your past experience, how you go in custody will determine that matter. I’m appreciative of the past experiences that you’re going to have to perhaps confront again but I have got no control over the management of the prison system.  But I can only wish you well on your release so that we do not have to see you back in court again.

		13 November 2015",2014-07-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764351,Director General NSW Department of Industry and Investment v Mato Investments Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCCA 132,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: These are proceedings brought to this Court by way of a Stated Case under s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The proceedings arise from a finding of not guilty of the respondents, Mato Investments Pty Ltd (Mato) and Dzeladin Ceman (Mr Ceman) of certain charges alleging offences against the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) (the EPA Act) and the Fisheries Management Act 1994 (NSW) (the Fisheries Act).

 

2The charges all relate to the removal of ""snags"" and large woody debris from the beds and banks of the Murray River and two of its anabranches, namely an anabranch referred to as the ""Big River Billabong"" and an anabranch referred to as the ""Unnamed Creek"" (collectively ""the subject waterways"") during the offences period particularised in each charge (the charges).

 

3The charges against each of the respondents under the Fisheries Act made the following allegations:

 

""(a) that he/it did by an act or omission cause damage to habitat (other than critical habitat) of a threatened ecological community knowing that the area concerned was habitat of that kind, namely an endangered ecological community listed in Part 3 of Schedule 4 to the FM Act and described as the ""Aquatic ecological community in the natural drainage system of the lower Murray River catchment (as described in the recommendation of the Fisheries Scientific Committee to list the ecological community)' (the 'Lower Murray EEC'); and

 

(b) that he/it did by an act or omission cause damage to any habitat (other than critical habitat) of a threatened species of fish, knowing that the area concerned was habitat of that kind, namely an endangered species of fish listed under Part 1 of Schedule 4 to the FM Act, known as the trout cod; and

 

(c) that he/it did by an act or omission cause damage to any habitat (other than critical habitat) of a threatened species of fish, knowing that the area concerned was habitat of that kind, namely a vulnerable species of fish listed under Part 1 of Schedule 4 to the FM Act, known as the sliver perch.""

 

4The charge under the EPA Act alleged an offence against s 125(1) of the EPA Act by reason of a contravention of s 76A(1)(b) of that act in carrying out a development contrary to a development consent which was then in force.

 

The questions raised by the Stated Case

 

5The questions asked by the primary judge in the Stated Case were as follows:

 

""1. On the facts as found, was it open to me to find that there was no development consent 'in force' with respect to the subject land during the charge period within the meaning of s 76A(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979?

 

2. Did I err in finding that I could not consider whether the element of knowledge for the purposes of s 220ZD(1) of the Fisheries Management Act 1994 was to be conclusively presumed by application of s 220ZD(2)(a) of that Act?

 

3. On the facts as found, was I required to conclusively presume that each of Mato Investments Pty Ltd and Dzeladin Ceman knew that the land concerned was the habitat of the trout cod, silver perch and the Lower Murray EEC by reason of the operation of s 220ZD(2) of the Fisheries Management Act 1994 either pursuant to paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of that provision?""

 

The relevant legislation

 

6The following provisions of the EPA Act, the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000 (NSW) (the Regulation) and of the Fisheries Act are relevant to an understanding of the issues raised by the Stated Case:

 

(a) The EPA Act and Regulation

 

7Section 76A(1) of the EPA Act is in the following terms:

 

""76A Development that needs consent

 

(1) GeneralIf an environmental planning instrument provides that specified development may not be carried out except with development consent, a person must not carry the development out on land to which the provision applies unless: 

 

(a) such a consent has been obtained and is in force, and

 

(b) the development is carried out in accordance with the consent and the instrument.""

 

8Division 2 of Pt 4 of the EPA Act sets out the steps to be taken to obtain development consent when it is required. Section 78A provides for the making of an application for development consent whilst ss 79-79C provide for the procedures to be adopted by the consent authority in considering whether to grant consent.

 

9Section 80 of the EPA Act deals with the determination of an application for development consent. So far as relevant it provides as follows:

 

""80 Determination

 

(1) GeneralA consent authority is to determine a development application by: 

 

(a) granting consent to the application, either unconditionally or subject to conditions, or

 

(b) refusing consent to the application.

 

(2) Despite subsection (1), the consent authority must refuse an application for development, being the subdivision of land, that would, if carried out, result in a contravention of this Act, an environmental planning instrument or the regulations, whether arising in relation to that or any other development.

 

(3) 'Deferred commencement' consentA development consent may be granted subject to a condition that the consent is not to operate until the applicant satisfies the consent authority, in accordance with the regulations, as to any matter specified in the condition. Nothing in this Act prevents a person from doing such things as may be necessary to comply with the condition.""

 

10Section 81 of the EPA Act provides for the notification of the grant of consent. It is in the following terms:

 

""81 Post-determination notification

 

(1) The consent authority must, in accordance with the regulations, notify its determination of a development application to: 

 

(a) the applicant, and

 

(b) in the case of a development application for consent to carry out designated development, each person who made a submission under section 79 (5), and

 

(c) such other persons as are required by the regulations to be notified of the determination of the development application.

 

(2) If the consent authority is not the council, the consent authority must notify the council of its determination.

 

(3) In the case of a development application for consent to carry out designated development, the consent authority must also notify each person who made a submission under section 79 (5) by way of objection of the person's rights to appeal against the determination and of the applicant's rights to appeal against the determination.""

 

11Section 83 of the EPA Act provides for the date from which consent operates. Sections 83(1) and 83(2) are in the following terms:

 

""83 Date from which consent operates

 

(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), if a determination is made by the granting of consent, the consent becomes effective and operates from: 

 

(a) except as provided in paragraph (b)-the date that is endorsed on the notice given to the applicant in accordance with section 81 (1) of the determination of the development application or under section 82D(4), or

 

(b) in the case of designated development to which an objection has been made in accordance with section 79 (5): 

 

(i) if consent was granted under section 80 (6) or (7) following the holding of a review that includes a public hearing by the Planning Assessment Commission-the date that is endorsed on the notice of the determination of the development application given to the applicant in accordance with section 81 (1), or

 

(ii) in any other case-the expiration of 28 days from the date that is endorsed on the notice of the determination of the development application given to the applicant in accordance with section 81 (1).

 

(2) Subject to subsection (3), if a determination is made by the granting of consent or the granting of consent subject to conditions, and an appeal has been made under section 97(1) or 98, the consent:

 

(a) ceases to be, or does not become, effective pursuant to subsection (1), and

 

(b) becomes effective and operates from the date of the determination of that appeal, except where that decision is to refuse development consent.""

 

12Section 82A of the EPA Act provides that, subject to certain exceptions when the consent authority is a Council, an applicant may request a review of the decision. Section 97 provides for a right of appeal against the determination of the consent authority within 6 months after notice has been received in accordance with the Regulation, or it is determined in accordance with the time specified in the Regulation that the consent authority has refused consent.

 

13Clause 100 of the Regulation, made under the EPA Act, provides for the form of notification of the consent. Subclauses 100(1) and 100(4) of the Regulation are relevant for the purpose of the proceedings. They are in the following terms:

 

""100(1) For the purposes of section 81 (1) of the Act, a notice of the determination of a development application must contain the following information: 

 

(a) whether the application has been granted or refused,

 

(b) if the application has been granted, the terms of any conditions (including conditions prescribed under section 80A (11) of the Act) on which it has been granted,

 

(c) if the application has been refused, or granted subject to conditions (other than conditions prescribed under section 80A (11) of the Act), the consent authority's reasons for the refusal or for the imposition of those conditions,

 

(c1) whether the applicant has the right to request a review of the determination under section 82A of the Act,

 

...

 

(d) the date on which the determination was made,

 

(e) the date from which any development consent that is granted operates,

 

...

 

(4) In the case of a development consent granted subject to a condition that the consent is not to operate until the applicant satisfies the consent authority, or a person specified by the consent authority, as to any matter specified in the condition: 

 

(a) the date from which the consent operates must not be endorsed on the notice of determination, and

 

(b) if the applicant satisfies the consent authority, or person, as to the matter, the consent authority must give notice to the applicant of the date from which the consent operates.""

 

14Clause 102 of the Regulation provides for notification of the determination of consent of an application for development consent to be sent to those persons entitled to receive it within 14 days of the date of determination. The Regulation requires that for the purposes of s 81(1)(c) of the EPA Act any person who has made a submission in respect of the application for development consent is required to be notified.

 

15Section 101 of the EPA Act provides as follows:

 

""101 Validity of development consents and complying development certificates

 

If public notice of the granting of a consent or a complying development certificate is given in accordance with the regulations by a consent authority or an accredited certifier, the validity of the consent or certificate cannot be questioned in any legal proceedings except those commenced in the Court by any person at any time before the expiration of 3 months from the date on which public notice was so given.""

 

(b) The Fisheries Act

 

16Section 220ZD of the Fisheries Act is in the following terms:

 

""220ZD Damage to habitat of threatened species, population or ecological community

 

(1) A person must not, by an act or omission, do anything that causes damage to any habitat (other than critical habitat) of a threatened species, population or ecological community if the person knows that the area concerned is habitat of that kind. 

 

Maximum penalty: 1,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 1 year, or both.

 

(2) In proceedings for an offence under this section in respect of an act or an omission of a person that causes damage to any habitat (other than critical habitat) of a threatened species, population or ecological community, it is to be conclusively presumed that the person knew that the land concerned was habitat of that kind if it is established that: 

 

(a) the act or omission occurred in the course of the carrying out of development or an activity for which development consent under Part 4 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979, or an approval to which Part 5 of that Act applies, was required but not obtained, or

 

(b) the act or omission constituted a failure to comply with any such development consent or approval.""

 

The Stated Case

 

(a) Factual findings

 

17The Stated Case records the following factual findings made by the primary judge:

 

(a)Mato was a proprietor of a rural property known as Kunanadgee, on the bank of the Murray River on which it was constructing an Eco Tourist Resort (the Resort) pursuant to a development consent granted by the Corowa Shire Council (the Council).

 

(b)Mr Ceman was one of the directors of Mato.

 

(c)The subject waterways formed part of the habitat of a threatened ecological community within the meaning of the Fisheries Act, namely the Lower Murray EEC, and part of the habitat of trout cod and silver perch, each of which are threatened species of fish within the meaning of the Fisheries Act.

 

(d)Development consent for the Resort was granted by the Council on 29 May 2007 (the Consent). Condition 16 of the Consent was in the following terms:

 

""No snags (large woody debris on the bank or in the water) are to be moved, relocated or removed either at the time of construction or in the future without consultation with DPI.""

 

(e)Mr Michael Hanger was engaged by Mato to carry out clean-up works at Kunanadgee.

 

(f)On 3 August 2007 there was a meeting of the shareholders of Mato attended by Mr Ceman. A Mr Smit advised he had spoken to a colleague who was available to clear up the site around the Murray River and creek areas.

 

(g)At some time prior to 16 August 2007 Mr Hanger attended a meeting at the Kunanadgee site with Mr Smit and Mr Ceman to discuss the work to be carried out by him. Mr Ceman told Mr Hanger to clean up deadwood along the top of the banks of the Murray River and around the Unnamed Creek. He instructed Mr Hanger to remove trees from the Unnamed Creek but did not tell him to remove or not remove snags from the Murray River.

 

(h)On 16 August 2007 Mr Hanger attended the office of Mr Coomes, an independent town planning consultant employed by Mato. Mr Hanger said he had been onsite with Mr Smit and Mr Ceman and he had a list of tasks that Mr Smit had asked Mr Coomes to type up. Mr Coomes typed up a scope of work document which included the provision ""Remove any major dead trees in the river, subject to being able to do so"".

 

(i)The scope of works document was emailed to Mr Smit by Mr Coomes who told Mr Smit that removal of trees from the river was not in accordance with the Consent.

 

(j)From 5-16 October 2007 a very large quantity of woody debris was removed from the subject waterways. The removal of the debris caused danger to the habitats of the trout cod, the silver perch and the Lower Murray EEC.

 

18The Stated Case says that by reason of the instructions conveyed by Mr Ceman to Mr Hanger on 16 August 2007 the primary judge was satisfied that Mr Ceman caused the damage to the habitats of ""the trout cod, the silver perch or [sic] the Lower Murray EEC"" by the removal of snags and large woody debris from the Unnamed Creek. However, the primary judge was not satisfied Mr Ceman caused the damage to their habitat occasioned by the removal of snags and large woody debris from the Murray River or the Big River Billabong. The Stated Case also records the primary judge finding that Mato was liable for Mr Ceman's actions in causing Mr Hanger to clear snags from the Unnamed Creek.

 

(b) Findings as to whether there was a development consent in force

 

19The conclusion of the primary judge on this issue is the subject of Question 1 of the Stated Case.

 

20The Stated Case records that there were two notices of determination of the granting of Consent, in different terms, both dated 30 May 2007. The first of the notices was signed by the General Manager of the Council, Mr Corcoran (the Corcoran Notice). It reflected the Council's resolution approving the development and contained 65 conditions including Condition 16 (referred to at par [17](d) above).

 

21The other notice was signed by Mr Bobby Parr, the Council's Director of Environmental Services on behalf of the General Manager (the Parr Notice). The Parr Notice contained the 65 conditions in the Corcoran Notice but unlike the Corcoran Notice, identified conditions 3 and 4 as deferred commencement conditions. The Parr Notice is an annexure to the Stated Case and so far as relevant was in the following terms:

 

""DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION NO. 2007/56NOTICE OF DETERMINATION OF DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION issued under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 Section 81(1)(a)

 

...

 

Determination: Consent granted subject to conditions described below.

 

Consent to Operate from: 30 MAY 2007

Consent to Lapse on: 30 MAY 2012

 

'DEFERRED COMMENCEMENT' - This development consent is not to operate until ITEMS 3 AND 4 of the CONDITIONS have been complied with to Council satisfaction.

 

CONDITIONS

 

...

 

3. Prior to the issue of a construction certificate and/or commencement of any works including design, building and engineering works, the applicant is to submit to Council documentation from Department of Natural Resources that approval has been granted for the existing Water Access Licence to be subdivided and a portion (9 ML) converted to High Security.

 

4. Prior to the issue of a construction certificate and/or commencement of any works including design, building and engineering works, the applicant is to submit to Council documentation from Country Energy and Telstra certifying the availability and provision of electricity and telecommunication services to the site for the purpose of eco-tourism and associated infrastructure usage.

 

...

 

16. No snags (large woody debris on the bank or in the water) are to be moved, relocated or removed either at the time of construction or in the future without consultation with DPL.""

 

22The Stated Case says that Mr Parr signed the Parr Notice after changing the terms of the Consent to impose the deferred commencement conditions, something which his delegated authority did not permit him to do.

 

23The Stated Case also says that the primary judge found that the Parr Notice was sent to Mr Bennett, a director of Mato, shortly after 30 May 2007 and also to the government authorities required to be notified under s 81(1)(c) of the EPA Act on 22 October 2007. It records that Mr Bennett believed that the Consent was subject to the deferred commencement conditions and that he acted accordingly. The primary judge found that the Parr Notice was issued in purported but unsuccessful compliance with s 81(1).

 

24The Stated Case records the primary judge was satisfied that the Corcoran Notice was not the version of consent notified under s 81(1) of the EPA Act to Mr Bennett.

 

25The Stated Case also records the conclusion of the primary judge that although a commencement date was endorsed on the Parr Notice, this was not done in accordance with the notification under s 81(1) of the EPA Act and the time for commencement of a deferred consent contained in s 80(3). Further being a deferred commencement consent, it could not and did not commence on 30 May 2007.

 

26The Stated Case records that the primary judge concluded that the actual determination of the consent authority is distinct from the notification of the determination of the consent authority under s 81(1) of the EPA Act and where the s 81 notice does not reflect the Council's decision then the notice is invalid so the consent does not become operational for the purpose of s 83(1).

 

27The Stated Case records the conclusion of the primary judge that there was no development consent in force during the period and there was therefore no breach of Condition 16.

 

(c) Presumption of knowledge under s 220ZD(2)(a) of the Fisheries Act

 

28This is the subject of Question 2 of the Stated Case.

 

29The Stated Case records that the case, as particularised in the summons, was that knowledge of the contravention was conclusively presumed by virtue of s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act by reason of the fact that the act of removing the snags and woody debris from the subject waterways constituted a contravention of Condition 16 of the Consent. The Stated Case also noted that that was the manner the prosecutor conducted the case up to the time of closing address.

 

30The Stated Case records the conclusion of the primary judge that having regard to the finding that there was no development consent in force, the presumption in s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act could not apply.

 

31The Stated Case records that the primary judge refused to allow the prosecutor to rely on s 220ZD(2)(a) of the Fisheries Act as an alternative as she did not consider she could make all the relevant findings pertinent to that issue as all matters relevant to it were not canvassed before her.

 

(d) Whether s 220ZD(2)(a) or (b) of the Fisheries Act apply in any event

 

32This was the subject of Question 3.

 

33The Stated Case notes the prosecutor's submission that for the purpose of s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act it was unnecessary to establish that the Consent was in force in the sense of any deferred commencement condition having been satisfied.

 

34The Stated Case records that the primary judge concluded that this was not the case particularised and, further, for the purpose of s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act if a development consent is not in force, regardless of whether it has been obtained, there cannot be a failure to comply with such a consent.

 

The parties' submissions

 

(a) Question 1

 

35The appellant submitted that neither of the two decisions relied on by her Honour, Pselletes v Randwick City Council [2009] NSWCA 262; (2009) 77 NSWLR 287 (Pselletes) and Hopkins v Tweed Shire Council [2001] NSWLEC 75; (2001) 113 LGERA 406 (Hopkins), compelled the conclusion which she reached.

 

36The appellant submitted that the primary judge misunderstood the relevant facts in Hopkins. He submitted that the notice in that case was not found invalid ""because a prohibited development was notified"", but rather because the notice which purported to notify a permissible development (earthworks) was inconsistent with the determination of the Council which had resolved to consent to a prohibited development (extractive industry).

 

37The appellant accepted that it is the determination of the consent authority under s 80(1)(a) of the EPA Act which constitutes the development consent rather than the notice issued pursuant to s 81(1). The appellant, however, did not accept that either Pselletes or Hopkins were authority for the proposition that any inconsistency between the terms of a development consent and the notice of that consent led to the consent not becoming operative. The appellant pointed to the fact that in Pselletes (at 48) Tobias JA said that consequence may occur. The appellant submitted that the answer to that question would depend upon whether the legislative intention was to invalidate any notice which failed to accurately record the terms of the development consent in question: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 (Project Blue Sky) at 388-389.

 

38The appellant submitted that the conditions described as deferred commencement conditions in the Parr Notice were conditions imposed by Council and whilst not deferred commencement conditions as a ""term of art"" under s 80(3) of the EPA Act in practice they would need to be fulfilled prior to any other work being carried out. The appellant also pointed to the fact that the Parr Notice, consistent with the Council resolution, stated the Consent was to operate from 30 May 2007.

 

39The appellant submitted that the primary judge erred in failing to consider the significance of the inconsistency between the Consent and the Parr Notice and whether the legislative intention to be discerned was that an inconsistency of that nature would lead to the invalidity of the Parr Notice. Counsel for the appellant emphasised that the conditions in question were conditions imposed by Council albeit not as deferred commencement conditions.

 

40Counsel for the appellant submitted that the purpose of notification was to balance the rights conferred on the beneficiary of the consent against the capacity of the decision-maker to continue to consider its position as if it had not already committed itself.

 

41The appellant also submitted that s 101 of the EPA Act prohibited the primary judge from making a finding that the Parr Notice was invalid.

 

42The respondents submitted that it was not necessary to determine the extent of the authority of Hopkins and Pselletes because, contrary to the appellant's submissions, the inconsistency between the Consent and the Parr Notice was neither minor nor trivial. He submitted that the primary judge correctly found that the inconsistency between the Consent and the Parr Notice was of substance.

 

43Counsel for the respondents submitted that irrespective of the practical effect of the deferred commencement conditions on the development there was a legal consequence, namely exposure to prosecution for carrying out an activity not in conformity with the deferred consent. He pointed out that s 76A(1)(a) of the EPA Act required the consent to both be obtained and to be in force.

 

44Counsel for the respondents also pointed to the fact that the use of the word ""must"" in s 81(1) of the EPA Act and the requirement to notify persons who had made a submission in respect of a designated development under s 79(5) and of their rights of appeal, supported the proposition that strict compliance with s 81(1) was required.

 

45The respondents submitted that whilst s 101 of the EPA Act may have prevented a challenge to the validity of the Consent, what was in issue in the present case was the validity of the Parr Notice and whether the Consent was actually in force. They submitted that s 101 would not be interpreted so broadly as to prevent a collateral challenge to whether the Consent was in force. They also submitted that compliance with s 81(1) and s 83(1) was indispensable so as not to be covered by the privative provision.

 

(b) Question 2

 

46The appellant contended that her Honour erred in declining to consider whether s 220ZD(2)(a) of the Fisheries Act applied in the particular circumstances of the case. He submitted that in reaching that conclusion her Honour misunderstood the function of particulars.

 

47The appellant submitted that what the prosecution is required to establish is the essential elements of the offences charged, not the particulars. He accepted that there may be some cases arising from the nature of the evidence or the manner in which the proceedings were conducted which would make it unfair for a prosecutor to depart from the particulars but said that this was not the present case.

 

48The appellant submitted that no injustice arose from the present case as the alternatives in s 220ZD(2)(a) and s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act cover the field where the actions in question were carried out in the course of a development which required development consent. He submitted that any additional submissions that the work did not constitute ""development"" or that the ""development"" was not prohibited could have been accommodated.

 

49The appellant submitted that the task of the primary judge was to consider whether, on the evidence, knowledge in the relevant sense was required to be conclusively presumed by virtue of the operation of s 220ZD(2) of the Fisheries Act. It was submitted that if the primary judge considered the issue had not been sufficiently addressed it was open to her to invite further submissions.

 

50In support of the proposition that either s 220ZD(2)(a) or s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act applied, counsel for the appellant pointed to the finding by the primary judge that there was a development which required consent under the EPA Act. He submitted that it was not necessary to establish for the purpose of s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act that the person concerned knew that the act or omission constituted a breach of the development consent.

 

51Counsel for the appellant emphasised that it was always incumbent on the prosecution to prove that the acts complained of were carried out in the course of a development which required consent. He submitted the respondents were aware of this and could not complain if once that was proven the case fell within either of the two subsections of s 220ZD(2) of the Fisheries Act.

 

52The respondents emphasised that the primary judge precluded the prosecutor from relying on s 220ZD(2)(a) of the Fisheries Act on the basis of unfairness as it constituted a change in what had been addressed by both parties up to the time of final address.

 

53The respondents emphasised that Mr Ceman was only found to have caused the removal of some of the snags in the Unnamed Creek and that he was not involved in the preparation of the scope of work document that brought about the large-scale removal. They submitted that in those circumstances it may have been open for the respondents to argue that their conduct was consistent with agricultural clean-up of the property which would not have required consent or approval under the EPA Act.

 

54The respondents also pointed to the different wording of subs (a) and (b) of s 220ZD(2) of the Fisheries Act. They submitted that it would have been open for them to argue that for s 220ZD(2)(a) to be engaged it was necessary to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the requirement for consent or approval.

 

55Counsel for the respondents pointed to the factual findings set out in the Stated Case (to which I have referred in par [17](f), (g) and (h) above) and submitted that all that was contemplated at that stage was a clean-up of the property and to the fact that Mr Ceman was not responsible for the clean-up of areas other than the Unnamed Creek (see par [18] above). Counsel for the respondents pointed out by reference to an argument raised by a co-defendant, a Mr Coomes, that had s 220ZD(2)(a) of the Fisheries Act been in issue it would have been open to the defendants to argue that nothing had occurred in the course of carrying out a development for which development consent was required. He submitted the same position would apply to his clients including Mato, as it was only liable as a result of the acts of Mr Ceman being attributed to it.

 

(c) Question 3

 

56The appellant repeated his submissions that either a development consent was not obtained, in which case s 220ZD(2)(a) of the Fisheries Act applied, or the work was not carried out in accordance with the Consent in which case s 220ZD(2)(b) applied. He submitted that if the basis on which it was said that s 220ZD(2)(a) did not apply was that development consent had been obtained then s 220ZD(2)(b) applied irrespective of whether or not the Consent was in force.

 

57The respondents submitted that it was implicit in the words in s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act, ""a failure to comply with any such development consent or approval"", that a consent was in force.

 

Consideration

 

(a) Question 1

 

58The issue raised by Question 1 is whether a notice given under s 81(1) of the EPA Act must reflect strictly the requirements of the Regulation for a development consent to become effective by virtue of s 83(1). Put another way, does the legislative intention manifested by s 81(1) require strict compliance with its requirements before the consent becomes effective and operative?

 

59The question depends on the opening words of s 81(1) of the EPA Act, ""The consent authority must, in accordance with the regulations, notify its determination of a development application"".

 

60The task of construing the section must begin with a consideration of the text itself taking into account the context including the general purpose and policy of the provision: Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue (Northern Territory) [2009] HCA 41; (2009) 239 CLR 27 at [47]. Context is important as statutory construction requires deciding what is the legal meaning of a provision by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole: Certain Lloyd's Underwriters v Cross [2012] HCA 56; (2012) 248 CLR 378 at [23]-[24], [69] and [88] and Project Blue Sky at [69].

 

61The fact that the word ""must"" is used in the opening words of s 81(1) of the EPA Act is relevant but not conclusive of the construction of the section. In considering the issue it is necessary to consider whether the legislative intention, having regard to the language used in context and the scope and object of the statute, requires strict compliance with the section before a development consent becomes effective: Project Blue Sky at [93].

 

62In my opinion, a consideration of the context of the provision and its purpose in the legislative scheme leads to the conclusion that the notice of development consent must at least state accurately the critical matters required to be notified by the Regulation. This includes in particular, as in the present case, the conditions upon which the development consent has been granted. This is for the following reasons.

 

63First, although not conclusive, the use of the words ""must, in accordance with the regulations"" suggests that strict compliance is required for the notice to be effective.

 

64Second, the notice operates as a pre-condition to the consent being operative: EPA Act, s 83(1). The fact that it operates in this way as distinct from merely informing the appellant of the decision of the consent authority also suggests that strict compliance is required.

 

65Third, and importantly, the notice is required to be given to any person who has made submissions in respect of the development and the time for any appeal is set by reference to the date of the notice. In those circumstances, strict compliance with the form of the notice generally is required: Scurr v Brisbane City Council [1973] HCA 39; (1973) 133 CLR 242 at 255 and D C Pearce and R S Geedes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, (7th ed, 2011 LexisNexis Butterworths), 11.124.

 

66The conclusion which I have reached is consistent with authority. In Shanahan v Strathfield Municipal Council (1973) 2 NSWLR 740, Street CJ in Eq in dealing with the equivalent sections of the Local Government Act 1919 (NSW) stated that a mere informal notification of a decision is not sufficient to make it effective but rather that formal notification is required.

 

67In Pselletes the council consented to a development application which did not include approval for a proposed balcony, the application so far as it included the balcony having been withdrawn. The notice given under s 81 of the EPA Act included the balcony as part of the approved development. The question in that case was whether it was the actual resolution of Council or the notification which constituted consent. The Court held that it was the former. In the course of his judgment Tobias JA, with whom Ipp JA and Sackville AJA agreed, made the following remarks at [44]:

 

""[44] However, in my view there are authorities to the contrary of the proposition advanced by the appellants in Stebbins, which establish that the development consent is the actual determination of the relevant consent authority under s 80(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act which should be regarded as quite distinct from the notification of that determination under s 81. Thus in Hopkins v Tweed Shire Council (2001) 113 LGERA 406 at 410 [26], Talbot J accepted the submission that the council's decision (granting development consent) was its resolution represented in written form by a council minute. Where, however, the s 81 notice does not correctly reflect the council's decision as so represented, then that notice is invalid as a consequence whereof the consent does not become operative for the purpose of s 83(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act.""

 

68Although his Honour said subsequently in his judgment at [48] that such consequences may arise, the view he expressed at [44] is consistent with what in my opinion is the correct construction of the section.

 

69One matter required to be notified by the Regulation is the terms of any conditions: clause 100(1)(b). The Parr Notice misstated the terms in stating two of the conditions were deferred commencement conditions. It follows in my view that the Parr Notice was not effective to make the Consent operative within the meaning of s 83(1) of the EPA Act.

 

70It was submitted that in the present case the fact that the conditions in question were described as deferred commencement conditions would not practically affect the manner in which the development was carried out. That may be so but that ignores the legal consequences. If the conditions were not met prior to any other work being carried out the developer would be guilty of an offence. This would be contrary to the conditions imposed by Council.

 

71The appellant's reliance on s 101 of the EPA Act can be dealt with shortly. Section 101 prevents a challenge to a consent in any legal proceedings commenced before 3 months after public notice of the consent. In the present case the Consent is not challenged. The respondents' case was it did not become effective because of non-compliance with the notice requirements of s 81(1). Section 101 has no application in these circumstances.

 

72It follows that Question 1 in the Stated Case should be answered in the affirmative.

 

(b) Question 2

 

73It is clear from the particulars of the acts and omissions of the defendants contained in the summonses, that the contravention of Condition 16 of the Consent was relied upon to establish presumed knowledge by virtue of s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act. That was not disputed by the appellant. Further, it was not in dispute that this was the basis upon which the appellant conducted his case up to the time of closing addresses.

 

74As the respondents pointed out in their submissions, the factual question as to whether the removal of the debris from the Unnamed Creek occurred in the course of a development was not in issue in the way the case was conducted. Had reliance been placed on s 220ZD(2)(a) of the Fisheries Act it may have been possible for evidence to be led and submissions made on the issue of whether or not development consent was in fact required for the purpose of removing debris from the Unnamed Creek as distinct from the balance of the work which was carried out.

 

75The appellant accepted correctly that there may be occasions when it would be unfair and oppressive to permit the prosecutor to depart from the particulars in the summons: Environment Protection Authority v Sydney Water Corporation Limited (1997) 98 A Crim R 481 at 484. One area where unfairness occurs is attempting to change particulars at the conclusion of a trial where there is the possibility that additional evidence could have been adduced to rebut the charge as particularised.

 

76As it appears from her judgment, the primary judge considered the amendment raised additional factual matters which had not been considered. In the Stated Case she referred expressly to the submission of Mr Coomes to which I have referred in par [55] above.

 

77The question of allowing the amendment to the particulars was a matter which fell within her Honour's discretion. No error of discretion has been made out.

 

78It follows that this question should be answered in the negative.

 

(c) Question 3

 

79As I indicated in answer to Question 2, the primary judge did not err in her discretion in rejecting the appellant's attempt to rely on s 220ZD(2)(a) of the Fisheries Act. It was argued, however, that even if the Parr Notice did not comply with s 81(1) of the EPA Act, there was a development consent in force so that s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act would operate to presume knowledge.

 

80In my opinion this submission must be rejected. Section 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act refers to ""the act or omission constituted a failure to comply with any such development consent"". The words ""act or omission"" refer back to the opening words of s 220ZD(2), ""an act or omission of a person that causes damage to any habitat"", whilst the words ""failure to comply with any such development consent"" refer back to the wording in s 220ZD(2)(a) ""carrying out of...an activity for which development consent...was required"".

 

81Section 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act is thus designed to deal with a situation where a development consent is in force and damage to the habitat occurs as a result of acts or omission not in compliance with its terms. The subsection assumes that a development consent is in force.

 

82Section 83(1)(a) of the EPA Act makes it clear that the consent only became effective and operative from the date endorsed on the notice given in accordance with s 81(1) of the EPA Act. Until a valid notice is given the consent is not in force and s 220ZD(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act can have no operation. As I have indicated a valid notice was not given in this case.

 

83In those circumstances Question 3 should be answered in the negative.

 

Conclusion

 

84In the result I would order that the questions asked in the Stated Case be answered as follows:

 

Question 1

On the facts as found, was it open to me to find that there was no development consent 'in force' with respect to the subject land during the charge period within the meaning of s 76A(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979?

 

Answer: Yes

 

Question 2Did I err in finding that I could not consider whether the element of knowledge for the purposes of s 220ZD(1) of the Fisheries Management Act 1994 was to be conclusively presumed by application of s 220ZD(2)(a) of that Act?

 

Answer: No

 

Question 3On the facts as found, was I required to conclusively presume that each of Mato Investments Pty Ltd and Dzeladin Ceman knew that the land concerned was the habitat of the trout cod, silver perch and the Lower Murray EEC by reason of the operation of s 220ZD(2) of the Fisheries Management Act 1994 either pursuant to paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of that provision?""

 

Answer: No

 

85FULLERTON J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

 

86BELLEW J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

		20 April 2015",2014-07-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764354,R (Cth) v Tran [2014] NSWDC 197,"sentence

1HIS HONOUR: Ngoc Huong Tran appears today for sentence in relation to an offence to which she pleaded guilty at the Magistrate's Court alleging she, on 29 August 2013 at Mascot imported a substance, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely heroin, and the quantity imported being a marketable quantity contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code. 

2The prisoner continued her plea of guilty in relation to this offence in this Court. The maximum penalty for the offence is twenty-five years imprisonment and/or a fine of $850,000. I have told the prisoner in advance of details of what the sentence will be. It is always my practice, except in matters of sensitive security circumstances, to tell prisoners in advance what the penalty is. 

3The facts in relation to this matter are on one view of it straight forward and simple and it goes without saying in this jurisdiction at least, that is the New South Wales District Court, the Court sees many cases of a similar nature. The prisoner, who is a native of Vietnam and a citizen of Vietnam, had been a resident in Australia since, as I understand it, approximately 2008 or 2009, not as a ""resident"" as such but as an accompanying person to her daughter who is studying in Victoria. She travelled from Australia on this occasion to take part in the importation of heroin. The circumstances of her involving herself in this offence on her account are that she developed what could be called a gambling habit shortly after she arrived in Australia, in part out of isolation and loneliness. She developed gambling debts, which ultimately totalled approximately $18,000. She claimed that people that she knew, associated with these gambling debts in order to forgive the debt, either persuaded her, or perhaps pressured her, into agreeing to travel to Vietnam to bring back substances into Australia.

4The prisoner has not given evidence in this Court. Although I do not reject all the history that has been given by the prisoner, I reject the history given by the prisoner that she did not know that she was bringing heroin back into the country, that she believed that what she was bringing back into the country was something more benign, or less sinister. I understand the point she makes that she ran the risk, if detected in Vietnam, of possession of the heroin that she brought into the country. She faced the possibility of the death penalty there. But it is quite clear that she took the risks that were inherent in committing this crime, as is self-evident by her attempt to bring the drugs into the country, that is Australia, in my view well knowing that there were severe penalties for that crime.

5On 29 August 2013 she arrived in Australia on a Vietnam Airlines flight. She was the subject of attention from Customs Officers, and a narcotic detector dog was able to detect the presence of border controlled drugs on her in the sense that the dog gave a positive reaction to the offender. When asked if she had anything between her legs she said ""No"". Then she removed a black coloured plastic bag concealed within the groin area of her clothing. When asked what it was, after a caution had been administered, she said, ""I don't know"". The black coloured black plastic bag contained 85 blue coloured rubber coated pellets, measuring approximately 3 centimetres in length and 1.5 centimetres in width. I must say, in passing, I have seen a number of cases where in fact similar pellets have been ingested and have been recovered from importers after hospital treatment.

6Concealed within the pellets were approximately 356 grams of white coloured compressed heroin in powder form. A caution was further administered to the prisoner and she removed one white coloured tape package, again concealed within the groin area of her clothing. She again said she did not know what was in it - that is the package - but what was in it were four smaller packages, and concealed within the smaller packages were approximately 394 grams of white coloured compressed heroin in powder form. The material was weighed and the total weight of the material containing heroin was 597.9 grams. Having regard to the average purity of the material that was tested, ranging between 60.1% and 60.39%, the net weight is calculated to be, and not disputed, as 370.9 grams. Under Commonwealth law the prisoner is to be sentenced on the basis that that is relevant quantity.

7The antecedents produced by the Crown are very brief and they state that the prisoner is the mother of two children. I understand from the other material available to me that she is separated from her husband who resides in Vietnam, as does one of her children. The prisoner was not employed at the time of the commission of the offence and apparently had not been employed for some period of time. She held a ""student guardian visa"", which is valid until the end of this month. The antecedents said that the prisoner had no identifiable means of financial, or known social or family support in Australia. I interpose to point out that there is other material from the histories given by the prisoner that she has a male partner who has supported her that lives in Victoria. But he did not give evidence in these proceedings. She also apparently has relatives with whom her daughter currently resides as she continues her studies in Victoria.

8The prisoner had no prior convictions in New South Wales or elsewhere in Australia. I am led to believe that she has no prior convictions in Vietnam. I point out that many people in the position of this prisoner, bringing prohibited drugs into this country in the manner in which these drugs were brought into the country, have no prior criminal convictions. One of the attractions of persons such as this prisoner being recruited for this particular purpose with no prior criminal convictions is the misguided belief that the absence of convictions will mean an absence of official interest.

9I have some evidence from a Federal Agent that the ""street value"" of the heroin is calculated to be - based upon a particular figure supplied in the statement - between $370,900 and $432,717. This is based upon an assumption that street level heroin is sold normally at a purity between 20% to 30%. It seems to me, with respect, noting the calculations that have been used, that the range of value might be somewhat narrow given the variables that are involved. I discussed this with the learned Crown Prosecutor and learned counsel for the prisoner. I appreciate of course the reality is the true street value of the drugs may be less, perhaps substantially less than the minimum amount. This is really a matter of speculation. But I take into account the estimate, bearing in mind of course it is not at odds, nor was it suggested to be at odds, with general figures that are available from time to time in this Court in criminal trials and other sentence matters in relation to the same border controlled drug.

10The wholesale value of the heroin seizure, which seems to me the more reliable figure, and again was not the subject of specific objection, is $169,632, based upon calculations of a value per 350 gram block price. The seizure equates to 1.71 times 350 gram blocks of impure heroin. I have done a number of cases in recent years involving the supply of ""blocks"" of heroin of 350 grams. The calculation seems to accord with evidence that has been given without dispute in other criminal trials. It goes without saying, and it is acknowledged obviously through the submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner, that the heroin brought into the country by the prisoner was of significant value. It certainly is of a value - if sold on - to cover the expenses that were inherent in the recruitment of the prisoner. As I understand the matter her airfare was paid for, although I have no details of whether she was given any living expenses, bearing in mind of course she has family in Vietnam, to which I will refer in a moment. Of course, there is the issue of the $18,000 debt that she claims.

11I have a pre-sentence report from the Department of Corrective Services, Community Corrections Division. It states that the prisoner first travelled to Australia in August 2008 on a guardian visa, according to the history she has given. Her daughter was permitted to continue her education in Melbourne. The daughter is now 17 years. I take it thus that the daughter came to Australia either to start high school, or just before starting high school. The report confirms the presence of an aunt, as she is described, in Victoria, suggesting family connection in that State. The prisoner has a son aged 14 years who resides in Vietnam with the prisoner's ex-husband. Both of her parents, she said, experience ongoing physical health difficulties, and I accept from the evidence available, both the history given by the prisoner, and the contents of exhibit 2, which is a translated summary of medical records that are in the Vietnamese language, that particularly her father has significant health difficulties. I was provided with photographs of him in the care of what I take to be the brother of the prisoner. The father has suffered an aneurism of the right mid brain. He was first treated for that in 2005, and he has what appears from the photographs and the other material, a disability similar to the effect of a severe stroke.

12I accept as a general proposition within the Vietnamese community that a child with a sick parent would feel an obligation to care for and provide for that parent. This is an obligation of course that falls to us in Australia, not of Vietnamese heritage as well. But I also bear in mind in terms of what was said to be the responsibility of the prisoner, that she has six other siblings, five siblings live in Vietnam, one sibling lives in the United States. One of her siblings is in fact the full time carer for her father. She left Vietnam after he suffered the aneurism to come to this country in any event.  

13The prisoner apparently has had no financial means of support for a number of years, beyond perhaps what she may have earned from gambling. Thus, the reality is that the prisoner's father, and her mother for that matter, would appear not realistically to be in any way financially dependent upon her. In fact, there is ample evidence from her own case that there are other people who can take that responsibility on in her absence. 

14It was not submitted, I hasten to say, that the circumstances of her parents, or even her children, created any exceptional, or even special circumstances relevant to the sentencing exercise. But I accept that such responsibility as she may have for her father, such responsibility as she obviously must have for her children, is a relevant matter in this sentencing exercise, but not such as to substantially diminish what would otherwise be the appropriate sentence. It goes without saying, of course, that the prisoner agreed to do what she did in the full knowledge that she had responsibilities for both her parents and her children, but chose to pursue the course that she did.

15The prisoner apparently in Vietnam had little employment, was largely involved in household duties, and I have referred to the history that she gave to the Community Corrections Service of gambling debts. There is of course - and not the subject of particular comment in the submissions of either Crown or defence - the glaring fact, as it might be relevant to the assessment of her gambling difficulties, that in the history she gave to the psychologist, whose report I will refer to in a moment, she claimed that she had actually stopped gambling in 2011. As we know from the facts this offence was committed in August 2013.

16Accepting that she did have the gambling debt, accepting that forgiveness of the gambling debt was a reason for her to commit the offence, I see nothing in her own version of events of any temporal connection between the pressures of the gambling debt and the commission of the offence. On her own version of events there is a gap of almost two years, or perhaps greater than two years, between the cessation of her gambling and her trip to Vietnam.

17Be that as it may, in terms of her attitude to the offending in the report prepared by Community Corrections, I have already noted the fact that she denied that she was smuggling heroin. The report says she ""minimised her culpability for her offending"", and ""externalised blame on unknown persons to whom she was allegedly in debt"".

18She claimed to the Community Corrections Officer that she was ""desperate"", which may be true, but was also ""tricked"" into importing the heroin. She claimed that the substance she concealed was ""Western medicine"". This I have a great deal of difficulty accepting. In fact, in all the circumstances of the matter, cannot accept.

19I do not accept that she would agree, if it be true, to go to Vietnam on this one occasion in forgiveness of an $18,000 debt, simply for the purposes of returning to this country concealing ""Western medicine"" on her person. In any event when one looks at the character of the items that she had apparently hidden within her clothing in her groin area, one might have thought that the character of the containers and the material that was on her person, would not necessarily speak of ""Western medicine"".

20I hasten to say, in fairness that, in the context of clearly dealing with a person who is not perfect  she will, notwithstanding overwhelming evidence to the contrary or in the face of overwhelming evidence, seek to minimise or diminish their responsibility for their actions. This is in many respects a perfectly understandable reaction for a person facing serious consequences. Its relevance in this matter is not to punish her additionally for not being frank about her knowledge of what she is involved in at the time.  But that is the case here.

21She certainly has made no attempt to assist the authorities by providing details of any meaningful character as to the people who recruited her in Australia, or the people with whom she associated in Vietnam who provided her with the heroin, but it is a matter that is relevant to the assessment of her ""contrition"", or her remorseful regret for her involvement in this offence. 

22She certainly is sorry for herself. That is a perfectly human reaction of course. Her plea of 'guilty' does imply, on her part, some contrition and responsibility for her actions. But ultimately it is a matter of little moment on the issue of contrition when she continues to maintain what, in my mind, is an unacceptable account of her knowledge of what she involved herself in.

23She most probably will be the subject of deportation, given the fact that her current visa expires on 31 July 2014, on character grounds arising out of her conviction for this matter. 

24The Community Corrections Officer reiterated in the assessment that it was difficult to elicit salient information regarding historic factors that may have contributed to her offending behaviour. She minimised her responsibility for her offending behaviour. It notes that she maintained that she had not held employment whilst in Australia and was under financial duress, and that she had ""no alternative"" but to engage in offending to repay her debt.

25If this be a serious assertion made on her part in these proceedings, although it was not specifically articulated by her counsel, I cannot accept that as correct. It is noted from material that is not questioned in submission, but is not certified in the report from the Community Corrections that the prisoner had the financial capacity to make 13 return trips to Vietnam since 2010. Her visa requirements stipulate that she must reside with her daughter in Melbourne to continue to be a resident in Australia.

26Now of course I do not draw a conclusion that she has made 13 trips to Vietnam to import drugs into Australia. That would be quite unfair. However, her financial circumstances, as explained to the Community Corrections officer it can fairly said, are in accord with the financial difficulties that she identifies as contributing to her current difficulties. I hasten to say that I am prepared to accept that gambling debts have contributed to her agreement to commit this offence. But I cannot conclude, nor was it reasonably suggested, that she was under form of duress or that she was under form of pressure that effectively compelled her to commit the crime that she has committed. 

27This brings me to the psychological report that was tendered on behalf of the prisoner. This document is based upon material briefed to the psychologist, the full extent of which I do not know, and the account given by the prisoner. The learned Crown Prosecutor in her helpful written submissions points out, without me now having to cite authority, that Courts will approach histories contained within medical and psychological reports prepared for court based upon the representations of a prisoner with caution and circumspection, particularly when the relevant history has not been subject to any form of test. In using my words I obviously paraphrase the greater eloquence of the expression of Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal. This is clearly a matter of common sense. As I say, much of her background is unremarkable and I rely upon many of the matters that she has told the Community Corrections and the psychologist in my fact finding, including matters relating to the circumstances of her family and the like. 

28The psychological report however is somewhat deficient in material respects. Firstly, the psychologist, who I would have felt was primarily retained to undertake the relevant psychometric testing that psychologists are trained to undertake, did not undertake any psychometric tests. When one reads the report, what one has, aided I assume by other information provided to the psychologist, perhaps from the Crown brief, perhaps from other sources, is an account of relevant events emanating from the version given by the prisoner. Of course, in that respect, there is an absence of substantial corroboration of many of the matters to which the prisoner refers. I have already made comments upon the aspects of the history provided by the prisoner that I accept. I have already made findings in relation to the objective facts and the subjective circumstances of the prisoner that include, as I have said earlier, acceptance of a number of the matters that the prisoner has asserted to various people. 

29The psychologist seeks to comment upon the ""degree of contrition"". Frankly, I do not have any reason essentially to doubt the essence of what the psychologist concludes, but the psychologist does not express any particular qualification that would permit me to conclude that he was better qualified than I to measure the contrition of the prisoner. Particularly as I now sit with the benefit of the conduct of the proceedings to their completion. 

30I accept, so far as it goes, that the prisoner is ""anxious"" in custody and that she has found prison life difficult. This would follow for a person who has never been in custody before. I accept that she has difficulties with communication because her English is limited. By the time she is released I would imagine her English will be somewhat improved. There are a number of Vietnamese people in custody of her sex with whom she can communicate, I have no doubt. Many of them have been sentenced in this Court. There are claims in the report of previous episodes of clinical depression and an opinion expressed by the psychologist that the offender is ""currently depressed."" I do not know what those words particularly mean. The psychologist is not qualified, in the context of what the psychologist has undertaken by way of examination and by reason of his academic qualifications, to make a medical diagnosis of a ""major depression."" But if he is endeavouring to express the opinion, which he should have expressed more clearly, that she ""depressed"" as a reaction to her current circumstances, I accept that to be so. 

31She told the psychologist, I note, that she understands that heroin would be dangerous to people and that she was ""very frightened by it"". But that is of little moment here in the circumstances where she continues to claim no knowledge of the fact that she was bringing heroin back into the country. 

32There is an assessment of risk factors for reoffending. These are somewhat self-evident from the history given by her to this Court and to the psychologist. She has no criminal history, which is a relevant matter to take into account. However the claim by the psychologist that she ""does not appear to have anti-social associates"" does not seem to fairly take into account the associates who recruited her to travel to Vietnam, whose real identities we do not know. She is said to not demonstrate ""anti-social attitudes"" during the interview. This I accept to be the case, but what weight I can give to what she exhibited during the interview in the context to the wider facts is another issue. It is thought that she did not appear to have anti-social personality traits. One of the matters that are identified as ""lower risk anti-social personality traits"" include ""excitement seeking, risk taking, dishonesty, impulsiveness and aggresivity"" (sic). 

33It might be fairly said that her involvement in this offence involved a considerable degree of risk taking and there was a degree of dishonesty in her reaction to her assessment by Customs. There has been, in my view, some dishonesty on her part in explaining her involvement in this offence, or her knowledge of what she brought into the country. But I am prepared to accept ultimately that generally speaking she does not have anti-social personality traits. 

34She denied any alcohol or illicit substance dependency. This is no consolation to this Court or to the community that she would be prepared to bring heroin into this country when she knows it is dangerous and she herself is not dependent upon it. She has given a history of her father's violence towards her mother and matters of domestic discord that have had some effect upon her, but there is absolutely no evidence, even in the psychologist's report at its highest, of any personality disorder or any mental illness or any condition suffered by the offender which is consequent to her upbringing and absolutely no evidence is available to the Court of any matter that arises out of consideration of the issues that were summarised in the judgment of Chief Judge at Common Law in the decision of De La Rosa, [2010] NSWCCA 194, a Commonwealth sentencing matter where the Court of Criminal Appeal considered, amongst many other matters, the general principles to be applied in dealing with a prisoner claiming to suffer from a mental illness or disability causally connected to the offending. 

35It is suggested by the psychologist that there is a pattern of poor decision making in this matter, particularly by reference to her involvement in gambling and subsequent matters. That may well be so but plenty of people have committed crimes as a result of poor decision making. The psychologist opines upon her prospects of rehabilitation and notes the confidence of the prisoner that she would not return to gambling. I cannot conclude one way or the other whether she would return to that.  But if she is telling the truth about gambling only to 2011, well that may be some evidence to support the fact that she may not return to gambling. This will be a matter for her to address in Vietnam, not in Australia.

36The psychologist formed the view that she was a satisfactory historian. It was expressed by the psychologist that in his opinion she had ""mood disorder, major depressive disorder of mild severity"" using what he described as the diagnostic criteria of DSM 4-TR. I am familiar with DSM 4-TR and related publications, I have an earlier edition of that Diagnostic Manual in my chambers. I accept that she has from her symptoms that are consistent with that assessment. But whether that is a diagnosis of that condition at this time is difficult to conclude if one cannot be entirely confident of the history given by the prisoner. In any event, there is no suggestion of any prior treatment for mental health disorder. If she is suffering any depression at the present time, as I said, it must be reactive to her circumstances. I have noted all that he said about her anxiety and related matters. 

37He did not elicit symptoms of the disorder that he describes as ""pathological gambling"" and thus, so far as it may be relevant, no diagnosis exists even within his report of a condition that might make the gambling of the prisoner in some way relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. In any event, the Crown very correctly has pointed to the authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the decision of Lee [2006] NSWCCA 136 and particularly in the judgment of Latham J therein, that dispensed with any claim of mitigation arising out of dependency upon gambling in circumstances such as this particular case. 

38The psychologist noted her anxiety of being separated from her parents, from her children and her family. This I accept. This is a natural reaction, it is not a matter of any pathology or of any particular significance for sentencing purposes. The psychologist reflects upon the success of her daughter in Australia and the contribution to her offending of her financial circumstances, both her financial obligations to her parents and arising out of her gambling. This may be so but offers no mitigation for the offending with which I am concerned.

39I have been taken to some very limited statistics from the Judicial Commission's database for sentences imposed between 2009 and 2013 for the offences that are covered by this particular provision with which I am concerned. They demonstrate a range of penalty between 12 months imprisonment, for which there is just one case; up to 12 years imprisonment, for which there is just one case. Mindful of what has been said in the Crown's submission about discounts in Commonwealth sentencing and the discretion to provide a discount in accordance with the usual practice in New South Wales, I assume, for the purposes of whatever weight I can give to the statistics, that the vast majority of the sentences that are reflected therein involve some discount of varying character to recognise the facilitation of the course of justice by the prisoner. In that regard I have had full regard to the learned Crown's very helpful written submissions on this matter. 

40Without having to reiterate in chapter and verse what the Crown says about this aspect of the matter, the Crown acknowledges, as it does in all of his matters, that there is a discretion to afford to a Commonwealth sentencing exercise, the discretion that is given to provide a discrete discount to recognise aspects of the plea of guilty. This is not contrary to the general principles set out by the High Court in Markarian from 2005. It is not contrary to what the High Court said when striking down guideline judgments for Commonwealth sentencing matters in the High Court decision of Wong. In this particular matter, noting all that the Crown has put, even though it submitted - ultimately half-heartedly - that the discount should be modest given the plea of guilty being entered within months of charging, being entered at the Local Court and being committed for sentence, I propose to provide the prisoner with a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to recognise the facilitation of the course of justice by the prisoner. 

41I appreciate of course that the Crown case is overwhelming and the proof of guilt of the prisoner at trial would be a very easy task indeed. But that having been said, there may well have been matters for a jury to consider in light of her insistence that she believed that she was carrying something other than a border controlled drug. 

42In terms of the evidence that is available, I have, naturally reflecting upon what I have said thus far, had regard to all the material that has been presented by the parties. The Crown prepared very helpful written submissions. The structure of the submission by learned counsel for the prisoner appeared to respond to the character of the submissions that were provided by the Crown, and to be frank, there is almost nothing within the Crown's written submissions with which there could be any dispute whatsoever. 

43So far as the defence submissions are concerned, it was submitted that she was a vulnerable person because of her financial difficulties. It was submitted too, that she should be sentenced as a person who was ""no more than a courier"", although it was acknowledged by learned counsel for the prisoner, who skilfully represented her interests, that of course she had a substantial role in the importation of the border controlled drugs. 

44I interpose to say the Crown conceded that she may be identified as a ""courier"", but the Crown submits, and it was acknowledged by counsel for the prisoner and is acknowledged by this Court, that ultimately, in the context of this issue, as it was discussed by the High Court in Olbrich, she was the principal importer. She was the person who brought the drugs into the country. I accept of course, in the context of all the evidence, that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she financed this venture. I accept, at the very least, that it is a reasonable possibility that she was recruited for a relatively modest sum, although when one adds up $18,000 and the cost of the travel, one reaches a figure of almost $20,000 for drugs that had a wholesale value of close $170,000. Thus she was to be generously rewarded in that sense.

45Having said that, I accept she is not the person who was the architect of this importation. There is no evidence enrichment on her part. No evidence of any substantial means of support that might have financed this importation. Although, of course, I am very mindful too of what a former Chief Judge at Common Law said once about the fact that courts do not have an intimate knowledge of the structure of syndicates that import drugs and courts should be very cautious to come to ready conclusions about what a particular person's role was in a particular ""organisation."" I do not even know if there is an organisation involved. I am not involved in the importation of heroin from Vietnam and no evidence is before me as to what is going on in Vietnam. What I do know, as is self-evident from the work of this Court particularly, many people are coming back from Vietnam, who are resident in Australia or citizens in Australia, bringing heroin back into the country, having left this country to go to Vietnam for that very purpose. Clearly there is a great deal of heroin coming out of Vietnam. Just as there is a great deal of crystal methamphetamine coming out of China. 

46I accept from the bar table, as I must given that the counsel for the accused is a man of high reputation, that the prisoner has not informed her children of the situation. I accept that the prisoner did struggle and make sacrifices to further her daughter's education. We had a discussion about the success of young people coming from other countries with limited English, a success that leaves those of us with modest educational achievements almost agog with disbelief. I wish her daughter well. But the truth is that the prisoner has not been able to tell her children of her current situation. This will increase her isolation.

47I have already made comments about what is the situation so far as her family is concerned. Her counsel referred to her responsibility for her parents, but I have already made the point that she was not in any position to provide much support, even before she got involved in this particular affair. I accept she has limited English and will have some difficulties in custody, and I have taken that into account. In assessing the sentence, her circumstances of custody will be somewhat different than others who have connection at a greater level here in Australia or who have better English skills than she.

48It must be noted, of course, that as is often said of people who come from foreign countries only for the purposes of importing drugs, that they must understand that they run the risk, if detected, of spending their time in custody facing these difficulties. Ultimately, it is a matter of little significance in the sentencing discretion.

49With regard to the Crown's submissions, the oral submissions were brief. To return to the written submissions and also to acknowledge some of the legal responsibilities I have, I note of course that the prisoner is to be sentenced in accordance with Pt 1B Crimes Act 1914 (CTH). Of particular importance, although a number of provisions are important within that Part of the Act, is the need to impose a sentence which is severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. The supposed ""checklist"" has been the subject of much discussion since the provision was introduced. It has been slightly amended over a period of time. There are cases such as Paull and El Kaharni dating back to 1990 and 1991, which confirm the fact that the failure to refer to general deterrence in the legislation did not mean that general deterrence was not a relevant factor in sentencing.

50I have had regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence. I have had regard to the maximum penalty and the yardstick it provides for fixing an appropriate sentence. I have had regard to the role of the offender and have already dealt with that matter. Of course, the Crown is quite correct to say that those who participate in the illicit drug trade at any level should expect and receive appropriately heavy sentences for the criminality which is revealed. The amount of the drugs is a relevant matter to take into account, but it is not the only determinant. It is just one of many factors to be taken into account in assessing the seriousness of the particular offending; the role of the offender, the moral culpability of the offender, all these matters are obviously also relevant to this issue. I note the quantity of the heroin in the context of the minimum quantity required to prove the offence and the maximum quantity that might be imported to satisfy the offence.

51The Crown notes that although there is no specific evidence that the offender was to receive any financial reward for her involvement in the offence (the written submissions I hasten to say refer to ""his role"" in the offence, which I take to be a typographical error), but it is common sense that there was a financial motive. I must say with respect that the history given by the prisoner herself clearly shows a financial motive in the manner I have already identified.

52I have already dealt with the issue of general deterrence. One need only go back to Veen No 2, the 1988 decision of the High Court to see in that judgment the identification of the purposes of sentencing, including general and personal deterrence, adequate punishment, promotion of the rehabilitation of offenders and the like. Some of those purposes of sentence now in fact form part of the statutory law of this State, in s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which is of course not directly or indirectly relevant to this offending. That having been said, it is also the case in Veen No 2 that the High Court pointed out that the purposes of sentencing were 'guideposts', but sometimes in particular cases they pointed in opposing directions.

53I have taken into account the guilty plea and I have dealt with that issue. I have taken into account the need for specific deterrence, the need for adequate punishment. I have taken into account the character, antecedents and background of the prisoner. I note the absence of prior convictions, which is a matter that is relevant and is a mitigating factor. I am mindful of the number of authorities that say that it might have less weight in particular types of offending. But it is still relevant in this matter. The sentence to be imposed on an offender committing this type of offence, say, with a prior conviction for importing drugs or supplying drugs, obviously one would have thought all other things being equal, be greater than the one that I will impose.

54I have dealt with the issue of the third parties in this matter and also the issue of gambling. I have particularly cited or paraphrased the more learned and eloquent words of her Honour Latham J in the decision of Lee to which I previously referred, particularly at [32]. I note her Honour said amongst other things, 

""The deterrent value of sentences imposed on those who import drugs would be undermined if leniency were extended merely on the basis that an unsophisticated and compliant offender came under the sway of more unscrupulous people"".

55It must be said that there are many people coming before our courts in exactly the same position as this prisoner; women, largely unattached or without other support, involving themselves in gambling, borrowing money from people that might otherwise be categorised as 'loan sharks', if they exist, and agreeing to import drugs into our country to satisfy debts that they have been encouraged to acquire. The truth of the matter is, as sad as it may be in a particular case, that such women or individuals who find themselves in that situation, must be discouraged from bringing dangerous drugs like heroin into our country simply to assuage gambling debts.

56I have had regard to the hardship to the offender's family. I accept particularly, the children of the prisoner will suffer. They will be missing their mother for a number of years and eventually the truth will come home. Imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence I can impose, pursuant to s 17A Crimes Act (Cth). I am required to fix a non-parole period. I note what the High Court said in Hili and Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45. The principles that relate to the fixing of non-parole periods in Commonwealth matters are as the High Court in Hili said those that have been recognised in previous decisions of the High Court such as the earlier Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 and Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623, applying the requirements of Pt 1B Crimes Act (Cth). 

57I also acknowledge that I am required to fix a minimum term that reflects a severity appropriate in all the circumstances, including the objective circumstances. I am required to backdate the sentence to the date the prisoner came into custody and I must explain the sentences imposed.

58The Crown has provided a schedule of what are claimed to be comparative cases. I do not say they are not roughly comparative, but none of them are on all fours with the case with which I am concerned. I will not refer in detail to the matters in the schedule because the Crown's written submissions are an exhibit in these proceedings.

59I have had regard to other authorities as well which deal with the range of penalty that might be imposed for an offence of importing similar quantities of prohibited drugs. Some of the offences with which the cases are concerned dealt with older legislation that referred to concepts such as the ""marketable quantity"" and the like. One such case, for example, is Huynh [2008] NSWCCA 16, particularly the judgment of Grove J and the matters cited by him at [22] to [24]. 

60There is the case of Mirza [2007] NSWCCA 257, there is the judgment in the matter of Lee itself that I earlier cited, which elicits the principles relating to sentencing offenders with claimed gambling addictions. I have sentenced a very similar offender in the matter of Nguyen, a decision I gave on 10 December 2009, in which I surveyed a number of the decisions, some of which I have quoted already. I have had regard to the statistics. I note the general range of penalty that the statistics may indicate, although I am mindful too, of what Spigelman J said in 1998 as to the deficiencies of statistics other than providing a very general guide for a range of sentences.

61In any event, the conclusion I have reached, having regard to the objective circumstances and the relevant subjective circumstances, weighing all matters as I am required to, is that the starting point for any sentence to be imposed upon this prisoner should be nine years' imprisonment. The prisoner is entitled, as I said, to a discrete discount of 25%. My calculation is that the sentence to be imposed thus should be six years and nine months. 

62I have given close consideration to the fixing of the non-parole period. I am mindful of the fact that the prisoner almost certainly will be deported. That will to some extent defeat the purpose of parole supervision in her case. I am mindful also of the fact that even if she was released to the community, the major matter that would need to be addressed by the parole authorities, one might have thought, in the absence of drug dependency, would be the issues of her associations, her gambling propensity and her financial circumstances. But in the context of the character of her incarceration, her isolation to some extent because of language difficulties and the like, having regard to the fact that this is her first time in custody, I have determined - bearing in mind I am required to fix a non-parole period in accordance with the general principles that apply in the sentencing of a minimum term for any prisoner, that the non-parole period in this matter should be four years and four months. 

63The prisoner may be released to parole at the end of that non-parole period, that will be a matter for the New South Wales Parole Authority in consultation with the Commonwealth authorities. She may spend some little time in detention prior to deportation and the like. These are all matters over which I have no control. All I can do is fix the minimum period of time that she will be required to remain in custody. 

64If you could stand up, please, ma'am. In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years and nine months. That term of imprisonment will date from 29 August 2013 and on my calculation, subject to correction by counsel, the prison sentence will expire on 28 August 2020. 

65In your case I fix a non-parole period of four years and four months. That shall commence on 29 August 2013 and expire on 28 December 2017. At that date you will be eligible for release to parole. It will be a matter, as I said, for the relevant authorities to determine whether you should be released to parole. If you are released to parole and permitted to enter the Australian community, you will be subject to the direction of the relevant Authority in the given state where you live. As to your conditions of freedom, such as where you shall reside, what courses you need to undertake, and if your parole is revoked you may be returned to custody. You may take a seat. 

66There is just one final matter I need to deal with, and I omitted to refer to it in the context of dealing with the Crown's very helpful submissions. It concerns the Crown's oral submissions. They were very brief, of course, because the written submissions are so thorough, and as I said, very little to comment critically of in relation to those documents. But I do not accept the Crown's specific oral submission that the fact that the particular prisoner left the country to pay off gambling debts as a reason for committing the crime was itself a matter that increased the objective seriousness of the offending.

67I am mindful of authority which I have read over the last week when I have had a chance, being involved in many other cases including a trial, where it has been held by superior courts to be an aggravating factor that a person specifically plans to leave the country to commit an offence by coming back into the country bringing drugs. But the element of this matter that seems to me not to be pertinent to that issue is that the offender did so to pay off gambling debts rather than for clear profit. I have taken into account the fact that the prisoner, on her own account, left the country in order to obtain what she imported back into the country as a relevant factor as the authorities otherwise require me to do.

68Any technical matters, Madam Crown?

69POCH: Your Honour, if your Honour can make an order for the destruction of the drugs.

70HIS HONOUR: I would have hoped they were destroyed months ago.

71POCH: Yes, they are.
 
72HIS HONOUR: Just for the purposes of the technicality of the sentencing, and this should be placed on the record, I have expressed the sentence in accordance with what I understand to be the Commonwealth method of expressing the sentence. The order of the Court, however, is expressed in terms of what the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act says. I have sentenced the prisoner to a non-parole period of four years four months, and the balance of the sentence is two years five months, expiring on 25 May 2020. That's the way the order is recorded, but in fact I have expressed it in accordance with what I understand to be the terms of s 19AB or BA of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Right you can go.

		24 November 2014",2014-07-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764361,Hampton v R [2014] NSWCCA 131,"Judgment1GLEESON JA:  I agree with Johnson and Bellew JJ.
2JOHNSON and BELLEW JJ:  On 5 April 2013, Nicholas Allan Hampton (""the Applicant"") pleaded guilty before the Local Court to two offences, namely:
(i)robbery in company contrary to s. 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900;
(ii)steal from person an offence contrary to s. 94 of the same Act.
3The maximum penalties for these offences are 20 years imprisonment, and 14 years imprisonment respectively.4On 7 June 2013 the Applicant was sentenced as follows:
(i)in respect of the offence of robbery in company a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment commencing on 3 February 2013 and expiring on 2 August 2015, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 3 August 2015 and expiring on 2 February 2018;
(ii)in respect of the charge of steal from person, a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 3 February 2013 and expiring on 2 February 2015.
5The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal against those sentences on the following four grounds:
(1)his Honour erred in failing to consider whether or not he ought take into account time served on an unrelated matter;
(2)the cases following the line of authority established by the decision in R v Niass (NSWCCA, 16 November 1988, unreported) are wrongly decided;
(3)his Honour erred in not properly taking into account the principle of totality;
(4)the sentence for the offence contrary to s. 97(1) of the Crimes Act was manifestly excessive.
THE FACTS6At about 9:15pm on 23 August 2012, two persons, Damian James (""James"") and Keanu Valido (""Valido"") boarded a bus from St Mary's Railway Station heading to Tregear.  The Applicant, and his co-offender (an unknown male) boarded the same bus.  In the course of the bus trip the Applicant and his co-offender asked James and Valido the time and inquired as to whether they had any credit on their mobile phones.
7The bus stopped outside a community centre in Elsworth Drive, Tregear at about 9:30pm.  James and Valido exited the bus and were followed closely by the Applicant and his co-offender.  
8As soon as the bus drove away from the stop the Applicant said:
 ""Hey mate.""
9James turned around and was immediately punched in the face by the Applicant, causing him to fall to the ground.  The Applicant then stood over the top of James.  
10Whilst this was occurring, the Applicant's co-offender stood close to Valido.  The Applicant then repeatedly yelled towards James:
""Give me your fucking wallet.""
11James responded:
""I don't have it.""
12The Applicant then said:
""Shut up, shut the fuck up, do you want to die?""
13The Applicant then grabbed an object from his hat and swung it in a downward motion towards James' leg.  He swung and missed on two occasions but on the third occasion struck James on the left leg just above the knee.  He then said again:
""Do you want to die?""
14The Applicant then approached Valido and said:  
""Give me all your money.""
Valido handed his wallet to the Applicant, saying:
""I have no money"".
The Applicant said:
""Give me your phone"".
Valido replied:
""I don't have one"".
15The Applicant then walked back over to James, grabbed his front left pocket and ripped out his wallet.  The Applicant's co-offender then asked James for his phone.  James replied that he did not have one.  
16The Applicant and his co-offender then ran away from James and Valido, who went home.  The police were contacted and they obtained CCTV footage of the bus trip which depicted clear images of the Applicant and his co-offender as passengers.  Subsequently, James identified the Applicant from a photo board as the person who struck him and stole his wallet.  
17As a consequence of the incident James received bruising to his left eye, a small one centimetre cut to his left leg and soreness to his shoulder.  
GROUND 1 - His Honour erred in failing to consider whether or not he ought take into account time served on an unrelated matter.GROUND 2 - The cases following the line of authority established by the decision in R v Niass (NSWCCA, 16 November 1988, unreported) are wrongly decided.
18These grounds, which are conveniently dealt with together, require reference to the sentence proceedings.    
19His Honour was taken to the details of the Applicant's criminal history and to his custodial record.  In doing so, the Applicant's solicitor, Mr Sandilands, pointed out that on the assumption that his calculations were correct, there was a period between 8 March 2012 and 2 June 2012 which the Applicant spent in custody but which did not appear to be referable to any sentence which had ever been imposed upon him for any offence (at T13 L11-16).  The following exchange then took place (commencing at T13 L 47):  
""Crown:  Your Honour the Crown concedes that it appears that that doesn't relate to anything on his criminal history, however my submission is that's completely irrelevant to this current offence.
His Honour:  I must say I've had the argument Mr Sandilands has had a long time ago when I was counsel and - - 
Crown:  Offenders can't be given a free kick just because there seems to be some unaccounted time - - 
Sandilands:  But he did .. (not transcribable)..in gaol.
Crown:  It has no relevance to this offence whatsoever.  
His Honour:  That may be so in the sense of relevant punishment directly attributable to this offence, however, if he's been punished when there was no reason to punish him; I think I can take that into account.
Crown:  It's a matter for your Honour. We don't have any paperwork in that regard and I can't provide any - - 
His Honour:  There may be, I don't know, it may be simply a refusal of bail in respect of other matters. 
Crown:  That's right. 
His Honour:  But - -
Crown:  Which is likely in my submission given - - 
His Honour:  Well unless it's - and I doubt it, very poor record keeping, but it's more likely to be a refusal of bail. And that tends to be kind of confirmed by why you would be transferred from a fulltime custody gaol to a metropolitan remand centre unless you're (sic) status as a sentenced prisoner had changed.
Crown:  That's correct.
His Honour:  Notwithstanding the fact that he's transferred on the 13th and not the 8th.
Sandilands:  Just to assist your Honour, my instructions are, and you won't have it there, is that it was referable to bail refuse (sic) and was referable to a matter that he was ultimately found not guilty of.  
His Honour:  Right.
Sandilands:  They're my instructions.
Crown:  In that case your Honour it's - - 
His Honour:  I hear you Madam Crown.
Crown:  Thank you your Honour.""
20There was no further reference to the issue in the sentence proceedings, nor was there any reference to it in his Honour's judgment.  Evidence was given by the Applicant in the sentence proceedings.  He said nothing about his period in custody between 8 March 2012 and 2 June 2012, and, in particular, made no reference to anything which occurred in that period which was said to be relevant on sentence (AB50-58).
21The Applicant's submissions depend upon a construction of what occurred in the District Court during the sentencing submissions which, as outlined above, were relatively brief.  The Applicant's submissions require acceptance, by this Court, that the sentencing Judge was invited to take into account (or give credit for) a period between 8 March and 2 June 2012 when the Applicant was in custody, having been refused bail on charges upon which he was ultimately discharged at the Penrith Local Court on 20 August 2012.  
22The exchange which took place between his Honour and the representatives of each party was, as set out, somewhat fluid.  However, after the solicitor for the Applicant revealed his instructions that the period in question had been served by the Applicant in the circumstances referred to in [19] above, no further submission was advanced that that period ought be taken into account in some way in selecting a starting date for the sentences to be imposed.  
23For all of these reasons, the foundation for these grounds is somewhat shaky.  The Court should keep in mind concerns which have been expressed where error is said to arise based upon interchanges between the Bench and counsel during submissions:  R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at [11]; R v Thompson [2005] NSWCCA 340; 156 A Crim R 467 at 474-475; [32].  These grounds also appear to strain the limits of permissible grounds of appeal as explained in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 477-478; [79]-[82].  
24However, on the assumption that a sufficient foundation is crystallised for Grounds 1 and 2, it is necessary to address them.  
25The transcript of the sentence proceedings reveals that the solicitor for the Applicant invited the sentencing Judge to take into account, and give credit to the Applicant for, his time in custody between 8 March and 2 June 2012 for an unrelated matter.  The fact that he was discharged with respect to that matter was a factor added very late in the submission, and was unaccompanied by any submission that that aspect operated further in the Applicant's favour.  As previously noted, the Applicant made no reference to that time in custody when giving evidence.
26In these circumstances, the bare invitation for the sentencing Judge to take this period into account on sentence ought be taken, at its highest, as an invitation to the sentencing Judge to approach this period as being a form of ""credit in the bank"" for the Applicant, to be considered on sentence for the later offences committed on 23 August 2012.   The Applicant appears to submit that the sentencing Judge was bound to consider this matter and to take it into account in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
27The decision of this Court in R v Niass appears to stand in the way of that submission.  That decision makes it clear that where what is sought to be done is to invite a sentencing court to take into account, as a relevant matter, a period in custody for an unrelated matter leading to acquittal or discharge, that factor is not, in and of itself, relevant to the sentencing exercise.  
28Relevant statutory provisions confirm that time for which an offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence for which sentence is to be passed is a mandatory factor to be taken into account on sentence:  ss.24(a), 47(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  There is nothing in s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which supports the Applicant's submission.  It is true that s.21A is not exhaustive and factors available to be taken into account at common law remain available.  However, this brings one to the decision in R v Niass, which has been applied frequently in this State.
29Later decisions of this Court tend to confirm this approach.  Some have involved an acceptance that where other events occur during such a period in custody, those events may bear upon the issue of sentence.  However, that is because they relate to the offender's subjective circumstances:  R v Evans (NSWCCA, 21 May 1992, unreported); R v Webster and Jones (NSWCCA, 3 August 1992, unreported); R v Chung (NSWCCA, 9 March 1994, unreported); R v David (NSWCCA, 20 April 1995, unreported); R v Hudd (NSWCCA, 5 December 1995, unreported); R v Baartman (NSWSC, Dunford J, 18 December 1988, unreported); R v Karageorge [1999] NSWCCA 213; R v Giam (No. 2) [1999] NSWCCA 378; R v Rozynski [2001] NSWCCA 257; Huntingdon v R [2007] NSWCCA 196 and Kerr v R [2008] NSWCCA 201.
30These decisions confirm an approach that bare reliance on a period in custody for an unrelated matter, without more, is extraneous to the exercise of sentencing discretion for other matters.  This is particularly so where there is a broken period of custody, as exists in this case.
31If events occurred during the period in custody which could otherwise be called in aid of the offender's case on sentence, such as marital breakdown, loss of employment, development of illness or other aspects which could bear upon the person's subjective circumstances on sentence for offences later committed, then that may be relevant on sentence.  R v Evans appears to be an example of this approach.
32To succeed on Ground 2, it is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate that the approach taken in R v Niass and subsequent cases is clearly wrong:  Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 490-491 [84]-[85].  In R v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 at 380, it was said that the Court of Criminal Appeal is not bound by its earlier decisions, but should depart from such decisions with caution, and only when satisfied that the law and justice of the case required such a result.  On one view, this approach appears to be less onerous than that described by Heydon J in Green v The Queen.  It is unnecessary to consider on the present application whether the statement in R v Mai (at 380) was intended to state a different test to that stated in R v Johns [1978] 2 NSWLR 259 at 262, 264 that this Court is not bound to follow an earlier decision if it was satisfied that the decision is wrong:  R v Arnold [1993] 30 NSWLR 73 at 85-86 (Abadee J; Gleeson CJ agreeing at 74).  It is sufficient to observe that departure from a previous decision would require a strong conviction that the previous decision was incorrect:  R v Arnold at 85E-F; Jimmy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540 at 570; [127].  The principle in Green v The Queen is consistent with the general approach when construing uniform national legislation where the rule of comity applies, so that a court at the same level in the judicial hierarchy should not depart from an earlier decision of another court unless convinced that the earlier decision is plainly wrong:  R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278; 63 NSWLR 628 at 665 [156].
33The Applicant did not submit before this Court that R v Niass, insofar as it related to the ""credit in the bank"" concept, was wrong or should not be followed.  In these circumstances, the issue goes no further.  
34Decisions of courts in other States concerning the commencement date of sentences appear to depend upon local statutory provisions, and the approach of Judges in those jurisdictions operating within their own statutory frameworks.  To the extent that Ground 2 invites this Court to adopt the reasoning and apply decisions in other States (including R v Renzella [1997] 2 VR 88 and other decisions to which the Court was referred in argument), particular care is needed.  This Court has noted that caution should be exercised where matters of practice and procedure in one jurisdiction are relied upon in support of arguments in this jurisdiction:  R v NZ.
35The New South Wales decisions in this area should be applied.  A proper foundation has not been established for a conclusion that any decision under challenge was plainly wrong and should not be followed.  In any event, these decisions appear to be based upon the particular circumstances of each case where the broad statement in R v Niass has been applied.  Properly understood, no error is revealed in any of those decisions.
36If it was concluded that the sentencing Judge was indeed asked to take into account this period in custody on sentence, no error has been demonstrated by the Applicant in the circumstances of this case.
37Even if some error was demonstrated, a proper examination of this period could not lead to a result favourable to the Applicant.  At the highest, the Applicant can point to about two months in custody against a background of years in custody serving other sentences.  There is nothing about this period which would attract any factor which operates in his favour by reference to his subjective circumstances.  
38Further, the approach to sentencing in this case would have to take into account (in a manner not applied by the sentencing Judge) that the present offences were committed whilst the Applicant was subject to conditional liberty, being on bail for another alleged offence.  Further, factors already operating powerfully against the Applicant on sentence, being specific deterrence and general deterrence, would be further escalated by examination of the circumstances, which saw him committing these serious offences on 23 August 2012, whilst subject to conditional liberty and within three days of being discharged on the matters giving rise to the earlier period in custody.
39Grounds 1 and 2 ought be rejected.
GROUND 3 - His Honour erred in not properly taking into account the principle of totality.40Ground 3 claims that the sentencing Judge erred in not properly taking into account the principle of totality.  This ground is misconceived.  The Applicant was to be sentenced for two offences.  The sentences imposed were entirely concurrent and there was no element of accumulation at all.  The sentencing Judge was not asked to take into account, on the question of totality, the four-month sentence which he was serving for take and use a conveyance prior to the commencement of these sentences.  The decision to make the sentences entirely concurrent was a generous one for the Applicant given that two separate victims were no doubt terrified as a result of their being targeted for robbery after leaving a bus and in a public street.
41This ground should be rejected.
GROUND 4 - The sentence for the offence contrary to s. 97(1) of the Crimes Act was manifestly excessive.42The circumstances of the offending have been set out.  His Honour said (commencing at ROS 11):
""So far as the objective seriousness of the offence is concerned, I note that the offences were committed in company, which is an element in the more serious offence, that they involved threats which were significant and I take those to be aggravating in the circumstances. I note that there does not appear to have been a great deal of premeditation, the amount of property taken is in fact relatively miniscule, the victims were vulnerable, being on public transport, and there were two separate victims although it has to be said that in the circumstances they were part of one continuous episode of criminality.
In terms of the objectives of punishment it is clear that there has to be an element of general deterrence, there has to be an element of specific deterrence, and I take into account the general purposes of punishment as outlined in the legislation and the authorities. I also take account, in respect of the robbery offence, of the guideline judgment of Henry. There are distinctions between this case and Henry, in particular it seems to me that the plea is at an early opportunity and should be given the full utilitarian discount and there is (sic) some elements, obviously, that should be taken into account in that the offender had little or no recollection in reality of the offences because of his Benzodiazepine intake and yet has facilitated the course of justice"".
43A report under the hand of Danielle Hopkins, psychologist, was tendered before the sentencing Judge.  That report set out that the Applicant is a person of aboriginal heritage whose childhood involved frequent moving between various locations in Sydney, the Central Coast and the Hunter Valley.  His Honour found that the relationship between the Applicant and his parents was a volatile one, characterised by continuing domestic violence.  He also found that the death of the Applicant's father marked the start of what he described as the Applicant's ""negative behaviour"" and that thereafter, the Applicant's mother, as a result of her use of cannabis and alcohol, played no real maternal role.  
44There was evidence that the Applicant commenced consuming alcohol at the age of 13 years of age, that he had remained a regular consumer of both alcohol and cannabis since that time, and that he commenced amphetamine use at 15 years of age, from which he developed a significant habit resulting in the implementation and continuation of a methadone program from the age of 18.  The Applicant also became addicted to benzodiazepines which, at one point, saw him consuming 6 Xanax tablets up to three times each week.
45His Honour found that the Applicant had been unable, because of his custodial history, to undertake any extensive rehabilitation, be it residential or otherwise.  He also found that the Applicant had expressed genuine remorse and had gained some insight into his offending behaviour.  All of these matters led his Honour to express the following conclusion (at ROS 7):
""I indicated before that he has not been given a non-parole period; he needs, it seems to me, to be given the opportunity to be supervised to cope with his substance abuse, his poor coping skills, his emotional and behavioural regulation and his consequential thinking skills.""
46His Honour then concluded (at ROS 11):
""It seems to be that there are special circumstances particularly having regard to the offender's need for rehabilitation. I take into account what are sometimes referred to as Fernando criteria but in reality a recognition by the courts of the fact that persons from extremely deprived or violent backgrounds need to be dealt with a degree of leniency.""  
47In imposing the sentences previously outlined, his Honour recommended that as far as conditions of parole were concerned, the Applicant should be given the benefit of any drug or alcohol treatment program or counselling, along with the benefit of any education or work-related programs, anger management programs and medical treatment.
48As previously noted, the maximum penalty for the offence contrary to s.97(1) of the Crimes Act is imprisonment for 20 years.  The sentence imposed upon the Applicant involved a head sentence of five years with a non-parole period of two years and six months.  His Honour's finding of special circumstances gave rise to this substantial variation of the statutory ratio.  
49This was a serious offence committed by a person who had a significant history of offences, including offences of violence.  He had been sentenced by Bell J in December 2004 for offences of manslaughter and entering a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation.  The remarks on sentence in those proceedings (R v Hampton [2004] NSWSC 1215) make clear that her Honour approached the sentencing of the Applicant upon a basis sympathetic to his deprived upbringing and other factors which operated in his favour on sentence.  Bell J observed (at [24]) that it was difficult to assess the likelihood of reoffending, or to meaningfully assess his prospects of rehabilitation, but concluded that, as he was a young offender (18 years old), it was appropriate that the Court place some emphasis on rehabilitation in the sentence.
50The sentencing Judge in the present proceedings was informed that the Applicant had not been released on parole.  Limited information was provided to his Honour in this respect, emanating from the Applicant himself. Whatever view may be formed concerning the approach of the State Parole Authority on this topic, it would suggest that the prospects of the Applicant's rehabilitation, as considered by that body in 2010, were not favourable.  Since then, the Applicant has committed further offences, including the serious offences to which the present appeal relates.  
51In reality, the Applicant's subjective circumstances are no better than they were before Bell J in 2004.  Indeed they are worse, in that the present offences were committed when he was 28 years old, and reflect significant acts of violence committed against members of the public in vulnerable circumstances where they have stepped off a bus, being followed by the Applicant and his accomplice who had targeted them for the purpose of ""rolling"" the victims.   The gravity of offences committed against persons in and around the public transport system, and the consequent importance of general deterrence in such matters, has been emphasised by this Court:  R v Kelly [2005] NSWCCA 280; 155 A Crim R 499 at 501-502 [6]; R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 41-42 [207]-[208]; R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40 at [52].
52The primary offence under s.97(1) involved the use of actual force by the Applicant against the victim, accompanied by threats to kill the victim.  This was a very serious offence, as the sentencing Judge found.  That conclusion is not challenged in this Court, nor could it reasonably be challenged.
53The Applicant is able to call in aid on sentence his deprived upbringing as revealed in the approach adopted by Bell J in 2004, and by his Honour Judge McClintock SC in 2013.  These subjective aspects do not diminish with the passage of time and the Applicant's repeated offending and incarceration:  Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 87 ALJR 1022 at 1032 [42]-[44].  That said, the Applicant has continued to commit violent offences in relation to which the principles of sentencing should apply, including the necessity to impose appropriate punishment, recognition of the significance of specific deterrence and general deterrence, as well as the hope that rehabilitation may still be possible in his case, despite the experience of the last decade.
54At the conclusion of his sentencing remarks his Honour said:
""Now you understand the sentence Mr Hampton.  I have given you an extended period of parole, you have never had it before in terms of you have never been given it.  You will not be released to parole if the parole board decide that you are not a good candidate for parole but on the other hand it seems to me if you make an effort with the help of Probation and Parole you will be helped by them hopefully with courses that allow you to get a job and settle down and make a contribution"".
55There was no evidence that the Applicant's prospects of rehabilitation had improved since 2010 (see [50] above).  His Honour did not identify any significant positive sign(s) which indicated that if the Applicant was allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation was likely to be successful, as opposed to being a mere possibility (R v Tuuta at [57]).  The mere fact that the Applicant had never been given parole was not such a sign.  Notwithstanding these matters, his Honour found special circumstances and fixed a relatively short non-parole period with a significant balance of term, thereby giving the Applicant an opportunity to prove himself in custody and to obtain conditional liberty on parole.  His Honour's finding was, to say the least, a generous one and was largely unsupported by the evidence.  
56The reality is that the sentencing Judge took a sympathetic view towards the Applicant.  His Honour said as much at the conclusion of his remarks on sentence.  
57The Applicant has not demonstrated that the sentence in respect of the s.97(1) offence was manifestly excessive.
58Although leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed.
59PRICE J:  I agree with Johnson and Bellew JJ.
60GARLING J: I agree with Johnson and Bellew JJ.

2764365,R v Hickman [2014] NSWDC 277,"Judgment


	
	A woman claims she was sexually assaulted by a man on 3 June 2012. The Director of Public Prosecutions has laid an indictment against the man, charging him with having sexual intercourse with the woman without her consent knowing that she was not consenting. The charge in that indictment will be tried before me sitting in Albury during the week commencing 13 October 2014.
	
	
	In the meantime the man charged wants to subpoena three persons and one institution to produce documents to the Court. The forms of the subpoenas are attached to an affidavit by the man’s solicitor, Mark Cronin, which Mr Cronin swore on 11 June 2014.
	
	
	It is apparent, from reading the identities of the recipients of those subpoenas and the kinds of documents which are sought by the subpoenas, that the documents are likely to be counselling communications. (That expression “counselling communication” is defined in s 296(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)). It is also likely that at least some of those communications may be protected confidences as defined in the same section.
	
	
	Mr B Hughes SC appears for the accused man. He argues that I should make an order issuing the subpoenas under s 299B(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act. Ms C Mendes, who appears for the woman who is making the allegation, argues that before I can issue those subpoenas in accordance with the order that Mr Hughes seeks, Mr Hughes needs my leave in accordance with s 298(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act. That provision relevantly says that except with my leave “a person cannot seek to compel...any other person to produce a document recording a protected confidence in...any criminal proceedings.”
	
	
	Ms Mendes goes on to argue that Mr Hughes then has to meet the requirements of s 299D of the same Act. That provision requires a number of conditions to be met (to express it in broad terms) before I can grant leave to issue the subpoenas. Realistically it would seem that Mr Hughes SC would be in no position to satisfy me of those conditions without me seeing the documents themselves. Ms Mendes argues that such an outcome is consistent with the purpose of the legislation. The purpose of the legislation, she argues, is meant to be very restrictive and to protect such counselling communications which become protected confidences in accordance with the criteria set out in s 299D of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Hughes SC argues that s 299B resolves that preliminary difficulty for him. He points out how it provides that if a “question arises under this Division relating to a document or evidence, a court may consider the document”. He points out that the section also provides that a “court may make any orders it thinks fit to facilitate its consideration of a document...under this section.” Mr Hughes SC argues that such powers are given to me obviously to enable me to consider as a preliminary matter the contents of the documents so that I can more easily determine the application for leave which he is likely to make under s 298(2) of the Act for the documents to be produced and made available to the parties.
	
	
	Baston JA had occasion to consider this dilemma in KS v Veitch (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 266; 84 NSWLR 172; 229 A Crim R 46. Harrison and Beech-Jones JJ agreed with his Honour. His Honour pointed out at [27] that the “procedural steps set out in s 299B become necessary in circumstances where the court is required to consider the criteria identified in s 299D, even for the purpose of considering a grant of leave to issue a subpoena.” His Honour compared the provision with an earlier version of s 298 which did not display the current tension which seems to exist between s 298(1) and s 299B. His Honour concluded at [28] that s 299B reflects the procedural purpose that “the court have access to the document before deciding whether it should be made available to a party and that it should have the relevant powers to ‘facilitate its consideration of’ the document”. His Honour pointed out that the “potential inconsistency between that provision and s 298(1) (in its current form) was addressed by the inclusion of s 299B(5)”. That provides in express terms that s 299B “has effect despite sections 297 and 298.”
	
	
	It seems to me that Mr Hughes SC’s argument is correct and that I am empowered to make an order issuing the subpoenas which his client seeks to issue in order to determine the matters which I need to determine relevant to any application for leave for the production of documents or their admission into evidence.

		19 February 2015",2014-07-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764370,W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: W (the appellant), was indicted on 10 charges of sexual offences arising out of events said to have taken place on or about 30 September 1992 (Counts 1-5) and between 1 October 1992 and 31 October 1992 (Counts 6-10).

2Count 1 on the indictment charged that on or about 30 September 1992 the appellant indecently assaulted AH (the complainant), a person under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1990 (NSW) (the Crimes Act).

3Count 2 on the indictment charged that on or about 30 September 1992 the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent and knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation (namely, that the complainant was under the age of 16 years), contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act.

4Count 3 was an alternate count to Count 2. It charged that on or about 30 September 1992 the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person under the age of 16 years, in circumstances of aggravation (namely, that at the time of the offence the complainant was under his authority) contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act.

5Count 4 charged that on 30 September 1992 the appellant attempted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent and knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation (namely, that at the time of the offence the complainant was under the age of 16 years) contrary to ss 61J and 61P of the Crimes Act.

6Count 5 was an alternative to Count 4. It charged that the appellant attempted sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person under the age of 16 years, in circumstances of aggravation (namely, that at the time of the offence the complainant was under his authority) contrary to ss 66C(2) and 66D of the Crimes Act.

7Count 6 charged that between 1 October 1992 and 31 October 1992 the appellant indecently assaulted the complainant, a person under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act.

8Count 7 charged that between 1 October 1992 and 31 October 1992 the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent and knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation (namely, that at the time of the offence the complainant was under the age of 16 years) contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act.

9Count 8 was an alternative to Count 7. It charged that the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person under the age of 16 years, in circumstances of aggravation (namely, that at the time of the offence the complainant was under his authority) contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act.

10Count 9 charged that between 1 October 1992 and 31 October 1992 the appellant attempted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent and knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation (namely, at the time of the offence the complainant was under 16 years of age) contrary to ss 61J and 61P of the Crimes Act.

11Count 10 was an alternative to Count 9. It charged that the appellant attempted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person under the age of 16 years in circumstances of aggravation (namely, that the complainant was under his authority) contrary to ss 66C(2) and 66D of the Crimes Act.

12The appellant was found unfit to plead. As a consequence a special hearing under s 21 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (the Forensic Provisions Act) was required. The hearing was by a judge alone. 

13The judge who conducted the hearing (the trial judge) found the appellant not guilty of Counts 2, 4, 7 and 9. He found on the limited evidence available the appellant committed the offences described in Counts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 10 (Forensic Provisions Act, s 22(1)(a)). The judge imposed a limiting term of imprisonment on each of those counts, partly accumulated, but in total commencing on 8 March 2013 and expiring on 7 June 2016. It will be necessary to deal with the structure of the sentence later in the judgment.

14Section 22(3)(c) of the Forensic Provisions Act provides that a verdict in a special hearing is subject to appeal in the same manner as a verdict in an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings. Similar provision is made for an appeal from the imposition of a limiting term under s 23(3) of the Forensic Provisions Act.

15The appellant has appealed against the verdict in respect of Counts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 10 and against the severity of the limiting term. Leave to appeal was not sought in relation to the sentence appeal or in respect of Ground 4 of the conviction appeal which raises factual issues. Such leave in my opinion was necessary. However, no point was taken on this issue in the written submissions or at the hearing of the appeal. In these circumstances, it is appropriate that leave be granted.

16The grounds of appeal are as follows:

""Conviction Appeal:

Conviction Ground 1 - Failure to Properly Take Into Account Subramaniam.

Conviction Ground 2 - Failure to Give and Take Account of a Proper Longman Direction.

Conviction Ground 3 - Failure to Give or Give Effect to a Murray Direction.

Conviction Ground 4 - The Verdict is Unsafe and Unsatisfactory.

Sentence Appeal:

Severity Ground 1 - Failure to Take into Account the Applicant's Likely Mental State at the Time of the Offences.

Severity Ground 2 - The Sentence is Manifestly Excessive.""

17Having regard to the nature of the grounds of appeal and the submissions of the parties, it is necessary to set out the course of the trial in some detail.

The hearing

(a) The evidence of the complainant

18The complainant gave evidence that she was born on 15 June 1978.

19She said that her mother, SLW, and the appellant formed a relationship when she was very young. She remembered living with the appellant and her mother at farms, first around the Canowindra area and then the Casino area. 

20The complainant said that her mother and the appellant got married when she was about 10 or 11 and her sister Jacqueline was born when she was about 12.

21The complainant said that the first sexual interaction she had with the appellant was around the time she was aged 11. She said she remembered her mother being pregnant and the relationship between the appellant and her changed. It started off with small interactions. She said she noticed that the appellant was spending more time talking to her and would start touching her inappropriately. She said that the appellant would touch her breasts and if she were sitting on his lap he would push his penis against her.

22The complainant said that when she was about 13 or 14 the appellant tried to have sexual intercourse with her. She said that it happened more than once, saying that apart from two occasions she could not put a time frame on it.

23The complainant gave evidence that in 1991 she was given a diary by a person she described as her best friend, CW, in which she wrote ""everything that was current in my life at the time, anything that was important, day to day things, the way I felt, things that happened to me, things I did"". She said that she could recall the date of one of the occasions on which the appellant attempted to have sex with her because she had a reference to it in her diary and also because it correlated with other things that were happening in her life at the time.

24In that context the complainant referred to an entry in her diary of 30 September 1992 at which time she said she was 14 years of age, living at a house in Cable Street at Canowindra. 30 September 1992 was the date on which the events, the subject of Counts 1- 5, were alleged to have taken place.

25The complainant said that on 30 September 1992 she thought that she was at home with the appellant and her sister was somewhere in the house, perhaps asleep. She said that the appellant had been talking about his plans for the future and was touching her and fondling her. She said that the appellant touched her on her breasts and her genitals whilst they were in the lounge room. She said that at the time she was sitting on the appellant's lap whilst he was on a chair. That alleged incident was the subject of Count 1.

26The complainant said thereafter they went into the bathroom and the appellant tried to have sex with her but was not able to have complete sexual intercourse at the time. She said that she and the appellant were in the bathtub, both of them standing up.

27The complainant said that the appellant could not get his penis completely into her vagina but it went in to some extent and it hurt a lot. She said he did not achieve complete penetration of her vagina but that his penis did penetrate her genitalia.

28This incident was the subject of Count 2 and the alternate Count 3.

29The complainant said that this went on for possibly up to half an hour. She said the appellant then tried to put his penis into her anus. She said that she was not entirely sure that he was able to do so although subsequently she said his penis did enter her anus, but not far. She said thereafter they finished in the bathroom, she went off to her bedroom and he went off frustrated and angry.

30The complainant said she referred to these incidents in her diary. It is convenient at this stage to set out the extract from her diary which became Exhibit C:

""Wed 30/9/92

Today was a shit. I honestly think [W] is going to leave us. And its mostly my fault. The brightest parts of my day has been when Christine and Glenn rang up and coming here - to Belinda's.

[W] said that I was to make sure Jaki knew that he tried to be a good father for her. Then he went on to say what was Jaki's, like what she was entitled to and after that he implyed [sic] that you loved him, that he was leaving. Its my fault, not entirely but partly, because I wouldn't take part in P.C.

P.C. is something very involved, personal and threatening, scary. It's so personal it could totally ruin [W]'s life, so I daren't say much about it, for fear of causing more pain and fear of him.

It is also partly HIS fault too because he is being so frigging pig-headed and obnoxious. If he does leave, part of me will leave too. Part of me will disapear [sic] because the way I can stand to live life in my house is to lean on [W] for support.

I cant stand to see Mum upset either, as much as she pisses me off, it still hurts. Then to have Jaki grow up without a father - like me, all these things are a part of me, that make up my sense of family. Without my family it would just be, Jaki, Mum and I. No details, no light, no joy, happiness, a dull incomplete homelife.

Glenn really cheered me up - Thank you Glenn. I really needed it. I pray I can go to Wyangalla and camp with them this week and I also pray Mr Watson wasn't listening. Oh time to go to bed.""

31The complainant said that she made the entry in her diary shortly after the incidents of 30 September 1992. She explained that she wrote that she thought the appellant was going to leave her family because she knew he was disappointed with what occurred in the bathroom and that there was a lot hinging on the occasion.

32The complainant said that the reference in her diary to ""P.C."" was a reference to the sexual contact which had occurred. She said she used those letters to throw the appellant off the trail of what she was writing. She stated that she was certain that the appellant had been reading her diary and had been removing some entries. She said she could see where pages had been torn out.

33The complainant said that by 30 September 1992 the appellant and her mother were estranged and were in separate bedrooms. Her evidence was to the effect that the incidents the subject of Counts 6-10 occurred in the morning in the lounge room and in her mother's bedroom whilst her mother was at work. 

34She said on that day in question the appellant was pushing himself against her, his penis against her, sucking her nipples and touching her vagina. She said she was still in her pyjamas. That alleged incident is the subject of Count 6.

35The complainant said that thereafter she and the appellant went to her mother's room and got into her bed. She said the appellant had her sitting over the top of his body and he was pushing her body down onto his penis and at some stage he tried to remove her pyjama pants and penetrate her as well. She said they were later in another position were the appellant was behind her and she was on her knees. She said he did not obtain complete penetration but his penis did go into her genitalia. This incident was the subject of Counts 7 and 8.

36The complainant said that for a short time thereafter the appellant was lying on top of her. She said that it was only for a short time. He tried to penetrate her vagina but she was not willing to be part of it so she made it difficult and did not let him penetrate her entirely. She said it was not for a very long time, about a minute, and he did not achieve complete penetration. Immediately after that she was asked whether he penetrated her genitalia at all and she said yes. This alleged incident was the subject of Counts 9 and 10.

37The complainant said that she told her friends, CW, ST and MM about the incidents. She said she also told a teacher, JS, who was now dead.

38In cross-examination the complainant stated that she went to Belinda's house after the events of 30 September 1992, taking her diary with her. She admitted she did not tell Belinda anything about what occurred on that day.

39The complainant was asked questions in cross-examination about the words in her diary ""PC"". She said the words ""wouldn't take part in PC"" referred to the fact that she made it difficult for him to have full intercourse with her. She was referred to her evidence that she used the letters ""PC"" as a code so the appellant would not know what she was talking about and was asked to explain how, if he was involved in attempted sexual assault, he could not understand what ""PC"" was. She gave the following answer:

""A. When he was involved in sexually abusing me and he would read these entries, the idea was that he wouldn't have any direct reason for ripping it out and, therefore, it would - it would prove to him that he couldn't go and pull pages out of my diary because that would - that would contradict everything he stood for.""

40She was also asked the following questions about the entry and gave the following answers:

""Q. Now, are you able to tell us how you came upon the letters PC to stand for what you say were sexual assaults by [W]?
A. I chose that because I had no - it was by chance.

Q. It was by chance. Something very involved, personal and threatening, scary, so personal it could totally ruin [W]'s life, yes?A. Yes.

Q. Could it have been referring to the marijuana that you tell us he was growing on the property?A. No.

Q. You tell us in your statement that he was growing marijuana on the property and smoking a lot of marijuana at the time, don't you?A. He was.""

41The complainant was also asked questions about the entry in the diary ""It's my fault, not entirely but partly, because I wouldn't take part in P.C."". She said ""the long and short of that part of the entry"" was that she thought the appellant was going to leave because she wouldn't take part in allowing him to have sex with her. She said she wrote, ""It is also partly HIS fault too"" because she was a child when she wrote it. She said from her perspective as a child with somebody who was taking care of her, she felt very guilty that she could not make him happy and that what she was referring to by ""his fault"" was that she could see quite clearly it was his fault that he was molesting her.

42The complainant acknowledged she wrote the words, ""If he does leave, part of me will leave too. Part of me will disapear [sic] because the way I can stand to live life in my house is to lean on [W] for support"" a few hours after she was sexually assaulted. 

43The complainant was also questioned about what she had said in her statement to the prosecuting authorities that she told the teacher, JS about the sexual abuse. She was referred to her statement to the police to the following effect:

""In my diary I have made a note that I told a school teacher.... He was my physical development teacher at the Canowindra High School. I was in year 7 at the time. [He] is dead now. I'm not sure if he made notes or told anyone what I told him. In my diary I made notes that I told him on 18 August 1991.""

44The complainant was unsure why she referred to 18 August 1991 in her statement. She was then referred to her diary entry of 18 August 1991:

""Hi. Last week mum and [W] were at each other's throats. Mum was seriously thinking of getting a divorce. That really worried me. On Thur afternoon English was last period. I started bawling. [JS] and I talked for about 20 minutes. The next day I talked to [JS] for a whole period. He was in a way counselling me but he was being a friend too. Luke was the first I told about it.""

45The complainant said that at the time of the entry in her diary she had told JS that her stepfather was assaulting her. She was unable to explain why JS did not do anything about it except to say that it was a small town.

46The complainant was also asked about a diary entry of 2 November 1991 which was to the following effect:

""I've totally ballsed up. I've stuffed [W]'s life up completely. About six months ago [W] started teaching me about what he has worked for most of his life. It's how you use your brain to think properly. I've ruined everything. He is in the lounge room screwing all his notes up. Yesterday he gave me a trial to see I would go on teaching my kids what he is teaching me to preach to other people. I chose all the wrong choice [sic]. On the third and final go he said to me, after I chose, 'You're free to go.' It sounded so final, so definite, I feel guilty, like a murderer. I am a murderer in a way because I murdered all he has believed in, but what I can't work out is why I should be guilty. I mean it was his choice to throw everything away. Despite that I still feel grief. I don't think [W] loves me, but I wish he did. I love him. [W] won't ever forgive me. I wouldn't. I feel really horrid.""

47It was put to the complainant that this had nothing to do with the appellant sexually abusing her and she gave the following answer:

""A. It does. It does. What you don't see in this is my emotional account of the conversation we would have had. The conversation was around pursuing his life's work, which was for us to have a relationship which would continue on and in his - in his words, to procreate. So that's what this is with regard to, was that I was upset because I had kept turning him away. I couldn't fulfil what he wanted emotionally and physically I wasn't willing to do it and that's why I've recorded that, 'I feel so guilty. I feel like a murderer. Everything he has worked toward I've ruined and I feel - I feel bad', and that states - that goes towards showing you the type of life I was living.""

48It was put to the complainant and she agreed that there was no reference to the October 1992 incidents in her diary.

49The complainant was recalled subsequently to give evidence and said that she wrote to her friend, CW, about everything that was going on in her life and anything that was going on at the time.

(b) The evidence of SLW

50SLW, the complainant's mother, gave evidence that whilst she was working the children were left in the care of the appellant. She said that before the complainant did the Higher School Certificate she and the appellant were experiencing relationship difficulties and he had moved into a separate bedroom. SLW said that the appellant left the house in 1994. She said that she and the appellant slept in separate rooms for about nine months before that. She denied in cross-examination that he moved into a separate room because he had a bad back. 

51SLW confirmed that the appellant had problems with his back, particularly in the colder months.

(c) The evidence of CW

52CW said she was very good friends with the complainant and that they spent a great deal of time together from Years 7 to 10.

53She stated that she recalled the complainant staying at her house in about September 1991. CW said at the time the complainant was crying and told her that the appellant had been touching her and fingering her. She said the complainant told her she could not tell her mother because she was worried that her mother would not love her anymore and she would get taken away from her mum and her younger sister.

54CW said she remembered receiving a letter from the complainant towards the end of 1992. She said that the letter said that the appellant ""had tried to do it again"". She said she did not keep the letter.

55CW recalled that in 1994 the appellant told her she would like to tell somebody about what was going on and she wanted to talk to JS. She said she went to JS's office with the complainant and the complainant was upset and crying but she did not tell JS what was actually wrong.

The reasoning of the trial judge

56The trial judge early in his judgment referred to the decision of the High Court in Subramaniam v The Queen [2004] HCA 51; (2004) 79 ALJR 116, in which the High Court had indicated the appropriate directions to be given to a jury at a special hearing. His Honour said that he gave himself such directions. His Honour also set out the verdicts which were available to him under s 22 of the Forensic Provisions Act.

57His Honour also gave himself the following directions which he subsequently described as warnings:

""Insofar as the offences are concerned I give myself the following directions:

That the Crown bears the onus of proof at all times;

That the standard of proof in each of the counts is proof beyond a reasonable doubt;

That the case depends on my accepting the evidence of [AH] ('the complainant'). There is no independent objective evidence and the complainant is the only Crown witness capable of giving direct evidence about the central events in the case. That being the case I must scrutinise the complainant's evidence on each charge very carefully before determining whether I accept her evidence on the critical maters to which she gave evidence;

That I should consider the complainant's evidence in the context of all the other evidence including the accused evidence;

That the balance of the Crown case is peripheral and was given to assist me to resolve the fundamental question, in relation to the central aspects of each of the allegations, of whether I was prepared to accept the complainant's evidence beyond reasonable doubt;

That these alleged events occurred in 1992 and I direct myself that there has been a significant delay in reporting the allegations and that this has resulted in a significant forensic disadvantage to the accused. In relation to that I am satisfied that the accused, leaving aside the fact that he has been determined as being unfit to be tried, did not have the capacity as a consequence of the delay in time of calling evidence to refute the allegations made;

That the delay in time leads to the possibility of distortion in recollection by the complainant and other witnesses;

That the delay in bringing these proceedings, has prevented the accused from being able to point to circumstances which may have contradicted the complainant;

That had the accused learnt of the allegations earlier in time he may have been able to recall events and relevant details that could have been used by his counsel in cross-examination of the complainant:

That the accused, if he learnt of the allegations earlier, may have been able to find witnesses or other evidence that may have contradicted the complainant's evidence or supported his case;

That the accused as a consequence of the delay has been placed in a position of significant disadvantage which may have prejudiced the conduct of the defence and that being the case I warn myself that before I find the offences proved I must carefully scrutinise the prosecution case.""

58The trial judge summarised the evidence in chief of the complainant, which I have referred to above. He also noted a number of matters arising in cross-examination. First, that the complainant immediately after the incident on 30 September 1992 went to her friend Belinda's house but did not say anything to her. Second, that there was no reference in her diary to speaking to JS about sexual abuse notwithstanding she told the police she spoke to him in August 1991.

59His Honour also summarised the evidence of CW to which I have referred in pars [52] - [55] above.

60His Honour referred to the evidence of SLW that the appellant moved into a spare room in the house about nine months before he left, which was in 1994. He referred to the submission by counsel for the appellant that the complainant was clearly in error in stating that the appellant and her mother were living in separate rooms when the incidents in 1992 occurred. He also referred to the submission that the complainant's evidence that she told JS about the incidents could not be accepted. He also noted the submission that the contents of the diary were ambiguous and did not refer directly to sexual intercourse and to the fact that there was no reference to the October incidents in the diary.

61His Honour repeated the direction to himself that the complainant's evidence must be scrutinised with great care. He said that having scrutinised her evidence very carefully he accepted her evidence and was satisfied as to her reliability.

62The trial judge indicated he was satisfied that the complainant had made complaint in respect of incidents which preceded the 1992 events and had recorded the September 1992 events in her diary. He said that did not corroborate the complainant but made it more believable than it would have been had she not recorded it.

The conviction appeal

The submissions of the parties

63The appellant at the outset of his written submissions put a number of matters relating to the evidence which both he and senior counsel who appeared for him at the hearing submitted were relevant to each of the grounds of appeal.

64The appellant referred in particular to the fact that there was nothing in the diary kept by the appellant prior to 30 September 1992 regarding any sexual interaction with the appellant notwithstanding the complainant's statement that such interaction occurred prior to that time. He also pointed to the fact that the alleged offences in October 1992 were not referred to in the diary.

65The appellant referred to the fact that although the complainant said she made the diary entry at the home of Belinda on 30 September 1992, the day the events the subject of the first five counts were said to have occurred, she did not tell Belinda of the incident.

66The appellant referred to what was put to the complainant in cross-examination, namely that the words in the diary ""I would not take part"", suggest that the complainant had nothing to do with the incident in question. He submitted that her explanation that she was an unwilling participant in ""PC"" warranted considerable scrutiny. It should be noted in this context that the trial judge acquitted the appellant of Counts 2, 4, 7 and 9, an element of each of which was absence of consent.

67The appellant also submitted that the complainant's evidence that she used the code ""PC"" because she was concerned the appellant would read her diary as he had previously torn out pages did not bear close scrutiny. He submitted that the complainant's account that the entry in her diary, ""There was one entry that had to be pulled out because somebody's lifestyle was at stake"", reflected a threat of someone finding out the appellant was molesting her also did not bear close scrutiny.

68The appellant submitted that it was inherently unbelievable that the use of the code ""PC"" occurred by chance, submitting that the complainant in her evidence was about to give a reason for the use of the code and then changed her mind.

69Further, the appellant contended that the account by the complainant of the appellant's actions after the events of 30 September 1992, namely, that he was in the lounge room surrounded by papers, making noises, getting rid of papers and talking about how everything he had worked toward was all for nothing, could not be accepted in light of her diary entry of 2 November 1991 which she initially conceded had nothing to do with sexual activity but subsequently changed her evidence to say it was for ""us to have a relationship which would continue"".

70The appellant emphasised there was no entry in the complainant's diary concerning the October 1992 events. Further, he pointed to the fact that her evidence that the appellant and her mother were occupying separate rooms at the time was inconsistent with her mother's evidence.

71The appellant pointed to the absence of complaint. He pointed to the fact that the complainant said she had told her friends, SW and MM, about the incidents and they did not give evidence. He pointed to the fact that the only evidence of CW was that the complainant had told her in September 1991 that ""[W] had been fingering her"" and at the end of 1992 she wrote a letter saying, ""[W] had tried to do it again"".

72The appellant pointed to the inconsistency between the complainant's evidence that she told JS about the abuse when she was in Year 10 and her statement to the police that she spoke to him in August 1991. He submitted that the diary entry of 18 August 1991 was inconsistent with her telling JS of any sexual abuse at that time as distinct from her concern that the appellant and her mother were thinking about a divorce. He also pointed to the fact that if JS was told, he did nothing about it and the evidence of CW was that she went with the complainant to see JS in 1994 and the complainant did not tell JS what actually was wrong.

73The appellant also made some further general submissions which were said to be relevant to the first three grounds of appeal. He referred to the fact that s 21B(2) of the Forensic Provisions Act required that the determination of a judge at a special hearing must indicate the principles of law applied by the judge and the findings of fact on which he or she relied. Consistent with what was said by the High Court in Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 197 CLR 250 at [28], he submitted there must be a reasoning process linking the principles of law and findings of fact and justifying these findings and the verdict reached.

74The appellant also pointed to the fact that in a judge alone trial, justice must not only be done but be seen to be done and that that was not achieved by reciting some of the evidence and finding that notwithstanding some inconsistencies, the complainant was honest and compelling and thus the offences were proved.

75The appellant stated the effect of s 133(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) was that it was necessary to state why notwithstanding any required warnings, a particular verdict was reached. He submitted this could not be done in a perfunctory manner and must be seen to have been done.

76The appellant submitted that where the judgment of the trial judge suggested he had not taken account of each of the warnings in reaching his verdict and did not invoke reasoning in line with the evidence relevant to each issue, he would not have satisfied the requirements of s 21B of the Forensic Provisions Act.

77With that background, it is appropriate to turn to the specific submissions on each ground of appeal.

Ground 1

78The appellant submitted that the effect of the decision of the High Court in Subramaniam v The Queen supra, was that the trial judge was required to take into account the following four matters:

The Appellant may not have been able to participate or contribute to his defence.

The Appellant may not have been capable of making a reasoned decision about that, or indeed other matters concerning the hearing, or even as to whether or not to plead guilty.

The special hearing is to be conducted so as to not prejudice the accused any more than his unfitness already may do.

There are various ways in which evidence at a hearing of this nature may be limited. The Appellant, for example, may have been unable to give evidence, or unable, by reason of his mental unfitness to give adequate instructions concerning the calling of witnesses who might assist his case, or, as to matters on which cross-examination could be based.

79The appellant submitted that notwithstanding the trial judge's reference to Subramaniam v The Queen supra in his judgment, the direction required played no part in his reasoning.

80The Crown submitted there was no basis for finding that the trial judge having referred to the applicable direction in Subramaniam v The Queen supra did not apply it.

Grounds 2 and 3

81The appellant submitted that notwithstanding the provisions of s 165B of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), the trial judge was required to give himself a Longman warning (Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; (1989) 168 CLR 79).

82Senior counsel for the appellant submitted at the hearing that s 165B of the Evidence Act had no application in a non-jury hearing. She submitted in those circumstances the judge was bound by the common law. She submitted that the rationale for s 165B, that juries would take serious warnings as a direction to acquit, had no application to a judge and that there was, therefore, no reason why such a warning was not required in a judge alone trial.

83In submissions filed following the conclusion of the hearing, the appellant submitted that the effect of s 165B(2) of the Evidence Act was that no direction was required under that section until an application for such a direction was made. He submitted that as no such application was made the section was not engaged.

84The appellant submitted that by contrast an application was made for a Longman warning. He submitted that the effect of s 9 of the Evidence Act was that such a direction was not prohibited by s 165B if it was otherwise available under the common law.

85The appellant pointed to the fact that in Reeves v R; R v Reeves [2013] NSWCCA 34 at [418] the Crown accepted that the common law principles applied in a trial without a jury.

86The appellant submitted that although a request for a Longman warning was made, the trial judge did not direct himself properly in that regard and it was not properly applied in his reasons. He submitted the obligation was not discharged and not seen to be discharged.

87The appellant noted that the trial judge indicated that because the case depended on him being able to accept the complainant's evidence, he must scrutinise her evidence very carefully before accepting her on the critical matters. The appellant also acknowledged that the trial judge had given himself the warnings to which I have referred to at par [57] above.

88However, the appellant submitted that a proper Longman warning further required that the judge proceed with extreme caution, directing himself that recollection and particularly recollection of childhood events, is frequently erroneous and liable to distortion. It was submitted that the trial judge took no account of the danger that the complainant's recollection, although genuinely held, may have been inaccurate. He submitted that the real issue was that the complainant was unreliable rather than untruthful.

89The appellant also submitted that the trial judge failed to direct himself in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 to the effect that it was necessary to scrutinise the uncorroborated evidence of a witness with great care before proceeding to a conviction (Murray direction).

90The appellant submitted that the evidence of CW fell well short of corroborating what was alleged. He also submitted that as the diary was written by the complainant herself, it did not corroborate her evidence in the true sense and that the entries in the diary were, in any event, equivocal.

91The appellant submitted that factors such as the complainant's age, the relationship between the appellant and the complainant's mother possibly giving rise to animosity and jealousy, the complainant's anger with the appellant, the feeling of guilt exhibited in her evidence and in the diary entries, the delay in complaint, the inconsistencies between her statements to the police and cross-examination and the inconsistency between her evidence and that of CW, all should have been referred to and considered. In these circumstances it was submitted that the trial judge erred in not giving effect to an adequate Murray direction.

92The appellant submitted that a fair reading of the evidence of CW did not support the complainant and only went so far as to say she was told touching had occurred at the end of 1992. The appellant submitted that in light of the appellant's significant disadvantage, it was not open to the trial judge to regard the inconsistencies as not being material. He submitted that significant disadvantage arose to himself from his state of mind, the unexplained delay in making the complaint, the complainant's age, the sexual nature of the offences and the inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence.

93The appellant submitted that the trial judge summarised the complainant's evidence but noted only two of the matters arising out of cross-examination, namely, the lack of contemporaneous complaint to the complainant's friend Belinda and the absence of any reference to her speaking to JS on 18 August 1991.

94The appellant submitted that the trial judge did not consider the absence of a reference to the October incidents in the complainant's diary. He submitted that although the trial judge referred to the evidence of the complainant's mother that the appellant did not move into a separate bedroom until 1993, he did not pay regard to the fact that that was inconsistent with the complainant's evidence of what occurred in her mother's room in 1992.

95The appellant submitted it was not enough for the trial judge merely to say the complainant was highly intelligent and her evidence had a ring of truth to it.

96The Crown submitted that having regard to s 165B(4) of the Evidence Act, the trial judge would have been in error if he had given himself a Longman warning. It was submitted that the warnings the trial judge gave himself were appropriate and no miscarriage of justice had been demonstrated.

97In supplementary submissions filed after the hearing, the Crown submitted that the effect of s 21(1) of the Forensic Provisions Act was to make applicable to the special hearing the same provisions and requirements as would apply to a trial. In these circumstances, it was submitted, s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act applied.

98The Crown pointed to the fact that s 133(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act provided that if any Act or law required a warning to be given to a jury, the judge is to take the warning into account. It submitted the effect of s 165B(4) of the Evidence Act was that a Longman warning was not required.

99The Crown submitted that in any event the warning the judge gave himself was consistent with the Longman requirements. 

100In relation to Ground 3 the Crown submitted that in fact the trial judge had given himself a Murray direction and had followed it.

Ground 4

101The appellant submitted that having regard to the evidence the trial judge ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant.

102The Crown pointed to the fact that the complainant's evidence was that the appellant started to touch her when she was 12 years old. It was pointed out that her first complaint was to her best friend, CW, after the start of Year 7 which was in 1991. It was submitted that CW confirmed that in September 1991 the complainant was upset and crying and a complaint of sexual interference was made. CW also said that she received a second complaint in the 1992/1993 school holidays and that in 1994 the complainant said that she wanted to tell someone and CW accompanied her to see JS.

103The Crown submitted that the diary entry and the evidence of CW were highly probative of the sexual abuse. The Crown submitted that the complaint need not relate to a specific offence.

104The Crown referred to s 165A(1) of the Evidence Act which stated that a jury should not be warned that children belong to a class of witnesses to be regarded as unreliable. It was also submitted there was no evidentiary basis for finding the complainant felt animosity and jealousy to the appellant.

105The Crown submitted that given the time passed, the inconsistencies in the evidence of the witnesses were not significant. It submitted that any residual doubt the Court may have would be resolved by the advantage of the trial judge seeing the witnesses and hearing the whole of the evidence.

Consideration

106It was not in contest that a special hearing under the Forensic Provisions Act conducted by a judge alone was a trial to which the provisions of s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act applies (s 21(1) Forensic Provisions Act, R v Zvonaric [2001] NSWCCA 505; (2001) 54 NSWLR 1 at [5]-[10] and [46] and EK v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 199; (2010) 79 NSWLR 740 at [37]-[38]). 

107Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides as follows:

""133 Verdict of single Judge

(1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.

(2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied.

(3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.""

108The requirements of the section were summarised by the High Court in Fleming v The Queen supra, in which the High Court considered its predecessor, s 33(2) and s 33(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, which was in identical terms. Relevantly, the Court indicated (at [27]-[28]) that the requirements, now expressed in s 133(2), were not satisfied merely by a bare statement of the principles of law applied and the findings of fact made. The reasoning process linking these matters and justifying the findings of fact must be demonstrated. Not to do so amounts to an error of law. The Court summarised a failure to expose the relevant principles of law that were applied in the following terms:

""[30] Seventhly, if the judgment fails to show that the judge applied a relevant principle of law, two possibilities are presented. One possibility is that, notwithstanding such failure, the principle was applied. Upon that hypothesis, there has been a breach of s 33(2) by reason of the omission from the judgment. The other possibility is that the principle was not applied, with the result that, independently of the question of breach of s 33(2), there has been an error of law which may attract at least the second limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The obligation imposed by s 33(2) was to ensure that the judgment included all principles of law which the judge applied. Unless the judgment shows expressly or by implication that the principle was applied, it should be taken that the principle was not applied, rather than applied but not recorded.""

109In relation to the requirement to give warnings, the Court made the following remarks:

""[32] The obligation imposed by s 33(3) 'to take the warning into account' is not only to be discharged but also to be seen to be discharged. The means by which the obligation may be discharged is that indicated in s 33(2), namely the inclusion in the reasons for judgment of the particular requirement for a warning among the principles of law applied by the judge. The various requirements that warnings be given have been expressed as rules of law or practice. The failure to give such a warning does not always lead to the setting aside of a conviction. But that does not mean that it is not a principle of law within the terms of s 33(2). The judge is obliged by s 33(3) to take the warning into account and in doing so the judge applies a principle of law. 

[33] The result is to require the recording and heeding of a warning, if one is called for in the particular case, and the giving of effect to it in a real sense by stating reasons why, notwithstanding the warning or as a consequence of it, a particular verdict is reached. A mere recording or statement of it, without more, would amount to an empty incantation. If these criteria are not satisfied in a particular case, then the judge is to be taken as not discharging the obligation imposed by s 33(3) that the warning be taken into account.""
(Citations omitted).

110There are three matters which can be noted about the section. First, as the High Court pointed out in the extract at par [108] above, the requirement in s 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act is satisfied if the judgment shows by implication the relevant law which was applied. Second, although the judge must not only take the warnings required to be given by a jury into account and be seen to take them into account, it is sufficient if, as a matter of implication, it can be seen from the judgment that he or she did take them into account. At [32] of the judgment in Fleming v The Queen supra, which I have cited above, the Court stated that the obligation to be seen to take a warning into account can be satisfied in the same manner as an exposition of the principles of law referred to in s 133(2). Thus, it can be done either expressly or by implication.

111Third, s 133(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act only relates to warnings. It does not require that every direction that a judge gives to a jury in a criminal trial needs be referred to by a judge in giving judgment in a judge alone trial. 

112With that background it is convenient to deal with the grounds of appeal.

Ground 1

113Section 21A of the Forensic Provisions Act provides that at a special hearing the question of whether the person has committed an offence is to be determined by a judge unless an election is made in accordance with that section for the question to be determined by a jury. When a case is to be tried by a jury s 21(4) requires the following:

""21(4) At the commencement of a special hearing for which a jury has been constituted, the Court must explain to the jury the fact that the accused person is unfit to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, the meaning of unfitness to be tried, the purpose of the special hearing, the verdicts which are available and the legal and practical consequences of those verdicts.""

114In Subramaniam v The Queen supra, the High Court set out an appropriate form of explanation for a trial judge to say. It is lengthy and it is only necessary to set out the concluding paragraph:

""I should emphasise that although I am telling you about the legal and practical consequences of any verdict that you may reach in order for you to understand the nature of the special proceeding in which we are engaged, your duty is confined to deciding whether, on the limited evidence available, the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence(s) charged. The consequences of the verdict and what is to happen to the accused thereafter are matters for the Mental Health Review Tribunal, the prosecuting authorities and the Court, not for you.""

115Immediately thereafter, the Court made the following comment at [41]:

""It is not immediately clear why the jury should be burdened with the sort of detail that the Act requires with respect to the legal and practical consequences of their verdict. Perhaps the requirement is intended to give the jury an assurance that a guilty person will not escape the consequences of his or her crime by reason of a temporary mental infirmity, or that a mentally unfit person will be humanely treated, even if convicted. Whatever the reasons, the language of s 21(4) is mandatory and must be given effect.""

116Contrary to the submissions of the appellant, which proceeded on the assumption that the jury direction required by s 21(4) of the Forensic Provisions Act is a warning, the above passages make it clear that the direction required by s 21(4) is not a warning to the jury but rather an explanation of what is required in a hearing under s 21. It thus does not fall within s 133(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, notwithstanding that the special hearing can be described as a trial for the purpose of that subsection.

117It follows for this reason alone that the ground of appeal is not made out.

118Further, the trial judge stated that he had given himself a direction in accordance with Subramaniam v The Queen supra. There is no reason not to accept that statement. He complied with the duty imposed on him in concluding that on the limited evidence available the accused committed some of the offences. This was consistent with what the final paragraph of the suggested direction in Subramaniam v The Queen required.

119It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.

Grounds 2 and 3

120Section 165B of the Evidence Act provides as follows:

""165B Delay in prosecution

(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding in which there is a jury.

(2) If the court, on application by a party, is satisfied that the defendant has suffered a significant forensic disadvantage because of the consequences of delay, the court must inform the jury of the nature of that disadvantage and the need to take that disadvantage into account when considering the evidence.

(3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

(4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in informing the jury of the nature of the significant forensic disadvantage suffered and the need to take that disadvantage into account, but the judge must not in any way suggest to the jury that it would be dangerous or unsafe to convict the defendant solely because of the delay or the forensic disadvantage suffered because of the consequences of the delay.

(5) The judge must not warn or inform the jury about any forensic disadvantage the defendant may have suffered because of delay except in accordance with this section, but this section does not affect any other power of the judge to give any warning to, or to inform, the jury.

(6) For the purposes of this section: 

(a) delay includes delay between the alleged offence and its being reported, and

(b) significant forensic disadvantage is not to be regarded as being established by the mere existence of a delay.

(7) For the purposes of this section, the factors that may be regarded as establishing a significant forensic disadvantage include, but are not limited to, the following: 

(a) the fact that any potential witnesses have died or are not able to be located,

(b) the fact that any potential evidence has been lost or is otherwise unavailable.""

121This section was inserted into the Evidence Act in 2007 to commence from 1 January 2009. The proceedings commenced on the charging of the appellant on 31 December 2009. As such the provisions in the Evidence Act applied: R v TJ [2009] NSWCCA 257; (2009) 76 NSWLR 167 at [14].

122In Longman v The Queen supra, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated (at 91) that it was necessary to give the following warning in the case of delay:

""The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy.""

123In R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60; (2002) 54 NSWLR 241 Sully J, after reviewing Longman v The Queen supra and the cases which followed it, particularly Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161 and Doggett v The Queen [2001] HCA 46; (2001) 208 CLR 343, summarised the requirement of a Longman warning in the following terms (at [95]):

""The approach of the majority Justices in both Crampton and Doggett seems to me to entail that a trial judge who is framing a Longman direction must ensure that the final form of the direction to the jury covers in terms the following propositions: first, that because of the passage of time the evidence of the complainant cannot be adequately tested; secondly, that it would be, therefore, dangerous to convict on that evidence alone; thirdly, that the jury is entitled, nevertheless, to act upon that evidence alone if satisfied of its truth and accuracy; fourthly, that the jury cannot be so satisfied without having first scrutinised the evidence with great care; fifthly, that the carrying out of that scrutiny must take into careful account any circumstances which are peculiar to the particular case and which have a logical bearing upon the truth and accuracy of the complainant's evidence; and sixthly, that every stage of the carrying out of that scrutiny of the complainant's evidence must take serious account of the warning as to the dangers of conviction.""
(Emphasis in original).

124The other members of the Court agreed with this formulation (at [4] and [119]).

125Section 165B(4) of the Evidence Act prohibits the giving of such a warning. The reason for the insertion of the section was said to have been that such a direction was considered an encroachment on the fact-finding task of the jury and open to the risk of it being interpreted as a direction to acquit: Explanatory Memorandum to the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 (Cth) at [226].

126The appellant argued that s 165B(4) of the Evidence Act did not apply to a judge alone trial and only prevented the Longman warning from being given to a jury. However, the question was whether s 133(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act as explained in Fleming v The Queen supra required the judge to give himself such a direction and be seen to have done so. 

127In my opinion this question must be answered in the negative. Section 133(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act requires the judge to give to him or herself a warning if one is required to be given to a jury by an Act or law. In the present case rather than requiring such a warning, the Act in fact prohibited it. 

128The appellant also submitted that s 165B(4) of the Evidence Act was only engaged in the event an application for a direction was made under s 165B(2). He submitted that in the present case an application for a Longman warning was not made under s 165B(2) and the effect of s 9(1) of the Evidence Act was to require the common law direction to be given.

129I do not agree. Section 9(1) applies when the Evidence Act does not provide, either expressly or by necessary implication, to the contrary. In the present case s 165B(4) has expressly prohibited a Longman warning.

130However, as an application for such a direction was made, it would seem to me the effect of s 165B(2) of the Evidence Act was to oblige the judge, if he was satisfied the appellant suffered a significant forensic disadvantage because of the consequences of delay, to inform himself of the nature of the disadvantage and the need to take it into account when considering the evidence.

131The trial judge, in my opinion, did this. I have set out the warnings above (par [57]). The trial judge recognised that the delay had resulted in a significant forensic disadvantage to the appellant in relation to the calling of evidence, his own recollection and his inability to find witnesses.

132His Honour in those circumstances did not err in failing to give a Longman warning.

133Nor do I think that the trial judge erred in failing to give himself a Murray direction.

134The judge gave himself such a direction (see par [57] above). He pointed to the fact that there was no independent objective evidence and that the complainant was the only Crown witness capable of giving direct evidence about the events which occurred. He directed himself that he must scrutinise the complainant's evidence on each charge very carefully before determining whether he should accept it. He repeated that direction towards the conclusion of his judgment.

135In these circumstances it does not seem to me that the ground of appeal that the judge failed to give himself a Murray direction has been made out.

136The next question is whether the judge's reasoning disclosed that he gave effect to the direction. In that regard it must be remembered that consistent with Fleming v The Queen supra it was necessary for his judgment to expose his process of reasoning. A mere incantation of the warnings and directions without them being taken into account is insufficient: Fleming v The Queen at [33] (see also Pettitt v Dunkley (1971) 1 NSWLR 376 at 381-382, 385 and 388 and Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 (Soulemezis v Dudley) at 257-258).

137The trial judge delivered judgment the same day the complainant finished giving her evidence. His task involved consideration of whether, after scrutinising the evidence of the complainant very carefully and having regard to the other evidence and the inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence, he could accept the complainant as reliable on the critical issues, beyond reasonable doubt, taking into account the forensic disadvantage in which the appellant was placed.

138The trial judge accurately summarised the complainant's evidence in chief. He considered the 30 September 1992 diary entry, whilst not corroborative of the 30 September 1992 events, supportive of the complainant's evidence having previously noted the submission that the diary entry was ambiguous and did not refer to sexual intercourse.

139The trial judge referred to CW's evidence of the complaints made to her in 1992 that ""[W] tried to do it again"" or ""[W] had done it again"" in the context of a complaint to her in 1991 that [W] had been ""fingering her"". He noted the evidence of CW that at the meeting with JS in 1994 the complainant made no reference to the sexual assault.

140The trial judge also noted the evidence of the complainant's mother that the appellant did not move out of her bedroom until 1994.

141The trial judge also referred to a number of matters of note that emerged from cross-examination. He referred to the fact the complainant did not tell her friend Belinda of the incident of 30 September 1992 when she went to her home. He noted there was no reference in the diary to speaking to JS in August 1991 about the sexual assault in the context of the fact that she told the police in the statement made by her to them that there was such an entry. He also referred to the fact that there was no reference to the October incident in the diary.

142After referring to these matters and stating that he had considered what the appellant's counsel had to say about her reliability, the trial judge expressed satisfaction on this question.

143The appellant stated that the evidence of CW fell well short of corroboration. The trial judge did not suggest it was corroborative. He accurately summarised the complaints made to CW, to which I have referred above. So much was conceded by senior counsel for the appellant.

144Contrary to the appellant's submissions, I do not believe it was necessary to refer to the appellant's age or the fact there were some entries in the diary demonstrating feelings of guilt and anger towards the appellant. The obligation on the judge was to adequately expose his reasons in a case where, as he recognised, the evidence of the complainant needed to be scrutinised with great care. The relevant standard was set out in Pettitt v Dunkley supra in the following terms:

"" ... where in a trial without a jury there are real and relevant issues of fact which are necessarily posed for judicial decision, or where there are substantial principles of law relevant to the determination of the case dependent for their application upon findings of fact in contention between the parties, and the mere recording of a verdict for one side or the other leaves an appellate tribunal in doubt as to how those various factual issues or principles have been resolved, then, in the absence of some strong compelling reason, the case is such that the judge's findings of fact and his reasons are essential for the purpose of enabling a proper understanding of the basis upon which the verdict entered has been reached, and the judge has a duty, as part of the exercise of his judicial office, to state the findings and the reasons for his decision adequately for that purpose. If he decides in such a case not to do so, he has made an error in that he has not properly fulfilled the function which the law calls upon him as a judicial person to exercise and such a decision on his part constitutes an error of law.""

145This passage was approved by the High Court in Fleming v The Queen supra at [22]. However, the need to provide reasons is not only to enable a party to exercise appeal rights but as stated in Fleming v The Queen in the same paragraph, to enable justice to be seen to be done.

146The importance of the giving of reasons for a judicial decision was summarised by McHugh JA in Soulemezis v Dudley in the following terms:

""The giving of reasons for a judicial decision serves at least three purposes. First, it enables the parties to see the extent to which their arguments have been understood and accepted as well as the basis of the judge's decision. As Lord MacMillan has pointed out, the main object of a reasoned judgment 'is not only to do but to seem to do justice': The Writing of Judgments (1948) 26 Can Bar Rev at 491. Thus the articulation of reasons provides the foundation for the acceptability of the decision by the parties and by the public. Secondly, the giving of reasons furthers judicial accountability.""

(The third reason given by his Honour as to the precedential value for future cases, is not relevant in this case.)

147However, as McHugh JA pointed out in Soulemezis v Dudley (at 280-281), the obligation does not require lengthy or elaborate reasons, although it is necessary that the essential ground or grounds on which the decision was based should be articulated and in many cases the reasons for preferring one conclusion over another should be given. However, where the resolution depends entirely on credibility, he stated it was probably enough that the judge simply finds one way over another: see also CJ v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 258 at [91], Alchin v Daley [2009] NSWCA 418 at [35], R v Keyte [2000] SASC 382; (2000) 78 SASR 68 at [56] and R v Power [2003] SASC 77; (2003) 141 A Crim R 203 at [52]-[57].

148In the present case the trial judge gave himself the requisite warnings, dealt with the evidence of the complainant, the evidence of the other witnesses, some of the inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence and stated that after taking the appellant's submissions into account, he accepted the complainant as reliable as to the occurrence of the events the subject of the charges on which the appellant was convicted. In these circumstances, in my opinion, he fulfilled his obligations under s 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act to expose his reasoning principles.

149In these circumstances Grounds 2 and 3 of the grounds of appeal have not been made out.

Ground 4

150The principles on which this ground is to be determined were reaffirmed by the majority of the High Court in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 in the following terms:

""[11] It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v The Queen by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:

'Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.'

[12] This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v The Queen McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to 'unsafe or unsatisfactory' in M is to be taken as 'equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as ""unreasonable"" or such as ""cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"".'

[13] The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.'

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter.""
(Citations omitted).

151It is not enough for the verdict to be unreasonable that a review of the evidence shows only that it was possible for the jury (or in this case the trial judge) to reach a different conclusion. That was made clear by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559. In a passage with which Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreed, his Honour made the following remarks:

""[113] It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant's guilt on this first count. But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. In the present case, the critical question for the jury was what assessment they made of the whole of the evidence that the complainant and the appellant gave that was relevant to the issue of consent to the digital penetration that had occurred in the park. That evidence did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.""
(Emphasis in the original, citations omitted). 

152However, it is not sufficient that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. So much is made clear in the passage from M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, cited in SKA v The Queen supra at [13]. If, after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury, the court is left in reasonable doubts as to the verdicts, it is only where the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt, the court can conclude there was no miscarriage of justice (see also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [26] and [55]-[56]).

153I have reviewed the evidence above. There is no doubt there were difficulties with the evidence of the complainant. There was no evidence of the October abuse in her diary. Further, although she said she wrote to CW about everything that was going on in her life, she did not tell her of the nature of the sexual abuse alleged. 

154The complainant's diary entry of 30 September 1992 did not directly refer to the sexual abuse and she did not tell Belinda of the occurrence when she went to her home on that day. Further, none of the other diary entries after 30 September 1992 made reference to sexual abuse, nor did they refer to her disclosing the abuse to JS. In particular the diary entry of 18 August 1991, which she told the police contained a reference to telling JS about the abuse, contained no such reference, although it appears from the evidence of CW that she did speak to JS at some time. 

155Further, the diary entries of 18 August 1991 and 2 November 1991 indicate affection for the appellant and concern that he was leaving the home. Indeed, part of the diary entry of 30 September 1992 reflects the same concern.

156Having regard to the lapse of time I do not regard it as significant that the complainant was mistaken as to when the appellant and her mother ceased to share the same bedroom.

157The discrepancies in the complainant's evidence are of importance and tend to cast doubt on its reliability. Equally, the trial judge was entitled to accept that the diary notes of 30 September 1992 referred to sexual abuse and that she at least told CW that the appellant had engaged in some form of sexual activity with her. Further, the complainant evidently, from CW's evidence, had consulted JS about difficulties with her life in 1991 or 1994. Significantly the evidence of CW was that the appellant wanted to tell JS what was going on and she went to his office with her although she did not ultimately make a complaint.

158This was a case where the trial judge's assessment of the complainant was vital: see MFA v The Queen supra at [23]. It was open, in my opinion, for the trial judge to be satisfied of the reliability of the complainant on the critical issues having seen her give evidence, notwithstanding the matters to which I have referred to above. In particular, he was entitled to take into account the age of the complainant at the time of the events in assessing the diary entries, the possibility of confusion in speaking to JS and accept her evidence as to the meaning of the 30 September 1992 diary entry. It seems to me that any doubt which may exist as to the reasonableness of the verdict is resolved in this case by the advantage the trial judge had in seeing the complainant give her evidence.

159In these circumstances Ground 4 of the grounds of appeal has not been made out.

Conclusion

160In the result, leave to appeal against conviction should be granted but the appeal dismissed.

The sentence appeal

Ground 1

161The appellant was sentenced to the following limiting terms of imprisonment:

(a)Count 1 - A limiting term of 12 months to date from 8 March 2013 to expire on 7 March 2014.

(b)Counts 3 and 5 - On each count a limiting term of two years and 9 nine months to date from 3 March 2013 and to expire on 17 December 2015.

(c)Count 6 - A limiting term of 12 months to date from 8 September 2013 and to expire on 7 September 2014.

(d)Counts 8 and 10 - On each count a limiting term of 2 years and 9 months to date from 8 September 2013 and to expire on 7 June 2016.

162The total limiting term was thus 3 years and 3 months.

The remarks on sentence

163The trial judge said the offences were objectively serious. He pointed out they were committed on a 14 year old girl who was under the authority of the accused and that his actions amounted to a breach of the trust which was reposed in him.

164The trial judge accepted the submission that there was no evidence that the offences were planned or that the appellant either induced or threatened the complainant to engage in the sexual acts. He accepted that there was no request by the appellant of the complainant to not tell anyone about the incidents, nor apart from the acts themselves was there any conduct of a degrading nature. In the circumstances he accepted that the offences were at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness.

165The trial judge dealt with the accused's subjective circumstances. He found he had no relevant criminal record. He referred to the reports of Dr Bruce Westmore, Professor Susan Hayes and Dr Stephen Allnut which were tendered in evidence in the sentencing proceedings.

166His Honour noted that the appellant was one of seven children and had a good relationship with one of his brothers, TW, but not with his other siblings. He noted that the appellant left school aged 15 and did not complete a plumbing apprenticeship. He further noted the appellant was engaged in farm work until 1998 when he ceased to work fulltime and undertook commercial woodworking.

167The trial judge noted the appellant met the complainant's mother in the late 1980s and their marriage ended after 15 years. He stated that the accused had no relationship with the daughter of the marriage and that the accused had led a solitary life on a property at Kempsey.

168The trial judge referred to the opinion of Dr Westmore that the appellant was suffering from a significant anxiety disorder and a social phobia, together with paranoia and persecutory thought content relating to the trial process. He referred to the opinion of Dr Westmore that further psychiatric assessment was required.

169The trial judge also referred to the report of Professor Hayes that the accused also suffered panic attacks and had features of autism spectrum disorder, possibly Asberger's Syndrome. He also referred to the evidence of Dr Allnut that the appellant manifested an anxiety disorder in the form of social phobia with possibly underlying chronic psychotic beliefs derived from an undiagnosed low-grade psychotic disorder.

170In those circumstances the trial judge said in sentencing he had regard to the fact that the appellant suffered from significant psychiatric conditions and as a consequence the limiting term he imposed would not have a general deterrent effect. He also stated he had regard to the fact that due to his psychiatric conditions the appellant would have more difficulty serving time in custody. The trial judge also stated that on the appellant's release from custody he would have family support from his brother.

171Finally his Honour stated that he had regard to the maximum penalty for the offences at the time of their commission.

The parties' submissions 

172The appellant submitted that whilst the trial judge focused on the appellant's mental state at the time of determining the limiting term, he failed to take into account his likely mental state at the time of the offences.

173The appellant asserted that the possibility of Asberger's Syndrome referred to by Dr Westmore and Professor Hayes was a childhood brain disorder likely to have been present in 1992. He referred to the fact that Dr Westmore's report stated that he had been bullied at school and experienced auditory hallucinations. He also referred to the statement by Professor Hayes and Dr Allnut that as a result of school bullying he suffered anxiety and panic attacks as an adolescent which persisted and which, according to Dr Allnut's report, included blackouts. He also referred to the report of Dr Allnut to the effect that after the bullying and a head injury he developed learning difficulties.

174The appellant also referred to the statement contained in the report of Dr Allnut that he had seen a mental health worker at the age of 12 and that prior to 1987 he experienced auditory hallucinations and (according to the report of Dr Westmore) visual hallucinations.

175The appellant also referred to the statements in the reports that from 1997 he had delusional and paranoid thoughts regarding his conviction for cultivating and self-administering cannabis and had engaged in delusional and paranoid correspondence regarding his drug convictions.

176The appellant also submitted that the evidence of the complainant showed he was suffering from a mental incapacity at or about the time of the offences.

177Senior counsel for the appellant acknowledged this submission was not put at the sentencing hearing and that none of the doctors who examined the appellant stated he was under an incapacity at the time of the offences. She said that having regard to the difficulty in obtaining instructions, the failure to take the point at the sentencing hearing should not prevent it being taken in the appeal. She submitted that at the hearing the appellant's counsel did not deny its relevance.

178The Crown submitted that it was for the appellant to establish on the balance of probabilities that he was suffering from a mental disorder at the time and that it should be taken into account in a particular way.

179The Crown submitted, referring to Zreika v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [79]-[81], that this Court is a court of error and that there is a practical expectation that an offender's legal counsel will draw to the sentencing judge's attention factors which should be taken into account in mitigation. The Crown also referred to Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [36] which pointed out that the approach in Zreika v The Queen had been applied in circumstances where reliance was sought to be placed on appeal upon aspects of an offender's mental disorder which had been expressly eschewed by counsel at first instance.

Consideration

180In my opinion this ground is without merit. First, there can be no error of law in the judge failing to draw an inference that the offences were in some way related to the appellant's mental disorders when not only was he not asked to do so but as the Crown pointed out, reliance on that matter was expressly eschewed. Counsel for the appellant in the Court below accepted that there was no evidence that at the time of the offences the appellant was suffering from any of the above diagnosed mental disorders. At the trial the submission that was made with respect to the appellant's mental condition was that because his mental condition was diagnosed subsequently to the offences, the need for general deterrence was reduced. The trial judge in fact accepted the sentence would not have a general deterrent effect.

181More fundamentally, none of the doctors who presented reports suggested that the appellant's psychiatric disorder caused or contributed to the commission of the offences. In the absence of any such evidence it would have been inappropriate for the trial judge, much less for this Court, to speculate that this was the cause or contributed to the offending.

182It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 2

The parties' submissions

183The appellant did not contest the findings made by the trial judge but submitted on those findings a limiting term in each of the two sets of offences of 2 years and 9 months was excessive, and an overall term of 3 years and 3 months was manifestly excessive.

184The appellant accepted it was necessary to establish the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. He submitted that the reasons identified by his Honour together with his likely state of mental health at the time of the offences, led to the conclusion that the limiting term was manifestly excessive. He submitted that having regard to the lack of offending since 1992, the circumstances of the appellant and the age of the offences there was negligible risk of further offence.

185The appellant submitted that compared to the facts of EK v The Queen supra the length of the term was demonstrably excessive.

186The Crown emphasised it was not enough for the Court to simply substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge. The Crown pointed to the fact that the maximum penalty for the offence under s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act was 10 years and for the offence under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act was 7 years. It supplied statistics from the Judicial Commission of NSW which showed in respect of the s 66C(2) offences where there was a plea of not guilty, the custodial sentence was in the lower 12% of the range. In relation to the s 61M(1) offences, it pointed out that the sentences were in the bottom 6% of custodial sentences for all offenders of this offence. It also pointed out that the degree of accumulation was only 6 months. The Crown submitted it was inappropriate to determine this ground by comparison with just one other decision.

187The Crown also submitted that as the offences involved penile penetration, stating that the objective seriousness of the offences was at the lower end of the scale was generous.

188The Crown submitted the judge took all relevant matters into account and it submitted the sentences were not manifestly disproportionate.

Consideration

189Intervention on the ground of manifest inadequacy is justified only where the appellate court considers there must have been some misapplication of principle even though when or how is not apparent from the statement of reasons: House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505, Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6], Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [58], Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25] and Barbaro v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; (2014) 88 ALJR 372 at [26]. As was said in the joint judgment in Barbaro v The Queen this kind of error can also be described as the sentence imposed falling outside the range of sentences which could reasonably be imposed.

190To the extent that the appellant relied on the failure of the trial judge to take into account the appellant's mental condition at the time of the offences, I have already indicated that that ground should be rejected. The only other specific matter referred to by the appellant was the difference between the sentence imposed and the sentences imposed on the offender in EK v The Queen supra. It is inappropriate to determine this ground by comparison to a sentence imposed in one other case involving different facts and circumstances. This is particularly the case where the individual terms for the offences under s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act were not referred to in the judgment of this Court on which reliance is placed. The most that can be noted is that the limiting term for the offence under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act was double than that imposed by the sentencing judge in the present case. That is also of no assistance as the judge was misled as to the maximum penalty in that case. 

191However, guidance can be obtained from past sentencing patterns subject to the caution expressed by the High Court in Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [53]-[54] and by this Court in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [304]. 

192I have set out above the statistical information supplied by the Crown which shows that the sentences were well within the lower range of sentences imposed for offences of this nature.

193The offences in the present case involved sexual assault including penile penetration on an adolescent who, having regard to her diary entries, was plainly vulnerable. The classification of the offences in these circumstances in the lower range of objective seriousness was not ungenerous. There is nothing to suggest that after taking the matters which the sentencing judge referred to into account, the sentence was manifestly excessive.

194This ground of appeal should also be dismissed.

Orders

195In the result I would make the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal against conviction and sentence granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

196HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with the Chief Justice.

197BELLEW J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

2764386,Horne v R [2014] NSWCCA 133,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  I agree with Campbell J.
2RA HULME J:  I agree with Campbell J.
3CAMPBELL J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence of imprisonment passed on him in the District Court of New South Wales on 8th March 2013.  The term of imprisonment consists of a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 19th February 2013 and expiring on 18th February 2018 with an additional term of 3 years commencing on 19th February 2018 and expiring on 18th February 2021.
4The applicant's crime was supplying not less than 250 grams, a commercial quantity, of heroin, a prohibited drug, between 1st November 2008 and 2nd December 2008.  This offending was contrary to the provisions of s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
5The applicant was arrested on 2nd December 2008 and held in custody for 16 days before being granted bail on 18th of December 2008. He was not arraigned in the District Court until 6th of December 2012, when he entered a plea of guilty.  Notwithstanding this apparent long delay between arrest and entry of guilty plea, the Crown accepted at first instance that the plea of guilty was entered ""at the earliest possible opportunity"" (Tcpt 01/03/13, p 3(35)). A plea of guilty had earlier been entered in the Local Court on 13th April 2011 (see [36]-[40] below).
Explanation for delay 
6Much of the evidence against the applicant was in the form of recordings of lawfully intercepted telephone conversations.  The Crown informed the sentencing Judge both on 6th December 2012, when the applicant was arraigned and again on 1st March 2013, during proceedings on sentence, that there had ""always"" been an indication from the applicant that he would enter a plea of guilty, but the delay was due to the difficulty ""in quantifying the actual amount of drugs that the Crown [said] he was liable for"" (Tcpt p 3(40)).  This calculation required police officers to conduct a thorough analysis of all that had been recorded for the purpose of estimating quantities discussed as being supplied, which was time consuming.  
7I am not suggesting that anyone has been less than frank, but this cannot provide the whole explanation as that process was apparently completed prior to a co-offender, Mr Shellabear, being sentenced on 16th December 2011.
8The applicant was represented throughout the period and part of the delay, perhaps only the additional period of delay, may relate to negotiations on behalf of the applicant about the agreed facts forming the basis for his plea of guilty, and also over an issue of particular significance in this appeal, the degree of benefit he would obtain in return for assistance he provided to law enforcement agencies in respect of other, unrelated offending.  I will return to this point. 
The facts relevant to the applicant's offending
9The relevant facts were succinctly set out in the sentencing judge's reasons (ROS 1-3) in the following terms:
Horne and others were involved in a heroin distribution network around the Rozelle area. Horne was the local manager of the syndicate, although no doubt there were others above him in the network to whom he would pass on the profits from sales.
Police surveillance showed that Horne would regularly attend at the house of John Shellabear and regularly pick up money proceeds of sales from Shellabear. Shellabear packed the heroin into balloons, which were sold on the street. The most commonly used quantity was 0.2 of a gram, selling it for $100.
Shellabear employed a driver whom he would direct to various locations to make deliveries. Various runners and assistants were employed by Shellabear, although sometimes Shellabear would do the deliveries himself.
The delivery run took place from about midmorning until 9pm or so, mainly in and around the Rozelle and Balmain area.
The payments for the deliveries would go to the runners, thence to Shellabear, then to Horne once Shellabear's own costs had been met.
The activities of the offender Horne involved him in supplying 250 grams of heroin between the dates set out in the indictment - a period of just over one month. The actual quantum supplied is the minimum for designation as a ""commercial"" quantity, but I regard the structure of the overall operation as more significant than the actual amount attributed to the offender. Of course, I bear in mind the principle against double punishment but it is impossible to isolate the actual quantity specified from the broader picture of Horne's role in the network.
There were roughly eighty regular customers for the heroin.
The role played by Horne, particularly in his relationship with Shellabear, is revealed in various intercepted conversations, some of which are set out in exhibit SA. For example, on 5 November, Shellabear says: ""...that stuff's tops"". Horne says: ""Yeah, we will sell it"". Shellabear says: ""Yeah, I am selling it"". Horne says: ""Put some brown with it, sell it, put some brown with it"". (The ""brown"" was heroin sourced from Afghanistan.)
....
Again, for example, on 22 November 2008, a conversation at Shellabear's unit was recorded where Horne says, ""I guesstimate I have a hundred grand in stock, so that puts me two grand in front...""
Horne worked closely with Shellabear in the operation. On the afternoon of the 22nd, there was another conversation at the Terry Street unit where there was talk about supplying some amount of heroin to a person called Doug - a runner or user or both. Horne  says: ""What's uggy Dougy usually have... an ounce?"" Shellabear says"" ""Oh mate, just make him fucking one of each, three points"".
Horne is present when or soon after ""Dougy"" injects himself: ""How's that feel mate?"" Doug says: ""Oh, clean ... it felt the same going in ... Nice, yeah, nice.""
Horne and Shellabear were arrested simultaneously on 2 December 2008. 
The applicant's personal circumstances
10The applicant was born on the 23rd of May 1978, making him 30 years old at the time he offended and 34 when he was sentenced.  He had no criminal record. The sentencing Judge accepted he was genuinely contrite.  This finding was based upon the view the sentencing Judge formed of the significance of the guilty plea; the assistance given to authorities; the evidence of a character witness (John Chalk) who was a local businessman and respected member of the community; and the evidence of the applicant's wife.  The character witness gave evidence that the applicant was regretful.
11From the evidence of the character witness, the applicant's wife and Mr Watson-Munro, a psychologist, the sentencing Judge accepted that the applicant had a sad, difficult and disrupted childhood.  There were difficulties with his parents. His father was a shift worker and his mother was an absent alcoholic who abandoned him when the applicant was two and a half years of age.  Because of the trouble with his parents, his grandparents took him in at that early age.  
12The applicant had a good record of work as a merchant seaman. When he offended, apparently, he was in a financial position to live off his investments.  He and his wife had been together for 13 years and had one child.  Since his release on bail, the applicant had been working in the business of his father-in-law, which work would be available to him upon his release from prison.  
13Good family support, a strong marriage, the prospect of employment upon release, and his genuine remorsefulness indicated to the sentencing judge good prospects of rehabilitation.  But his Honour was not persuaded by the evidence of Mr Watson-Munro, and a specialist neurologist, that the applicant was suffering from a significant brain injury or any relevant mental illness. 
Assistance to the authorities
14Part of the proceedings on sentence on 1st March 2013, were conducted in a closed Court.  Oral evidence was called, exhibits tendered and argument addressed to the assistance the applicant had rendered authorities.  I have carefully read the confidential exhibits, the transcript of proceedings, and the sentencing judge's supplementary confidential judgment on sentence regarding this matter.  
15The assistance supplied by the applicant related to the exposure of a corrupt public official.  The applicant gave evidence at a commission of inquiry and provided a statement to police, but there was some delay in signing the statement. This delay was the subject of some debate before the sentencing judge and on appeal.
16When the statement was eventually signed the applicant received an indemnity in respect of other offending involving the corrupt official.
17It is clear from the confidential exhibits that the applicant attempted to negotiate a definite and agreed advantage relating to this present offending, which the law enforcement authorities refused.  Those negotiations explain why the applicant delayed signing his witness statement and providing the undertaking he eventually gave to give evidence.  No doubt he was attempting to use these considerations to his advantage in his dealings with the law enforcement agencies involved.    
18As a result, at least partially, of the applicant's assistance, including signing the statement and undertaking to give evidence, the corrupt official pleaded guilty.  No trial was necessary and no future assistance is expected, or required.
Reasons for sentence
19Notwithstanding the brief period covered by the applicant's offending, the sentencing judge found the charge to be serious ""justifying nothing other than a significant sentence of imprisonment"".  It was planned criminality and the applicant's involvement called for an emphasis on both specific and general deterrence in the form of a ""substantial prison sentence"".  The mitigating factors including the difficulties of the applicant's childhood ""[do] not justify or even explain serious and socially damaging misconduct of this kind"".
20As I have previously recorded, the sentencing judge found that the applicant was the local manager of the heroin distribution network, he was not the principal, but he was senior to the identified co-offenders, including in particular Mr Shellabear.  The other identified co-offenders were Rhook, who seemed to be the applicant's lieutenant, McGann, Hannah, Loule and Hunter.  The latter four were ""runners"" in the operation and had received lesser sentences.
21The sentencing judge found, at least implicitly, that the applicant's motivation for engagement in the enterprise was greed.  However, he ""was not the ultimate recipient of the lion's share of the proceeds"".  He ""funnelled"" profits to those above him.  His Honour found there was no evidence of any grand lifestyle nor accumulated assets from his offending.
Parity
22The sentencing Judge found that Shellabear was the most relevant comparator for parity purposes.  He had been sentenced by Blanch J, CJDC, in December 2011.  His offending involved a larger amount, 600 grams and he was involved for a longer period.  Blanch J sentenced Shellabear on the basis that the applicant was running the operation.  Part of Shellabear's involvement was explained by the need to feed his own addiction.  He had remained in custody since his arrest and had already undertaken a number of courses which demonstrated remorsefulness and insight, supporting a finding that the prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable.  
23Shellabear's plea was regarded as ""early"" on the same basis as the applicant's.  He was imprisoned for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5.
24In assessing the question of parity, the sentencing judge did not mention the greater quantity of drugs or longer period of offending in the case of Shellabear.
Findings as to assistance
25On the evidence received in the closed Court, the sentencing judge was satisfied that the applicant had discharged the burden of engaging s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Procedure Act).  His Honour accepted the applicant gave a belated, but significant undertaking to give evidence; he was legitimately fearful for his life; notwithstanding the delay in signing his statement, his co-operation ""was real and significant""; and his assistance ""was beneficial in securing a guilty plea"" from the corrupt public official.
26His Honour indicated that but for the guilty plea and assistance he would have imposed a head sentence of imprisonment of 13 years.  He allowed ""a combined discount of approximately 38 per cent"" reducing ""the hypothetical sentence"" from 13 years to 8.  He apportioned that reduction of 5 years between the plea and the assistance in terms of 2 years and 9 months for the former, and 2 years and 3 months for the latter.
27The confidential judgment also recorded a finding of special circumstances based upon the combination of considerations that this was the applicant's first time in prison and the likelihood that his imprisonment would be harsher than usual because of his assistance.
28As the applicant's submissions point out, his Honour's apportionment represents a discount of 21 per cent for the plea, and 17 per cent for the assistance.  This was contrary to an indication his Honour had given during the proceedings that he would ""allow him 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty"" Tcpt p12(20) -(25).
Grounds of appeal
29The applicant raised the following grounds of appeal:
Ground 1: In providing a discount on sentence as a consequence of the applicant's plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities his Honour erred:(a)  in failing to provide a discount for the utilitarian value of the   early plea of guilty; or,(b) in the alternative, providing an inadequate discount for the utilitarian value of the plea by including a component for the applicant's contrition and his assistance in the administration of justice.
Ground 2: The nominated combined discount of 38% for the applicant's plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities was inadequate.
Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to properly take into account:(a)  The applicant's genuine remorse;(b)  The relevance of the extensive delay in finalising proceedings; and(c)  The evidence of the applicant's rehabilitation.
Ground 4: His Honour erred in concluding that the appropriate sentence, but for the plea and the promised assistance, should have been imprisonment for 13 years.
Ground 5: The sentence imposed upon the applicant is manifestly excessive.
30Although not so expressed, Ground 4 was argued as ""a parity point"".
Grounds 1 and 2 - the combined discount
31The applicant argued these grounds more or less together.  The essential points made on behalf of the applicant were that it was not clear that his Honour allowed an explicit discount for the ""utilitarian value of the plea"" given his reference to ""genuine contrition and some assistance to the administration of justice"".  The latter concept is said to have been derived from s 22A Sentencing Procedure Act dealing with conduct different from the entry of a plea; it was wrong to include an express discount for the considerations of contrition or remorse; and the discount was less than his Honour had indicated during argument, leading to practical injustice.
32Concerning ground 2, the applicant submitted that in the light of the sentencing Judge's other findings, if the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea should have been 25 percent, the combined discount should have been greater than 38 percent.
33The Crown argued that his Honour's approach was consistent with the legislation; that if one made the stated discount for assistance first and then a discount for the plea, the reduction for the plea could be seen to be ""slightly more than 25 percent"".  The Crown seemed to accept that his Honour had included the element of contrition in the stated combined discount.  In the alternative, it was argued, that the indication given during argument of 25 percent for the plea was ""generous"" and there was no practical injustice in the sentencing Judge moderating that view in the sentence actually passed.  
34Section 22 Sentencing Procedure Act  provides for a discount for a plea of guilty.  The principles arising out of R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and subsequent cases are conveniently summarised by Howie J in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32].  Relevantly for present purposes they include that the actual discount for the utilitarian value of a plea is determined largely by its timing; and that there is no component in the discount for remorse, nor is there to be a separately quantified discount for remorse.  At point 9 of [32] of his Honour's summary, Howie J said (omitting citations):
The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain; or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown; or the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage; such as having matters put on a Form 1. 
However, as explained at below (at [36]-[42]), these principles do not apply to this case.
35It was permissible for the sentencing judge to arrive at a combined overall discount:  R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38; (2012) 219 A Crim R 415 at [11] per Basten JA; at [35] per Adams J.  Reductions in sentence for assistance to the authorities are dealt with by s 23, Sentencing Procedure Act, the provisions of which, of course, must be complied with.  However, as Basten JA pointed out at [11]:
........the inference (implicit though not expressed) that it is incorrect to add the discounts, so as to achieve a single global figure applied to the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed, should not be assumed without demonstration. No authority or statutory support for the adoption of one approach rather than another was relied on in the cases noted above. Nor does s 23 necessarily require either process to the exclusion of the other. For example, for the Court to state the penalty which it would ""otherwise have imposed"" no doubt refers to the appropriate penalty disregarding only the assistance to authorities. It says nothing as to the manner in which the discounting is to be achieved. Indeed, on one view, the manner in which it is achieved is irrelevant: the selected reduction can be expressed in a number of different ways, none of which is prohibited.
The Crown's argument that if his Honour were taken to have applied a separate discount for the guilty plea, and after the discount for assistance, the discount for the plea is 25 per cent should be rejected.  If a sentencing Court decides to give effect to s 22 and s 23 separately, rather than in combination, a common practice is to apply the discount for the plea of guilty first:  R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195 at [30] per Hodgson JA and at [47] per Simpson J; SZ v R (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 at [9] - [11] per Howie J; Ehrlich at [70] per Johnson J (albeit in dissent). Ehrlich establishes that no one approach is to be preferred.
36After judgment was reserved, the Court directed the Registrar to write to counsel drawing their attention to the provisions of the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008 (NSW) (""the 2008 Act""), repealed on 13 March 2012 but with a continued limited operation under Schedule 2, cl 62D(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which states: 
62D Continued operation of sentencing discount arrangements
(1) Part 4 (Sentences-guilty pleas) of the repealed Act continues to apply (as if it had not been repealed) to and in respect of the sentencing of an offender on or after the repeal date in proceedings for an offence to which the repealed Act applied immediately before the repeal date ....
37In supplementary submissions, the parties acknowledged that the 2008 Act applied, and continues to apply, to these proceedings.  However, its provisions were not drawn to the attention of the sentencing judge by counsel appearing on the proceedings on sentence, nor referred to in his Honour's reasons.  
38In cases to which it applies, ss 16 and 17 of the 2008 Act provided for the allowance of a discount on sentence for a guilty plea.  These sections provided, so far as is relevant:  
16 Sentencing for certain indictable offences taking into account guilty plea
(1) In passing sentence for an indictable offence on an offender who has pleaded guilty, a sentencing court:
(a) must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the penalty it would have imposed but for the guilty plea, and(b) must allow a discount on the sentence for the guilty plea in accordance with section 17(1) and may allow a discount in accordance with section 17(2) or (4).
(2) A discount for a guilty plea, in relation to an offence, means a discount for:
(a) the saving in resources and time that would otherwise be expended in a trial for the offence but for the guilty plea, and(b) the avoidance of the additional trauma to the victim that might be caused by a trial for the offence, and(c) the contrition that the sentencing court considers that the offender demonstrates by pleading guilty, and(d) any other benefit associated with or demonstrated by the guilty plea....(8) Sections 21A (3) (k) and 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 do not apply to the passing of a sentence to which this section applies.
(9) A discount for a guilty plea is not to exceed the applicable limits provided in section 17. 
17 Discount for guilty plea
(1) If an offender pleaded guilty to an offence at any time before being committed for sentence, the sentencing court must allow a discount for the guilty plea calculated as follows:
(a) if the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term-a term that is 25% less than the term the court would otherwise have imposed....
39Both parties accepted that s 17(1)(a) left no room for discretionary reduction in the amount of the discount allowable: a discount of 25% was fixed by the express terms of the statute and was mandatory.  Further, there was no error in referring to contrition as an element of the discount: s 16(2)(c).
40The Act applied to this case because, as JusticeLink records, a plea of guilty was accepted in the Downing Centre Local Court on 13th April 2011, and on that day an order was made committing the applicant for sentence in the District Court.  By s 4 of the 2008 Act, it applied only to indictable offences for which committal proceedings were heard in the Local Court sitting at the Downing Centre, Sydney, and Central, Sydney.  
41His Honour's expression of the discount for the guilty plea as in part ""representing ... genuine contrition"" was perfectly proper, even if he did not expressly refer to the 2008 Act.  As defined by s16(2) of the 2008 Act a discount for a guilty plea extended to contrition, and Borkowski did not apply. A consideration of his sentencing reasons as a whole shows that his Honour must have had the provisions of ss 16 and 17 in mind.  However, by dint of s 17, the sentencing judge was required, in the circumstances of this case to allow a 25 percent discount and he did not do so.  It is clear from his reasons that his Honour allowed only a 21 percent discount ""attributable to the plea of guilty"".  The Crown argument that the judgment can be construed as making an allowance for a discount of 25 percent should be rejected.  As the sentencing judge ""was bound to state the reasons for arriving at the decision reached, the reasons actually stated are to be understood as recording steps that were in fact taken in arriving at that result"":  Waterways Authority v Fitzgibbon & Ors. [2005] HCA 57; 79 ALJR 1816 at [130] per Hayne J.  Given what is made explicit in his Honour's reasons no question of construction arises.  Moreover, contrary to the argument on behalf of the Crown, given the requirements of the statute, no question about a 25 percent discount being ""generous"" can arise.  
42It follows that Ground 1 has been made out.
43It is not necessary to address the argument that fixing a discount less than that indicated in argument involved procedural unfairness.  
44The applicant's complaint about the discount allowed for assistance to authorities is largely consequential upon the error (which I accept) in relation to the discount for the plea of guilty. Once it is recognised that the sentencing Judge allowed 21 percent and not 25 percent, the total permissible discount should have been higher.  Assuming for the moment that a discount equivalent to 17 percent of the notional starting sentence was warranted for assistance then the total discount in real terms ought to have been 42 percent. 
45The Crown relied upon the passage from SZ referred to above.  The Crown also pointed to the delay in the applicant providing his signature to the statement and his undertaking to give evidence, and to the benefit he otherwise received by way of indemnity, to argue that a combined discount of 38 percent  was appropriate. No error was disclosed.
46I accept that there was no error in an additional discount in the order of 17 percent for assistance, however, in my judgment that factor should have been added to the appropriate discount of 25 percent for the plea of guilty to produce a combined discount of 42 percent.
Ground 3
47This ground relates to an argument that in carrying out the necessary instinctive synthesis, the sentencing judge failed to have regard to genuine remorse, delay in finalisation of the proceedings and evidence of the applicant's rehabilitation. As I understood the argument the complaint about delay as a separate consideration was pressed but diffidently in this Court. However, the Judge referred to delay and may be taken to have given it some weight.  Moreover, to some extent, the delay worked to the applicant's forensic advantage and enabled him to negotiate the indemnity in respect of the other offending in exchange for his assistance; and allowed him to be sentenced on a more favourable basis than his main co-offender by virtue of the identification by the prosecution of his reduced involvement in terms of amount and period.
48His Honour did have regard to remorse and rehabilitation:  he accepted the evidence of Mr Chalk that the applicant was regretful and had demonstrated a change in attitude; that his remorse was genuine; and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.  There is no reason to suppose that his Honour did not give some weight to each of these matters in the necessary instinctive synthesis. The question of what weight to give is generally a matter for the sentencing court rather than this Court. I would reject Ground 3.
Ground 4 - parity; ground 5 manifest excess
49The ground of appeal as formulated does not refer to the principle of parity, but it is clear from the written and oral argument that this is the gravamen of the applicant's complaint.  
50At the sentencing (Tcpt p 23(5)-(25)) and on appeal, it was argued that, on balance, there was no real distinction between Shellabear and the applicant and accordingly that the starting point for the sentence imposed upon Shellabear by Blanch J of about 10 years and 4 months, should have applied to the applicant.
51Reference was also made to Fong v R [2011] NSWCCA 283; JMS v R [2010] NSWCCA 229; and Burns v R [2010] NSWCCA 279.  Taken together, these decisions were said to demonstrate that his Honour's starting point of 13 years was plainly unreasonable.  
52The Crown argued that the degree of differentiation in the commencing point for the sentences of the applicant as opposed to Mr Shellabear was justified on the basis of the applicant's superior role in the drug syndicate. This finding was as well open to the sentencing judge, as it had been to Blanch J in the case of Shellabear. The Crown reminded the Court of the importance of the principle discussed in Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665; [1999] HCA 29 at [15] that mere disagreement with the sentence imposed below does not justify the appellate court's intervention.
53For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that the parity principle requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner.  But it ""allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances"":  Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at 473 [28] per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.  It was open for the learned sentencing Judge to find that the applicant was superior to Shellabear in the drug syndicate.  It is true, that he did not expressly refer to the evidence of Shellabear's greater involvement in terms of quantity and time, and that those factors may have been relevant differences in culpability which would have justified treating them alike for the purpose of fixing a starting point.  But this consideration did not demand it, and the applicant's ""higher level"" of involvement of itself justified differentiation between them notwithstanding all else that could be said in favour of one, or the other, going to culpability and personal circumstances.  
54I do not think parity demanded adopting the same notional starting point. But the considerations that they were both ""actively hands on"" in the operation, and the applicant was not the ultimate recipient of the lion's share of the proceeds, when examined in the light of Shellabear's greater involvement persuade me that there is disparity in the selection of the respective notional starting points, which is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words, ""to give the appearance that justice has not been done"": Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609 - 610 per Gibbs CJ.  In coming to this conclusion, I have referred to what I regard as objective criteria.  I do not regard the degree of difference in the starting points in this case as justified by differences between the applicant and Shellabear.  Save for Shellabear's involvement to feed his drug habit, which may be an explanation for his offending rendering it somewhat less culpable than naked greed, such differences as there are between them in terms of subjective circumstances might generally be taken to favour the applicant.
55The applicant's more senior level of involvement justified a higher starting point than that adopted in respect of Shellabear, but not as high as that selected by the learned sentencing Judge which was more than 2 years and 6 months higher than Shellabear.  I am satisfied that Ground 4 has been made good.  
56Given that there are identifiable appellable errors in his Honour's approach, it is unnecessary to consider whether the sentence passed is otherwise manifestly excessive as asserted by Ground 5.
Re-sentence
57As I have accepted the sentencing Judge made errors as asserted in Ground 1 and Ground 4, it is necessary to consider whether any other sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3), Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  Once it is accepted that there are errors of principle giving rise to disparity between the applicant and Shellabear, and in the sentencing judge's approach to the discount that should have been applied for the plea of guilty, it seems to me well nigh inevitable, that on the facts as found by the sentencing Judge some other and lesser sentence should have been imposed.
58For my part I would make all of the findings of fact made by the sentencing Judge as set out above, but I would adopt a notional starting point of 11 years 6 months for the applicant, rather than the 10 years and 4 months apparently adopted for Shellabear by Blanch J.  This difference, I think appropriately reflects the differences in culpability and circumstances between them flowing mainly from the applicant's more senior role in the syndicate.  
59From this starting point of 11 years and 6 months, I would make a combined discount in real terms of 42 percent, 25 percent referable to the plea of guilty in the Local Court and 17 percent, as assessed by the sentencing Judge, for assistance to law enforcement authorities.
60Allowing the 25 percent discount for the utilitarian value only of the plea of guilty would produce a term of around 8 years and 8 months before the application of s 23, Sentencing Procedure Act.  In accordance with s 23(4), I propose to impose a lesser penalty because the offender has assisted law enforcement authorities.  Given the corrupt official's plea of guilty, no question arises in the present case about future assistance.   As I have said, the discount I intend to allow is 17 per cent of my notional starting point.  In broad terms this equates to a reduction of about 2 years.  In my judgment this lesser penalty is not unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence in accordance with the findings of the sentencing Judge which I have adopted, for the purpose of s 23(3), Sentencing Procedure Act.
61 His Honour's finding of special circumstances was based upon a combination of factors being that this is his first time in custody, and the harsher conditions in which the applicant will serve his sentence.  Each of these matters has been taken into account elsewhere.  The fact that this is the applicant's first time in custody, by implication, may have been taken into account in extending some leniency on the basis of his good character as evinced by the absence of any prior criminal convictions.  The harsher conditions in which he will serve his time of imprisonment may be implicitly recognised by the discount provided for assistance to authorities.  Double counting, of course, should be avoided: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18].  It is for this reason I have emphasised the combination of circumstances.
62To the factors found by the sentencing Judge I would add the progress already made by the applicant towards reform and rehabilitation and the good prospects of that continuing if he is released on parole.
63The sentencing Judge applied a ratio of 62.5 percent in the sentence imposed by him.  I agree that that ratio is appropriate.  
64I have given earnest consideration to the question of whether the non-parole component of the sentence I propose is disproportionate to the applicant's offending and I am satisfied that it is not.  Fong (and his co-offenders Chow and Wong), JMS, and Byrnes are comparable prior sentences which provide something of a yardstick.  Applying it to the present case, I do not regard the non-parole period I have proposed as disproportionate: for what it is worth, the various offending in those cases seems worse than this case, and the circumstances of the offenders less compelling. I accept the sample is too small to demonstrate anything in the nature of a trend, but the range of non-parole periods actually imposed on six offenders whose sentences are discussed in those cases is 3 to 5 years.  
65I would fix a non-parole period 4 years and 2 months with an additional term of 2 years and 6 months. The total term is 6 years and 8 months. 
66The orders I propose are:
(1)Leave to appeal granted.
(2)Appeal allowed.
(3)Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court on 8th March 2013 and instead sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment having a non parole period of 4 years and 2 months commencing on 19th February 2013 and expiring on 18th April 2017, and an additional term of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 19th April 2017 and expiring on 18th October 2019.  The earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 19th April 2017.
(4)Pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), the Court orders the information contained in the confidential judgment of the sentencing court delivered on 8th March 2013, the references to the evidence taken in closed court and the submissions about the subject matter of that judgment not be published.
(5)Order (4) is made on the grounds identified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of s 8 of the Act as necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice and the safety of the applicant.

2764391,New South Wales Crime Commission v Co [2014] NSWSC 999,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1HAMILL J:  This is an application by the New South Wales Crime Commission for a restraining order under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). 
2The application came before me in chambers yesterday at which time I indicated to the plaintiff that I was of the opinion that such an application was more appropriately dealt with in open court.  If there was any necessity for non-publication orders, or for closure of the court, the Court was in a position to make such orders so as to ensure the integrity of any ongoing investigation and the efficacy of the restraining order sought. 
3For reasons I have given in a similar case which I have just disposed of, it is my opinion that contrary to the decisions of some members of the court, reasons, albeit brief reasons, should be given in cases of this kind: see International Finance Trust Company Limited v New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] NSWCA 291; New South Wales Crime Commission v Richards [2010] NSWSC 1399; New South Wales Crime Commission v Younan [2012] NSWSC 13, cf New South Wales Crime Commission v Meads [2010] NSWSC 1145. 
4The application is to be dealt with ex parte under the provisions of s 10A(1).  However ss (4) allows the court to require the Commission to give notice of the application to any person who may be affected by the restraining orders proposed. 
5I have come to the conclusion, based on the material before me, that the circumstances are such that a notice is or should not be required.  My reason for coming to that conclusion is simply that the ease with which the relevant property could be disposed of, if the defendant became aware of the application, is such as it could thwart the very purpose of the orders sought.
6The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Sparks, dated 22 July 2014.  Mr Sparks is an authorised officer, as that expression is defined in s 4 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.  His affidavit sets out his belief that the defendant has engaged in serious crime related activity, within the meaning that that phrase is given in the legislation.  That activity is drug related activity and particularly the supply of drugs under the Drugs (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985 (NSW).  Those offences, with which the defendant currently stands charged, falls within the definition of a serious criminal offence. 
7Mr Sparks has annexed a facts sheet prepared by the investigating police and I have read that facts sheet and observed that the case against the defendant is encompassed by surveillance of his premises during which two men appear to enter and leave the premises from which an inference might be drawn that they had made a significant drug transaction with the defendant.  Thereafter, the police executed a search warrant of those premises and located around 30 kilograms of cannabis and about $104,000 in Australian currency. 
8When the defendant was interviewed by police, it is said in the facts sheet that he told the police that he found the cannabis ""on the side of the road"" and that he intended to use it for his personal use.  I note again the quantity of 30 kilograms. 
9For the purposes of s 10A(5) I consider that the suspicion deposed to by Mr Sparks in his affidavit is one based on reasonable grounds and, accordingly I ""must"" make the order in accordance with the terms of s 10A.  I note, in doing so, that the plaintiff, through Ms Goh has made undertakings as to damages or costs in relation to the making and operation of the order, so that the discretionary power to refuse to make the order under ss 7 does not arise.
10In addition to the application for the restraining order, the plaintiff also seeks ancillary orders under s 12 of the Act.  Those orders encompass his compulsory examination before the Registrar of this court as well as a requirement that he provide a statement verified on oath as to his interests in property. 
11As I indicated in the previous case, New South Wales Crime Commission v Pham [2014] NSWSC 998, there is no particular urgency surrounding the ancillary orders sought.  In my opinion the application for such orders can be made at a later time.  12I am also of the opinion that the defendant should be on notice of such an application so that he can chose to make submissions in relation to whether orders should be made in circumstances where he stands charged with criminal offences.
13Ms Goh, who appears for the plaintiff, has helpfully and properly brought to my attention the decision of New South Wales Crime Commission v Martin [2013] NSWSC 15, in which McDougall J took a similar approach in declining to make the ancillary orders. 
14However, for the reasons that I have given, I propose to make the restraining orders as sought and the other orders in the proposed orders, that is, orders 5, 6 and 7. 
15I make orders in accordance with the amended orders.  I have initially and signed those orders and they will be made forthwith.

		28 July 2014",2014-07-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764392,New South Wales Crime Commission v Pham [2014] NSWSC 998,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1HAMILL J:  This is an application principally under s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) for restraining orders with respect to the property of the defendant. 
2The defendant is currently charged with an offence which fits the description of a drug trafficking offence under the definition in s 6 of the Act. 
3The order is sought in respect of any interest in property of the defendant and specifically encompasses certain real estate which is nominated in Schedule 1 to the proposed orders.
4As I did in argument, I should indicate for the record that the case came before me in chambers yesterday, Wednesday 23 July, 2014.  Ms Goh attended in chambers on behalf of the plaintiff and she informed me, when I asked, that different judges had different practices as to whether matters such as this should be dealt with in chambers or in court.  I took the view then, and take the view now, that it is more appropriate for applications like this to be dealt with in court.  If cogent reasons exist to restrict the publication of material raised in the course of such an application, or if reasons exist to close the court, orders can be made to ensure that any necessary secrecy or privacy is maintained. 
5Accordingly I indicated to Ms Goh that I would deal with the matter in court this morning and that it would receive appropriate priority, which it has. 
6Section 10A allows the Commission to make an application for a restraining order as defined in s 10 and to do so in an application made ex parte to the court.  Sub-section 4 allows the court ""if it thinks fit"" to require the Commission to give notice to any person who may be affected by the orders sought.  In view of the material before me and, in particular, the material that establishes that the property encompassed by the proposed order could be quickly disposed of if the defendant became aware of the application, I am of the opinion that the Commission ought not to be required to notify the defendant of the application. 
7Accordingly, I have considered the matter on an ex parte basis as contemplated by s 10A.
8A third preliminary question arises as to whether or not it is necessary, in an application of this kind, for the court to give reasons for its decision.  Ms Goh has provided me with authorities of this Court and the Court of Appeal which go both ways on that question.  A majority of the Court of Appeal in International Finance Trust Company Limited v New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] NSWCA 291 held that it was necessary for the Court to give reasons.  However, since that decision in 2008 there have been amendments to the legislation and Ms Goh informs me that some judges of this Division take the view that those amendments make it unnecessary to provide reasons; see New South Wales Crime Commission v Meads [2010] NSWSC 1145.
9In the case of New South Wales Crime Commission v Richards [2010] NSWSC 1399, McCallum J took the contrary view.  Her Honour held that International Finance Trust remained good law in spite of the amendments and declined to follow the decision in Meads.
10In New South Wales Crime Commission v Younan [2012] NSWSC 13 Davies J took a similar approach and preferred the reasons given by McCallum J.  In my opinion reasons should be given for making a decision of this kind.  I refer to the reasons articulated by McCallum J in Richards at paragraph 12.  However, as Allsop P said in International Finance Trust at [47], such reasons need not be ""elaborate"".  They may be stated with ""economy and conciseness"".
11I turn then to the substance of the matter.  In support of the application for the restraining order, the plaintiff reads an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark.  Annexed to that affidavit is a statement of facts, as well as a series of emails between the deponent and the investigating police officers.  It is unnecessary to recount the facts in detail.  It is sufficient to know that, according to the facts sheet, the defendant was associated with certain premises which were subject to a police search on 15 January 2014, at which time a relatively elaborate hydroponic cannabis cultivating system was located. 
12In addition, police executed a search warrant on the defendant's home where they located a sum of cash in a wardrobe in the defendant's bedroom.  The subsequent investigations led them to a third premises which were searched and they found further cannabis plants.  The defendant's fingerprints were located on a lamp shade within those premises. 
13The deponent to the supporting affidavit indicates that he believes in the truth of the fact sheet and also the truth of things said to him by investigating police in the email to which I have referred. On the basis of that material Mr Spark indicates that he has a suspicion, both that the defendant engaged in serious crime related activity, and that certain property in her name and found in her possession was derived from that activity. 
14For the purposes of ss 5, and for the reasons that I have given, I consider that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion deposed to by Mr Spark and, accordingly, the sub-section, which is in mandatory terms, requires that ""I must"" make a restraining order and I propose to do so. 
15The summons seeking the order, and the orders drafted, also seek a number of ""ancillary orders"" pursuant to s 12 to the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.  In particular, the plaintiff seeks orders that the defendant be examined on oath and that she provide a statement verified on oath setting out the particulars which are articulated in Schedule 2 to the proposed orders.  Those details concern her assets, and so forth.
16Ms Goh, with commendable frankness, has indicated again that different judges take different approaches as to whether ancillary orders should be made at the time of making ex parte orders under s 10A.  I have to say that there seems to be no doubt on the face of the legislation, particularly s 12, that the court has power to do so. That reads: ""The Supreme Court may, when it makes a restraining order or at any later time, make any ancillary orders....""
17There is no question that that provides the Court with power to make the ancillary order, but again, as Ms Goh says with commendable frankness, it is a discretionary matter. 
18Ms Goh also brought to my attention, when the matter was before me in chambers, a decision of McDougall J in New South Wales Crime Commission v Peter Geoffrey Martin [2013] NSWSC 15, in which his Honour declined to make ancillary orders as those proposed here.  His Honour did not give extensive reasons, other than to note that the application could be pressed at a later time.
19As I have said, the question of whether I should make ancillary orders is a discretionary matter and in my opinion the urgency which attends the application for the restraining order, and which means that it is appropriate that the matter be dealt with without notice to the defendant, does not attend the application for the ancillary orders. 
20 As Ms Goh has conceded, the plaintiff can make application for those orders at any time and she indicated to me, again in chambers yesterday, that the likelihood is that any such examination would not take place in the near future. 
21In my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, if orders for examination and compulsory provision of a statement of the kind contemplated, the defendant should be put on notice of the application and have a right to be heard in respect of it.  This accords with the approach taken by McDougall J in Martin. 
22I am grateful to Ms Goh for bringing that case to my attention and her doing so reflects the balance with which she has conducted the application. 
23I note that the Commission has, through Ms Goh, made an undertaking as to the payment of damages or costs in relation to the operation of the orders that I will make. 
24Accordingly the discretionary power to refuse to make such an order under sub-section (7) of s 10A does not arise. Accordingly, I propose to make orders 1, 5, 6 and 7.  I will not make orders 3 or 4. 
25I make orders in accordance with the hand-written amended orders proposed by the plaintiff.  I have initialled the amendments and signed the document.  It will be sealed and those orders should be made forthwith.

		28 July 2014",2014-07-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764393,The State of New South Wales v Brooker [2014] NSWSC 995,"ex tempore Judgment

1HAMILL J: This is an application for orders under s 10A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act). The orders sought are for interim supervision orders of the defendant. Such orders can be made by the court where it appears that the defendant's current custody or supervision will expire before the proceedings are finally determined and that the matters alleged in supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order.

2I am satisfied of the first of those matters and, indeed, the defendant is already subject to an interim supervision order made by his Honour Justice Harrison on 24 June 2014.

3As to making any assessment of the second matter, I need to go back to s 9 of the legislation to determine whether or not, on the material before me, a final order would be justified. The criteria are in s 9(3) of the Act and include the safety of the community and require the court to take into account the results of any assessments, and particularly risk assessments made by qualified medical practitioners or psychologists. There is a body of material already filed on behalf of the State of New South Wales but it is only necessary for me to refer to an affidavit of Samuel Ardasinski and the associated report prepared by him.

4As I have said by way of background, Justice Harrison made orders on 24 June 2014 and those orders were in the same, or more or less the same terms as those that I am invited to make today. Mr Hammond appears instructed by New South Wales Crown Solicitor's Office on behalf of the plaintiff and he also mentions the matter on behalf of the defendant, whose lawyers have indicated that they consent to either a continuation of those orders made by Justice Harrison or to any orders of an interim nature that are now sought.

5The material in the psychologist's report and risk assessment need not be gone into in any great detail, but I think I should indicate that the defendant is a seventy year old man and he has a lengthy criminal history. In particular, he has a history including a number of sexual offences, including sexual offences committed against children. Those offences have occurred in at least three States of the Commonwealth, namely New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland. His first sexual offence occurred when he was eighteen years of age and he has from time to time committed sexual offences throughout his entire adult life. At one stage he absconded on parole from New South Wales and, whilst in breach of that parole, was convicted of sexual offending in Western Australia.

6The report to which I have referred sets out the details of those offences and provides a detailed risk assessment based upon a variety of factors, including that sexual and criminal history as outlined, the defendant's response to supervision in the past, the programs that he has undertaken by reference to a number of acknowledged risk assessment processes and criteria. Whilst the various tools that are used are by no means perfect, the consistent theme from the risk assessments made by the psychologist are that the defendant presents a high risk of committing further offences of a sexual nature.

7If the history to which I have referred and the psychologist's opinion as to the risk assessment is proved to the satisfaction of the judge hearing the application for an extended supervision order, clearly such an order would be justified. In those circumstances the provision in s 10A is engaged and I may, and in my opinion I should, make an interim order of the kind sought.

8The Court orders that:

(1)Pursuant to section 10A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (""the Act""), the defendant be subject to a further interim supervision order to take effect from 30 July 2014, for a period of 28 days. 

(2)Pursuant to section 11 of the Act, the defendant is directed, for the period of the interim supervision order, to comply with the conditions set out in the schedule of the Summons.

(3)The matter be listed on 20 August 2014 for the plaintiff to apply for a further interim supervision order referred to in Order 1.

(4)Liberty to apply to relist the matter on one days notice.

		28 July 2014",2014-07-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2764396,R v Hammond [2014] NSWDC 175,"Sentence


1HIS HONOUR: Ian Hammond is 42 years of age. When he gave evidence before me yesterday I asked him how many birthdays he had spent out of gaol since he turned 20. He told me the answer was ""none"". Mr Hammond has a significant history of criminal misconduct, beginning in the Children's Court and including offences of armed robbery, the offence for which Mr Hammond must now be sentenced today. Indeed, at the time he committed the armed robbery for which I must sentence him he was on parole for an offence of armed robbery, having been released from custody a mere two days earlier. Mr Hammond demonstrates a continuing attitude of disobedience towards the law such that retribution and protection of society need to play an important part in the sentence I will impose upon him. 

2Mr Hammond, leading up to his release from parole, was hoping to go to Brewarrina. He had family there and had plans for the future, but upon his release he was told that that could not happen and he was placed in a halfway house. Very shortly afterwards he met up with someone, consumed drugs and committed the offence I am about to describe. 

3A Mr Brandon McDonald was walking home from work late on Monday 18 November 2013. The offender approached him and asked him for some money. Mr McDonald gave him some money but then the offender turned towards Mr McDonald and said, ""I have a knife here, give me your wallet."" Mr McDonald saw that the offender was holding a knife. He could see about 4 or 5 centimetres of the blade protruding from Mr Hammond's hand. Sensibly, Mr McDonald threw his wallet onto the ground and shouted, ""Get away from me."" Mr Hammond appeared not to have noticed because he repeated his demand but Mr McDonald emphasised that he had already thrown the wallet away and pointed it out on the road. At this, Mr Hammond picked up the wallet and walked away. 

4Mr McDonald then called police. When they arrived Mr McDonald got in the police car and they drove around the area. Eventually they found someone who looked like the man who had just robbed Mr McDonald. Police officers approached him. Mr Hammond, because it was he who was approached, began to walk away quickly, throwing something as he left. Eventually he was arrested. He said, ""It wasn't me, I haven't done anything."" When police searched the area where Mr Hammond was seen to throw something away they found some of Mr McDonald's property. When it was suggested to Mr Hammond that he had thrown this property away he said, ""You prove I threw them there."" Fortunately, CCTV footage demonstrated exactly that. 

5The circumstances that I have described demonstrate close affinity with the guideline offence of armed robbery postulated in the judgment of R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111;(1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 ACrimR 149, with two exceptions. One is that Mr Hammond's plea of guilty was entered at the earliest opportunity. The sentence proposed in Henry was for a plea of guilty of limited utility. And secondly, of course Mr Hammond is not a young man with a limited criminal history. Nevertheless, the Henry guideline is of importance in determining the appropriate sentence to impose in the present case. 

6Consistent with Mr Hammond's criminal history is his background. He comes from a large family, being the youngest of nine siblings. As he grew up he was placed in his grandmother's care in Dubbo, because of his mother's frequent intoxication from alcohol and misuse of prescription pills which rendered her incapable of caring for her children. A number of other extended family members lived with Mr Hammond's grandmother. Mr Hammond told the psychologist that he liked living there but the circumstances were far less than ideal primarily due to offending conduct committed by some of Mr Hammond's family members. 

7His uncles would engage in domestic violence when intoxicated with alcohol, which apparently occurred quite frequently. His grandmother would attempt to protect him from his uncles' violence by blockading herself and Mr Hammond in her bedroom, pushing a cupboard against the door to keep his uncles from entering. On occasions Mr Hammond would be sent by his grandmother out a window in order to contact the police. 

8This sort of upbringing could only really have had a lasting detrimental effect on Mr Hammond. As he grew up he learnt that violence was commonplace and he learnt that adults would stand over those with money in order to get money to buy alcohol. Later, he did live with his mother but she, because of her addiction to alcohol, was frequently intoxicated and passed out. 

9Although Mr Hammond enjoyed going to school and was a talented rugby league player, which gave him some positive notoriety, once his grandmother was placed in a nursing home his lifestyle became increasingly unstable. He went to school less and less and commenced what has become an almost lifelong misuse of drugs. He lost his place in the rugby league team, his grades and school attendance continued to decline and eventually he was asked to leave school.

10He has had some employment in the past but not much. He wants to work in the future. He has plans that involve returning once again to rural New South Wales where he sees that he will have more of a chance of turning his life around than he has had in the past. On occasions Mr Hammond has attempted to rehabilitate himself from his use of drugs, but, as is obviously the case, those attempts have not been successful. 

11One of the problems that Mr Hammond faced, and has faced in the past, concerns his E classification. At one stage Mr Hammond was convicted of escape, and Corrective Services authorities classified him accordingly. It is notorious that opportunities for things such as work release are denied those with such a classification. The result is that many prisoners like Mr Hammond are released on parole without ever having had the opportunity to ease their way back into society that is given to those prisoners who do not have such classification. 

12Some might be forgiven for thinking that the way E classification prisoners are administered represents a very shortsighted policy which does not do all that can be done to reduce the likelihood that prisoners such as Mr Hammond will re-offend upon release on parole. 

13Fortunately in Mr Hammond's case he has recently been reassessed. He is no longer in an E classification and so when he is released on parole in the future it is hoped that this will be after a period where Mr Hammond is given the opportunity to spend some time in the community. If so, when he is released from prison gates, the chances that he will be able to avoid reoffending in the future are maximised. 

14I mentioned that Mr Hammond was on parole at the time of this offence. That is, of course, a seriously aggravating feature but I also have to be careful not to double count by selecting a commencement date for this sentence which does not take account of the fact that he has been in custody and extending the sentence because of the aggravating feature that he committed this offence whilst on parole. I have decided to commence the sentence from the date of his arrest, 18 November 2013, notwithstanding the circumstance that he is currently serving the balance of parole of his sentence. 

15Mr Hammond's case is clearly one where the principles in R v Fernando (1992) 76 ACrimR 58, recently re-emphasised by the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571, are of direct application. His background and his upbringing was such that his decision as to whether he would abuse drugs, his decision as to how he would respond to various stresses in his life, his decision as to whether he would commit offences or not were made in the context of a background where such conduct was commonplace. Not all of us have the same opportunities in life, not all of us are equally able to make the decision to live a law abiding lifestyle. Mr Hammond's background is a significant mitigating feature and continues to be so, notwithstanding the passage of time. 

16One of the most important features of the sentence that I have to impose upon Mr Hammond concerns the issue of special circumstances. He has been in continuous custody since 31 October 2007, apart from the two days that he was on parole before he committed this offence. Effectively he is serving a long period of custody, and so in considering the ratio between nonparole period and a head sentence it would be quite wrong for me to treat the sentence I am about to impose in isolation. That circumstance is enough of itself to justify a significant variation from the statutory ratio in Mr Hammond's favour. I impose sentence as follows, 

17Mr Hammond is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 18 November 2013 and a head sentence of six years. Mr Hammond will thus be eligible to be released to parole on 17 May 2016.

		23 October 2014",2014-07-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2764420,R v Moylan [2014] NSWSC 944,"Judgment
1On 23 May 2014 the offender Jonathan Moylan pleaded guilty to the following offence:
On about 7 January 2013 at Maules Creek in the State of New South Wales he did disseminate information which was false in a material particular and the information was likely to induce persons in Australia to dispose of financial products, namely shares in Whitehaven Coal Limited, and when he disseminated the information he knew or ought reasonably to have known that it was false in a material particular.
The offence was contrary to s 1041E(1) Corporations Act 2001 (NSW).
2The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 10 years or a fine of $765,000 or both.
3The information that the offender disseminated was that on 7 January 2013 the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) announced that it had withdrawn its $1.2 billion loan facility to Whitehaven which was primarily intended to be used to develop its Maules Creek Project.
4The Offender disseminated the information by sending an email to 306 recipients at 104 different organisations including 295 recipients at 98 media organisations.  The email attached a document that falsely purported to be a media release from ANZ relating to Whitehaven.  
5The Offender knew the information was false in a material particular because he knew ANZ had not withdrawn the ANZ facility and had not made any such announcement.
Whitehaven and the Maules Creek project
6Whitehaven is an Australian coal mining company, which has been listed on the Australian Securities Exchange since 1 June 2007.  At the opening of trading on 7 January 2013 Whitehaven had 1,014,164,422 issued shares with a total market capitalisation of approximately A$3.56 billion.
7In December 2011, Whitehaven merged with Aston Resources Limited which owned 85% of the Maules Creek Project, a coal mining development located in the Gunnedah Basin of New South Wales.
8On 8 November 2012, Whitehaven issued a public announcement classified as price sensitive via the ASX company announcement platform and the Whitehaven website in which it announced that it had accepted an underwritten offer of a A$1.2 billion senior secured bank facility from ANZ.   The ANZ facility represented approximately 90% of Whitehaven's total debt financing.  $750 million of the $1.2 billion was allocated to develop the Maules Creek Project.  
9An anti-coal mining protest group that called itself Front Line Action on Coal (FLAC) was founded by the Offender and Murray Drechsler.  They established a camp on 5 August 2012 in the Leard State Forest in Boggabri near Maules Creek to protest against the Maules Creek Project.
10Between 5 August 2012 and 7 January 2013, the Offender and others in FLAC took certain actions including issuing a number of media releases as part of their opposition to the project.  During that period the Offender had accessed the ASX website page more than a dozen times as well as accessing an online forum discussing Whitehaven shares.  The offender also accessed media articles which referred to positive and negative news impacting on the share price of Whitehaven.   He was aware of, and discussed with others, the movement of the Whitehaven share price following a Whitehaven train derailment, and in relation to a failed takeover by Nathan Tinkler.
Specific planning concerning the offence
11On 4 January 2013, as a result of what he ascertained through a Google search, the Offender accessed the website of ""Crazy Domains"" and purchased for $27 the internet domain name ""anzcorporate.com"".  He also established the email address ""media@anzcorporate.com, providing his own name and personal contact details as part of the registration process.
12On 5 January he set up the email address referred to and subsequently tested it by sending test emails to his personal email addresses and to Mr Drechsler's email address.
13On the same day he accessed the Media Centre page of ANZ's website and viewed two genuine media releases issued by ANZ.  He also accessed articles via the internet relating to the finalisation of the ANZ facility.  
14Later on 5 January the Offender used his computer to create the false media release. 
15Between 7.03 pm and 7.28 pm on 5 January the Offender used his computer to create the false media release. He first inserted an ANZ logo, which he had previously downloaded from the internet, at the top of the false media release.  He formatted the release using the same lay-out, font and colour-scheme as the two genuine ANZ media releases he had viewed on the ANZ website.  
16He nominated the principal contact for media enquiries as ""Toby Kent, Group Head of Corporate Sustainability"".  Toby Kent was a person actually employed by ANZ with whom the Offender had previously had dealings through his activism against the Maules Creek Project.  He listed Mr Kent's email address as media@anzcorporate.com and his mobile telephone number as 0431 289 766, although both were actually the Offender's contact details.  He also set up a voicemail message on that mobile phone number in which he identified himself as ""Toby Kent from ANZ"". 
17Consistent with the two genuine ANZ media releases he had viewed, he nominated as a secondary contact for media enquiries the name of another person, Joanne McCulloch, who was actually a Media Relations Advisor at ANZ, with her correct title and contact details included.  
18The following day, 6 January, the Offender accessed legislation available on the Austlii legal information website and viewed the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), in particular s 250 (which contains the meaning of when a document is false) and s 253 (which creates the offence of forgery).19On the same day he sent the false media release from the email address media@anzcorporate.com to Mr Drechsler who, when he received it, said words to the effect ""it looks okay"".
20On the morning of 7 January the Offender researched Australian business media contacts via a number of internet sites.  
21At 10.46 am on 7 January the Offender accessed the transcript of an ABC interview with an international activist group known as the ""Yes Men"". The Offender had previously accessed videos of the Yes Men and their activities on 27 June 2012.  The Offender was aware that in 2004 a member of the Yes Men had falsely represented that he was a spokesperson for Dow Chemical Company and appeared on the BBC World television news program.  The Offender knew that in that case the media had initially accepted as genuine the spokesperson's announcement that a subsidiary company responsible for the Bhopal chemical disaster would be liquidated and the resulting $12 billion would be given as compensation to victims. That was later revealed to be a hoax.
22At 10.38 am on 7 January the Offender sent from his own email address a document to some 20 individuals associated with FLAC titled ""ANZ Week of Action"".  It was a 12 page document intended to be a guide for activists, with a number of suggested activities to ""shame"" ANZ, with the stated goal that ""If ANZ withdraws their loan, the Maules Creek Coal Mine will not proceed"".  There was also extensive advice on dealing with the media and police as part of any protest actions.  
23At 11.44 am on 7 January, the Offender disseminated the information in the false media release by sending an email from media@anzcorporate.com.  
24As noted, the media release contained the ANZ logo on the top right of the document and under the heading ""Media Release"" it said this:
For Release: 7 January 2013
ANZ divests from Maules Creek Project
ANZ today announced it has withdrawn its $1.2 billion loan facility to Whitehaven Coal, which was primarily intended to develop the Maules Creek Coal Project.
The decision is related to volatility in the global coal market, expected cost blow-outs and ANZ's Corporate Responsibility policy.
ANZ Group Head of Corporate Sustainabillty, Toby Kent, said: ""We want our customers to be assured that we will not be investing in coal projects that cause significant dislocation of farmers, unacceptable damage to the environment, or social conflict. The decision to withdraw our loan facility has been made after a careful analysis of reputational risks and analysis of the returns on this mine in the current climate of high volatility in the coal export market.""
Whitehaven Coal has been consulted in relation to the decision and the withdrawal of the loan facility became effective yesterday afternoon. The loan facility, which was drawn up on December 21, generated significant customer feedback and will no longer be enforceable.
ANZ is currently undertaking a review of coal and gas investments on productive agricultural lands and areas of high biodiversity.
25As mentioned earlier, in the media release under the words ""for media enquiries contact:"" appeared the name of Toby Kent, Group Head of Corporate Sustainability with the mobile telephone number 0431 289 766 and the email address mentioned, and the name of Joanne McCulloch as the Media Relations Advisor with apparently genuine telephone numbers and email address.  The telephone number given for Mr Kent was the Offender's phone number.
26The recipients of the email and false media release included Fairfax Media, News Limited, Australian Associated Press, various regional newspapers and radio stations as well as the five principal television channels.
27The email was not accompanied by any announcement from Whitehaven issued via the ASX company announcement platform.  Nevertheless, from about 11.55 am on 7 January a number of journalists and media organisations published or distributed stories in which the false media release was directly quoted or paraphrased and represented as a genuine media release issued by ANZ, including the following:
(a) At 11.55am the Newcastle Herald posted a brief report based on the false media release on its website. It remained there for ten minutes before being removed when it was ascertained it was a hoax;
(b) At 12.05 pm, AAP sent a ""Stock Watch report' to AAP finance news subscribers.  At 12.18pm AAP transmitted a story to its digital news subscribers conveying the content of the false media release.  After receiving reports from AAP, IRESS Ltd, a provider of technology and data services including related news sources to financial markets participants, forwarded them to its subscribers.  About ten minutes later AAP learnt that the false media release was a hoax and took steps to kill the story.
(c) At 12.20 pm, after unsuccessfully attempting to contact a public relations officer at Whitehaven for comment, the Australian Financial Review published a story on its website based on the false media release.  About five minutes later it was removed after ANZ advised that it was a hoax.
(d) At 12.24 pm, the original AFR story was forwarded through Bloomberg, a provider of technology and data services including related news sources to financial markets participants.  At 12.34pm Bloomberg reported on the drop in share price of Whitehaven Coal reporting that ""Whitehaven Plunges After AFR Report ANZ Bank Cancels A$1.2b Loan"".  Around 8 minutes later, Bloomberg learnt the false media release was a hoax and published a story to that effect.
Trading in Whitehaven shares
28From around 12.18 pm on 7 January the volume of trading in Whitehaven shares increased significantly until 12.41 pm when, at the request of Whitehaven who had learnt of the hoax, its shares were placed in a ""pre-open"" phase that prevented trading orders being executed.
29During the period between 12.18 pm and 12.41 pm:
(a) 141 individuals and entities traded 2,881,334 Whitehaven shares through 34 different stockbrokers.  This was more than 20 times the average volume of trades for Whitehaven shares during the same 23-minute period over the four trading days prior to, and four trading days after, 7 January;
(b) The price of Whitehaven shares fell from $3.515 (at 12.18 pm) to a low of $3.21 (at 12.38 pm), representing a fall of $0.305 or 8.7%, or a reduction in the market capitalisation of Whitehaven by around $300 million.
30The persons who traded included individual investors, brokers acting for clients such as self-managed super funds, managed funds and other wholesale investors.
31At 1.04 pm Whitehaven issued a genuine public announcement titled ""WHITEHAVEN COMMENT RE HOAX MEDIA RELEASE' in which it stated:
""Whitehaven Coal Limited has been made aware of a hoax media release suggesting that ANZ has withdrawn its recently announced $1.2 billion banking facility to Whitehaven.
There is no substance to the hoax media release. ANZ has confirmed the release is a hoax.""
32At 1.30 pm on that day trading in Whitehaven shares resumed.  The opening share price on the ASX was $3.53. At the close of trading that day the share price was $3.50.
33Between 1.30pm and the close of trading for the day, the number of Whitehaven shares traded was 5,664,137.  This was more than three times the average volume of trades for Whitehaven shares during that same period for the four trading days prior to, and four trading days after, 7 January.
34The total number of Whitehaven shares traded on 7 January was 9,665,440. This was more than three times the average number of Whitehaven shares traded per day over the four trading days prior to, and four trading days after, 7 January.
35Three groups of investors who traded in Whitehaven shares can be identified:
(a) Some investors sold shares based on the information in the false media release, but subsequently bought shares immediately after the trading halt, thereby mitigating or avoiding any losses (although not taking into account trading fees or tax consequences resulting from those trades);
(b) Some investors sold shares based on the information in the false media release, but were not then made aware of the nature of the hoax or were not otherwise in a position to mitigate their losses once the trading halt was lifted;
(c) Some investors sold shares when the price fell based on an automatic ""stop-loss"" function of their trading accounts, for example where their investment was funded through a margin facility or was in the form of a leveraged derivative product, and they were not in a position to mitigate their losses once the hoax was revealed.
The Offender's conduct after the issue of the media release
36From around 12.07 pm on 7 January a number of persons, including journalists, telephoned the person they thought was Toby Kent at the telephone number in the false media release.
37At about 12.17 pm Mr Ben Cubby from the Sydney Morning Herald telephoned ""Toby Kent"" to confirm the content of the press release.  The Offender answered the call and identified himself as ""Toby Kent"".  A conversation then ensued as follows:
Mr Cubby: When was Whitehaven told of the bank's decision?' 
The Offender: We informed Whitehaven yesterday at about 5pm. 
Mr Cubby: Why did the bank make this decision?
The Offender: Volatility in the global coal market, expected cost blow-outs and ANZ's Corporate Responsibility policy. 
Mr Cubby: This is a big story. I will call you back in half an hour to run through the details for a story.
38Immediately after speaking with the Offender Mr Cubby sent out a tweet on his Twitter account to around 8,000 followers to the effect: ""ANZ withdraws funding from Whitehaven Maules Creek Project"". At approximately 12.20 pm, after Mr Cubby learned that the false media release was a hoax, he sent out a further tweet to that effect and deleted the original tweet.  He then rang the Offender who again identified himself as ""Toby Kent"".  When Mr Cubby identified himself and challenged the offender saying that he thought it was a hoax, the Offender apologised, disclosed his true name and agreed to a recorded interview.
39During the course of the interview, when the Offender was asked why he did the hoax, he said:
Well we believe that ANZ customers have a right to know where their money is being invested.  ANZ Bank has loaned $1.2 billion to put a coal mine in that would be forcing farmers off their land and destroying the largest piece of native vegetation on north west NSW and ANZ customers have a right to know how their money is being used.
40He said that it was similar to the kind of stunt that was pulled by the Yes Men when they made the announcement about Union Carbide winding itself up to pay the victims of the Bhopal disaster.  The Offender said that they were putting out the message that ""our water, our health, our farmlands, these things are much more valuable than money"".  
41He was asked by Mr Cubby about whether he had any ethical qualms about lying to the public and he said:
Well, we took a bit of time to make this decision and it wasn't an easy one to make, at the end of the day we apologise to anybody who was affected but we are not going to apologise to Whitehaven Coal for destroying things that are invaluable and that belong to everybody. That impact, that destruction, is the big destruction here.
42At about 11:53 am Stephen Ries, the Senior Manager of Media Relations at ANZ, called the telephone number on the false media release for Toby Kent.  He heard the voicemail message identifying the speaker as ""Toby Kent from ANZ"".  Although he left no message a copy of his number was recorded on the Offender's phone. At around 12.19 pm the Offender called Mr Ries and identified himself by saying, ""This is Toby Kent from ANZ"".  Mr Ries replied, ""That is remarkable because Toby Kent is sitting right next to me"".  The Offender replied, ""No, this really is Toby Kent from ANZ"".  Mr Ries replied, ""No, you've called the media department at ANZ.  I know Toby Kent well.  He is English and speaks with an English accent.""  Mr Ries asked the Offender what group he was with, but the Offender terminated the call.43At around 12.20 pm, Chris Baker, an investment manager at Caledonia (Private) Investments, became aware from the AFR website about the ANZ withdrawing the facility.  Mr Baker instructed a broker to commence selling shares in Whitehaven held by one of Caledonia's investment funds. On further consideration, he became suspicious of the false media release, and at 12.50 pm he telephoned the number given for Toby Kent on the false media release.  His call was answered by a male who identified himself as ""Toby Kent"".  Mr Baker identified himself and said ""Is this a genuine release?""  The Offender replied, ""No it is not.  It's been established that this is a hoax. But the Maules Creek facility is under review by ANZ"".  Mr Baker believed he had been speaking to Toby Kent at ANZ. 
44At about 2.02 pm, after learning of the hoax, Mr Baker rang again the number on the false press release and asked the Offender, ""Is that Toby Kent?""  The Offender replied, ""Yes this is Toby Kent"".  When Mr Baker said that he believed the person was Jonathan Moylan, the Offender replied, ""Yes, I am Jonathan Moylan"".  When Mr Baker asked why he had done this, and told the Offender that he had sold shares and probably lost money by doing so, the Offender said, ""I did this to show to ANZ Bank customers and shareholders the damage the bank investment would have on the environment"".
45At around 12.58 pm the Offender used his computer to create a new media release on behalf of FLAC entitled ""ANZ Caught by Spoof"".  He sent this media release from media@anzcorporate.com to the same addressees as his earlier email which had attached the false media release.  This further release said as follows:
Monday January 7 2012 (sic)
A media release purporting to be from the ANZ bank announcing divestment from the Maules Creek Coal Project was in fact put out by opponents of the Maules Creek mine camped in the forest that would be destroyed if the mine went ahead.
ANZ has been under heavy pressure to withdraw from the project but still have maintained their $1.2 billion to Whitehaven Coal.
""ANZ customers have the right to know that their money is being invested in a project which will force farmers off their land and destroy 1,360ha of critically endangered koala habitat,"" said spokesperson Jonathan Moylan.
""We are determined to continue our campaign on ANZ bank until the bank shifts its investments to ethical investments.""
""Federal Environment Minister Tony Burke has still not decided whether to approve this project, and ANZ is putting their customer's money at risk by investing in this marginal and controversial project."" Mr. Moylan said.
For further comment:Jonathan Moylan 0431 289 766
46At 1.12 pm, Rob Harrison, an investment broker at BBY Limited Queensland, having sold Whitehaven shares on behalf of a self-managed super fund after becoming aware of the false media release, saw that it was now being reported by the media as a hoax.  Mr Harrison called the number nominated for Toby Kent on the false media release.  He asked for Toby Kent and the Offender said ""Yes that's me"".  Mr Harrison identified himself and asked what the situation was.  The Offender said:
Well, in fact, there was a second media release sent out.  I am actually not Toby Kent.  We're a group camped in Leard Forest where the Maules Creek mine is set to go.  But we sent out the media release because we believe that the ANZ 's customers have a right to know that their money is being invested in destroying farmland and forests.  We don't believe that ANZ customers would agree with this and ANZ needs to come clean about its dirty investments.  
47At one stage during the discussion the following exchange occurred:
Mr Harrison: Do you understand the impact of putting a false and fraudulent media release out to the public has on wealth and shareholdings in stock?  Did you consider that before you did this?
The Offender: Well we see this as similar to the Yes Men's announcement about Union Carbide compensating victims of the Dow Chemical spill in India.
Mr Harrison: So what you're actually saying is that you are prepared to destroy people's wealth and commit fraud by doing that, you're prepared to destroy people's wealth in order to make a message?  So what do you say for the people that have invested in Whitehaven Coal that you have destroyed their wealth? I, just to get a message, a fraudulent message across?
The Offender: Well, we would like ANZ to stop investing in destruction, I mean ...
Mr Harrison: Yep sure, okay I understand your ideology but at the same time you have destroyed the share price and people's wealth in the process.  You've cost, you've basically cost people money today by committing a fraudulent act.  Do you understand the repercussions that come off the back of this?
The Offender: What we understand is that today people are being forced off their land, our drinking water is being used up for unnecessary coal mines and all around the world people are dying today because of climate change and more lives will be affected if ANZ Bank does not come clean to its customers about what it is invested in.  I really do apologise for the concern and inconvenience that it's caused you.
48On 9 January, the Offender participated in an interview with Jamie Freed of AFR.  In that interview the Offender was asked if he was surprised that the false media release was published online.  He said:
Yes, I was.  I expected the Bank to make an announcement that they were either pulling out from the project or that they would say no, we are publicly stating we are investing in the most destructive coal mine in New South Wales.  I am sure we (scil they) wouldn't put it in those terms.
49He was asked if there were any threats of law suits and he said he had not had any claims yet but he would see what happened.  He was asked about small investors losing money and he said:
My main concern is what happens to the local community.  The consequences to me personally and financially is (sic) a lot less important.  
50On the same day, the Offender was interviewed by Conor Duffy, a journalist with the ABC.  The Offender was asked if he was surprised that the hoax worked so well.  He said:
Well my intention was to get ANZ to publicly admit to funding the Maules Creek coal project with all of its impact.  So, you know, the measure of success is whether the Maules Creek mine goes ahead.  I don't - I didn't really expect what happened, but will be happy when the community is safe and that, you know, the health and the water impacts aren't, you know, don't go ahead.
51He was asked if he had any qualms about lying to journalists and he made reference to the stunt pulled by the Yes Men.   The interviewer asked what his message was to the investors who had lost money through this, and the Offender said:
Well, our actions, my action was not targeting them, it was targeting ANZ and Whitehaven.  We want ANZ customers to know where their money is being invested and they do have a right to know that, and, you know, we're looking at our banks to make more responsible investment decisions so that we can actually start to see a shift in the way energy is produced and we are going to see an end to farmers being forced off the land and our forest being destroyed.
52The interviewer asked if the Offender thought it unfair for those investors who did lose money.  The Offender said:
Well, I do understand there were some day traders and speculators who lost money and it certainly wasn't the intent of the action.  I - my greatest concern, as I have said, is for the people who've been living in their home for generations and generations, for, you know, forest and water supplies that can never be replaced.
53The interviewer said:
You mentioned that they weren't the target.  Do you apologise to those people?
The Offender said: 
Well, I certainly didn't intend any harm to shareholders in Whitehaven and, you know, for the record, I do apologise.  Though I won't apologise for exposing ANZ's dirty investments in Whitehaven Coal and the process where the local community has been totally ignored and I have to say, you know, we've done everything.  We've written letters, we've written submissions, we've gone to planning assessment commission meetings, we've considered legal action but that avenue has been, actually, taken away from us because of the process that's been set up by the Coalition State Government.  ... We're up against, you know, a big company here and change doesn't happen without people taking risks and I think that, you know, this kind of thing is likely to happen in the future, perhaps not me, but people are going to be taking more and more risks to ensure that our rights and our environmental rights and the rights of landholders are respected and our children and grandchildren have a future.
The nature of the offence
54Section 1041E, by its broad terms, captures a wide range of prohibited conduct.  Persons ordinarily charged under this section have tended to disseminate false information for the purpose of receiving some gain for themselves or for some company with which they are involved.  However, the section extends beyond those types of cases.  
55At various times during the sentencing hearing reference was made to ""white collar crime"" with the Crown, in particular, drawing attention to analogous cases such as cases involving insider trading, tipping or making false statements for the purpose of personal gain.  Those types of cases have some elements in common including the loss of control over the false information, the involvement of and damage to the market, and the difficulties of detection, investigation and proof beyond reasonable doubt: Khoo v R [2013] NSWCCA 323 at [97]; Hartman v R [2011] NSWCCA 261 at [96] and R v Rivkin [2003] NSWSC 447 at [44].  
56Allsop P said in Joffe v R; Stromer v R [2012] NSWCCA 277; (2012) 82 NSWLR 510 at [34]:
Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act is concerned with financial services and markets. The objects of the Chapter are described in s 760A and include, as a central element, the promotion of public confidence in the fairness and honesty of markets for financial products. An important feature of that promotion of confidence is the presence of criminal offences for recognised market misconduct,... Confidence in the honesty and integrity of the financial markets is of the utmost importance in an economy and a society which depend significantly for their well-being on the efficient operation of such markets.
57A consequence of those matters, especially the difficulty in detection, is that general deterrence is of greater significance when sentencing for such offences.   I accept, here, that after the initial deception there was no attempt to conceal the crime.  Indeed, it was always going to be straightforward to ascertain who the perpetrator was.  The point of the offence was to be discovered after a short period of time.
58Parliament doubled the maximum penalty for offences against s 1041E and certain other market misconduct offences from 5 to 10 years imprisonment, with effect from 13 December 2010.  Senior Counsel for the Offender drew attention to what was said in the Explanatory Memorandum to suggest that the increased penalties were more relevant to offences like insider trading where personal gain was a significant matter.  He pointed to paragraph 3.5 of the Memorandum which said this:
The penalties for insider trading and market manipulation offences contained in the Bill reflect that the benefit which can be gained from engaging in this conduct often far outweighs the maximum penalty that can currently be imposed for a breach.
59Whilst it is true that the present offence did not involve personal financial gain, and that is relevant in the sentencing process, the Memorandum refers in a number of places to the need to increase penalties for ""market manipulation"" and ""market misconduct"", which was precisely what happened here.  No distinction is made for the type of offence under the section in relation to the maximum penalty.  The only point that could arguably be made is that sentences approaching the maximum should ordinarily be reserved for offences involving personal gain.                
 Sentencing principles60The offence committed is a Commonwealth offence.  The Offender is to be sentenced in accordance with Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  Some important matters are these:
(a)Any sentence imposed must be of a ""severity appropriate in all the circumstances to the offence"";
(b)The matters that must be taken into account are those matters listed in s 16A(2) although other matters may be considered;
(c)In determining the appropriate sentence, the Court must have regard to the nature and severity of the conditions that may be imposed on, or may apply to, the Offender, under the sentence;
(d)The Court must not pass a sentence of imprisonment unless, having considered all other available sentences, it is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.
61Not all of the matters in s 16A(2) are relevant for the present offending.  Having dealt above with the nature and circumstances of the offence, and losses to various groups, I will deal with the remaining matters that are relevant in what follows.
Objective criminality
62It is necessary that I come to a view about the objective seriousness of the offence.  It was said by Counsel at the sentencing hearing that this was an unusual case, perhaps a unique one, and I agree with those sentiments.  As noted earlier, ordinarily, persons guilty of an offence under s 1041E Corporations Act  have made false statements for the purpose of their own financial gain.  The present is not such a case.  The benefit that the Offender wished to achieve was both publicity for his cause, to oppose the mine project and, perhaps a hope that by that publicity, that decisions would be made by the ANZ and others that might help to achieve the Offender's aims of stopping the project.63As far as I can see he only intended harm to Whitehaven  and, in an indirect way, to ANZ which would possibly thus force its hand to withdraw support for the Company.  Although strict liability applies to paragraph (1)(b) of s 1041E which refers to the false statement being likely to induce persons to dispose of financial products, it is still a relevant inquiry in coming to a view about sentence whether the Offender knew that the false press release would damage the value of the shares of Whitehaven and result in financial harm to shareholders.  
64The Crown submitted that the Court should find that the Offender was at least generally aware of a risk that the dissemination of the information would  affect the share market.  However, the Crown also accepted that it was open to the Court to find that the Offender did not deliberately set out to affect the trading in Whitehaven shares.   
65The Offender is undoubtedly an intelligent person.  The offence was effected by reasonably careful and thorough planning so that at least in the short term the recipients of the false media release would believe the truth of what was contained within it.
66The Offender told Mr Peter Johnston, the Community Corrections Officer who prepared the pre-sentence report, that his motivation for his actions were wholly aimed at prompting a public admission from the ANZ Bank of their support of the Maules Creek Mine Project, therefore assisting in his overall goal of preventing the mining venture.  He claimed that he had no concept of the ramifications of his deception upon the stock market, Whitehaven Coal or investors, and claimed that he had no intent in that regard.
67I accept in the first place that the Offender's intention was to embarrass the ANZ Bank and to draw them out publicly on their support for the mining project. 
68The Crown pointed to an email sent by the Offender on 24 October 2012 to various individuals associated with FLAC where he said:
Since a failed takeover by Nathan Tinkler, Whitehaven's shares have plummeted to about $3 a share from a $7/share peak in April.  Their current profit margin is wafer thin.
69The Crown also pointed to the fact that the Offender had accessed the ASX website for Whitehaven some 14 times between 5 August 2012 and 2 January 2013, that at the FLAC camp he had discussed the movement of the share price following a Whitehaven train derailment, and that he had commented in an email about the effect on Whitehaven's share price in relation to the unsuccessful takeover by Nathan Tinkler. 
70It is clear, however, especially from the email sent at 10:38 am on 7 January 2013 attaching the 12 page document titled ""National Day of Action on ANZ: Action Organising Guide"", that the Offender was so focussed on the damage that he wished to do the ANZ by hurting its reputation, and encouraging its investors and shareholders either to put pressure on the Board or to withdraw their support for the Bank, that he did not think through how his actions would actually damage Whitehaven's investors, particularly small investors or beneficiaries of superannuation and retirement funds who might invest in that company.
71If he had thought the matter through a little more carefully, he would have realised that some investors would undoubtedly be injured by any reduction in Whitehaven's share price, whether because the Bank might withdraw its support or simply because of what the hoax might do to its share price in the short-term.  A reading of all of his remarks made shortly after the hoax was discovered suggest to me that he had not properly thought through the damage that might happen and that he was almost surprised when that was pointed out to him.
72I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he realised beforehand how investors would be hurt.  I am quite satisfied that it was not his intention to hurt them. 
73It also seems to me clear from the Offender's behaviour shortly after the false media release was distributed, that the Offender always intended to admit that it was a hoax within a relatively short period of time, but after it had had some impact and resulted, at least, in some statement from the ANZ.  
74It is perhaps unfortunate that the Offender chose not to give evidence at the sentencing proceedings so that his understanding and expectations of how various parties, including media outlets, might respond and react could be tested.  However, the evidence before me is sufficient to justify on the balance of probabilities the view I have reached that the Offender expected and intended that the hoax would have been discovered within a relatively short period of time, perhaps no longer than a few hours.  
75Nevertheless, the actual damage was considerable, as is made clear by the level of trading in Whitehaven's shares and the significant sudden drop in the share price.  I note that the share price recovered within a relatively short period of time, although that is not to ignore the damage done to individual investors who lost money by acting on the basis of the false statements. 
76As I have said, the offending was attended with a considerable degree of planning and pre-meditation, albeit over a fairly short timeframe of a few days.  The use of the logo, the examination of previous media releases by the ANZ, the purchase and use of the domain name, as well as the name of an actual employee of the Bank on the media release and in the recorded message on the phone, and the number of recipients of the email, especially the numerous media outlets, all attest to the level of the planning for the offence.
77One of the concomitants of this type of offending, the loss of control of price-sensitive information, was clearly present here.  The information contained in the false media release was published by the AFR on its website at 12.20 pm but removed five minutes later when ANZ advised it was a hoax.  In the meantime it was picked up by Bloomberg who did not become aware that it was a hoax until 12.42.   Mr Baker from Caledonia (Private) Investments, who saw the AFR story commenced selling Whitehaven shares.  He was not disabused of the position until, perhaps, 12.50 pm and probably later, because when he telephoned who he thought was Toby Kent, although he was told it was a hoax, he was also told by the Offender that the Maules Creek facility was under review by the ANZ.
78IRESS Ltd picked up the report from AAP and passed it on to its subscribers.  Mr Harrison from BBY Limited who sold Whitehaven shares on behalf of a self-managed superannuation fund on the basis of the false media release only became aware of the hoax at 1.12 pm.
79The Offender pointed to two matters that were said to minimise the seriousness of the offending.  The first was evidence from Mr Dreschler in an interview with ASIC where Mr Dreschler suggested that the Offender was rather surprised by the media's reaction to what he did.  The second matter was the issue of the lack of care that the journalists took to check the veracity of the material in the release.  Indeed, the Offender's Senior Counsel went so far as to say that the journalists more than the Offender ought to be held to account for the ultimate effect on the market.
80I completely reject that submission.  Whatever responsibility the journalists might have had to check the story, it is quite hypocritical of the Offender to point the finger at them when he set up the false media release intending (as he accepted) that at least some of them would accept it as genuine.    The whole point of the exercise was that the recipients of the media release should, at least for a period of time, accept the genuineness of what was given to them in order to embarrass and encourage the ANZ to say publicly that it was supporting the project or, what would be far less likely, to say that it would withdraw the funding.  
81If the Offender had really expected the journalists not to publish until an official statement from the ASX's announcement platform, the hoax would not have got off the ground.  If the Offender knew anything about the announcement platform and how it worked, he must have expected that at least some journalists would not wait for that sort of confirmation or the hoax would have had no effect.  
82I do not accept what Mr Dreschler said to ASIC that the Offender was surprised by the reaction of the media.  Nor do I accept what the Offender said in interviews, particularly to the Newcastle Herald, that he did not expect the reaction that he received.  
83In all of these circumstances I consider that the objective seriousness of the offence was about halfway between the low and medium ranges of offending.
Subjective matters 
84The Offender was born on 3 March 1988 and is 26 years old.  He completed his High School Certificate in 2006 and obtained a University Admissions Index score of 95.15.  In 2011 he graduated from the University of Newcastle with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in French and Linguistics.  He is fluent in three languages and has worked as a freelance translator since 2012.
85He is unmarried and not in a relationship.  Despite some family difficulties when he was child he has a positive perspective on his formative years.  He has good relationships with his parents.
86His founding of FLAC with Murray Drechsler has been referred to. Between 5 August 2012 and 7 January 2013 the Offender resided primarily at the FLAC blockade camp in the Leard State Forrest. 
87Since finishing his studies he has been involved in various employment activities such as working with Greenpeace and completing research for the Wilderness Society.  He informed Mr Johnston that the focus of these activities have been towards large companies involved in mining and government action that was allowing mining to occur.  He has involved himself in activities aimed at preventing mining and in conduct designed to bring these matters into the public arena.  
88It is in the course of these activities that he has been charged with a number of protest type offences as follows:
(a)On 29 June 2009 he was convicted at Raymond Terrace Local Court of resisting or hindering a police officer in the execution of their duty in respect of which he was fined $440, and for entering enclosed lands without a lawful excuse in respect of which he was fined $110.  On appeal the East Maitland District Court confirmed the convictions but quashed the $110 fine for the offence of entering enclosed lands without a lawful excuse.
(b)On 19 January 2010 he was convicted at Newcastle Local Court for the offence of going onto, into or remaining or in running lines in respect of which he was fined $750.
(c)On 26 October 2010 he was convicted at Newcastle Local Court of an offence of entering enclosed lands without lawful excuse in respect of which he was fined $300.
(d)On 31 January 2011 he was convicted at Muswellbrook Local Court of an offence of going onto, into, or remaining on or in running lines in respect of which he was fined $250.
(e)On 25 October 2011 he was convicted at Newcastle Local Court of the offence of entering enclosed lands without a lawful excuse.  No penalty was recorded.
(f)On 21 December 2011 he was convicted at Bega Local Court of an offence of entering enclosed lands without a lawful excuse and an offence of hiding tools, clothes or property to unlawfully influence a person.  In respect of the offence of entering enclosed lands he was fined $100.  For the offence of hiding tools he was fined $900 and placed on a bond to be of good behaviour for two years and six months pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  He was also ordered to pay compensation in the amount of $1204.  The good behaviour bond was stayed when he appealed to the District Court.  On 8 February 2013 the District Court confirmed the convictions but reduced the period of the s 9 bond to a period of nine months and reduced the amount of the fine to $300.  The result was that at the time of the commission of the present offence the Offender was not the subject of any bond or conditional liberty.
89The above represents fairly persistent offending over a relatively short period in furtherance of his beliefs and principles, albeit they are minor offences.  This offending needs to be considered when assessing the genuineness of the Offender's contrition for the present offence, and the likelihood of his re-offending.
90The Offender's referees speak highly of his integrity, and his passion and concern for social justice including for refugees and the indigenous community.
Contrition and plea of guilty
91The Offender was served with a Court Attendance notice on 27 June 2013.  He first appeared in the Local Court on 27 July 2013.   On 24 September 2013 he applied to waive his right to a committal and that was granted.  He was committed for trial in this Court on that day.  On 1 November 2013, at arraignment, the trial date was fixed for 30 June 2014.  As noted earlier, he pleaded guilty on 23 May 2014.  That was not at the earliest opportunity.
92However, the Offender's Senior Counsel submitted that the late plea should not be seen as a reflection on any lack of contrition.  He submitted that there was a serious legal question to be worked through concerning the issue of inducement in subsection (1)(b) of s 1041E although strict liability applies to that element of the offence.  I accept Senior Counsel's assurance that that was the reason for the delay.  Although it will impact on the discount for the plea, the late plea will not be taken as any lack of contrition.
93In Commonwealth matters a guilty plea is taken into account as a mitigating factor demonstrating a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.  In assessing the willingness of an offender to facilitate the course of justice the strength of the Crown case against the offender is a relevant consideration: Danial v R [2008] NSWCCA 15 at [27] - [28].   The Crown case against the Offender was a strong one.  However, having accepted that the assessment of a legal issue was the reason for the delay, it would not be fair to the Offender to say that he was not, before the plea, willing to facilitate the course of justice.  I consider that the appropriate discount is 15%.
94 The Offender tendered a letter to the Court dated 11 July 2014. The letter said this:
I am writing this letter by way of apology to people who traded in Whitehaven Coal shares as a result of the false press release that I sent out claiming that the ANZ Bank was withdrawing its support for the company. The fact that the release, which was intended to generate publicity about the ANZ loan, led to trading on the stock exchange came as a complete surprise to me. It was my failure to consider the market-sensitivity of the statements that led to trading that would not have otherwise occurred.
Wantonly causing harm or loss to others in no way forms part of my commitment to non-violence. Those who traded on that day have every right to feel deceived and angry about the consequences of my actions. Additionally, I am well aware that many people have their retirement savings managed by a broker and invested in Whitehaven, and such people may have lost money that they have worked hard to earn. Those people in particular deserve an apology and explanation for their unjust and undeserved loss.
It is for that reason that I made an apology on the 7:30 Report two days after the fact, and I also express my deep remorse in this written form.
95As has appeared from statements made and interviews given by the Offender shortly after the hoax was exposed, the Offender expressed some contrition for what he had done.  However, unlike what appears in the above letter, apparently written on the day of the sentencing hearing, many of the earlier expressions of remorse were somewhat qualified.  The statements made to Mr Harrison of BBY, Jamie Freed of AFR and Conor Duffy from the ABC seem to me to amount to qualified apologies to those who may have lost money.
96At the time of his interview with Mr Johnston in July 2014 he was fully cognisant of the adverse impact of his offending.  He said in hindsight that he regretted his actions in terms of the difficulties he had caused others.  He also said that he experienced some personal distress that the consequences of his actions conflicted with his principles of being non-violent and avoiding harm to others.  His letter to the Court expressed similar sentiments.
97I accept that the Offender is now contrite in respect of those who suffered as a result of his actions.  
Rehabilitation
98As far as the Offender's prospects of rehabilitation are concerned, I am inclined to accept the assessment of Mr Johnston, who assessed the Offender as a low risk of re-offending.  The possible re-offending is in relation to the commission of an offence such as the present.  It is clear that the Offender has been prepared to break the law on a number of occasions to further the causes in which he believes.  The number of offences for which he was convicted in a relatively short period of time attests to that.  
99By reason of the number of offences there is a need for specific deterrence.  I accept that the present offence is of a completely different type from the other offences.  However, it cannot be overlooked that this offence was the most successful from the Offender's point of view in drawing public attention to this particular cause that he advocates.
100I consider that there is a low likelihood the Offender will re-offend by committing an offence similar in nature and scale to the present.  He is not a criminal in the classic sense of one who needs rehabilitation, although I consider that there is some likelihood that he may continue to engage in what might be regarded as minor breaches of the law as acts of disobedience to further his beliefs and purposes.  The sentence needs to have regard to that matter.
Sentence
101I have read and noted a number of decisions concerning market misconduct offences.  In all cases sentences of imprisonment were imposed, although in some cases these were suspended in whole or in part.  Personal profit was the dominating motive in the cases.  The lack of such motive in the present case is what distinguishes it from those cases.
102Nevertheless, this was much more than some sort of public mischief offence where, for example a false report is made of a crime for some private purpose.  It was not the sort of case that prompted Lord Hoffman's remarks about protesters against the Iraq war in R v Jones [2007] 1 AC 136 to which my attention was drawn.  
103Here, the market was manipulated, vast amounts of shares were unnecessarily traded and some investors lost money or their investment in Whitehaven entirely.  These were not just ""day traders and speculators"" as the Offender said to Mr Duffy - superannuation funds and ordinary investors suffered damage.  It was intended that ANZ at least be embarrassed and that Whitehaven should be damaged or threatened, even if there was no intention to hurt shareholders and investors as such.
104I have considered all the available sentences and I am satisfied that no other sentence than imprisonment is appropriate in all the circumstances.  But for the guilty plea, I would have imposed a sentence of 2 years imprisonment.  With a 15% discount for the plea the appropriate sentence is a period of 1 year and 8 months (rounded down).
105However, taking into account the guilty plea, the fact that the hoax was readily admitted within a short period of time, the fact that the Offender has not previously been convicted of a serious offence, and the fact that the offence was not committed for the purpose of personal financial gain, nor was any obtained, I consider that the Offender should be immediately released upon giving security of $1000 upon the condition to be of good behaviour for 2 years with such sentence commencing today.
106Jonathan Moylan:  For the offence charged against s 1041E(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) I convict you and I sentence you to imprisonment for 1 year and 8 months.  I order that you be immediately released upon giving security by way of recognisance in the sum of $1000 to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years commencing today.
107I am obliged to explain to you the reasons for imposing a sentence of imprisonment.  The offence was a serious one.  Although you received no personal financial gain it was done in an attempt to achieve your own political purposes.  The market was manipulated, people were misled and lost money and investments as a result.
108I am also obliged to explain to you why I am ordering your immediate release on a recognisance.   I accept that you are now contrite for the damage that you have done.  I note your plea of guilty.  You did not commit this offence for personal gain nor did you receive any.  You did it for motives that I accept were sincerely held by you even though your methods of achieving them were wrong.  I do not consider that a sentence to be served in custody would serve any good purpose for you or the community.
109However, the sentence is one of imprisonment.  If you are not of good behaviour during the 2 year recognisance, which at a minimum means that you do not commit any further offences, or if you fail without reasonable excuse to fulfil or comply with the conditions of your recognisance, your recognisance may be forfeited and you will be brought back before the Court and the orders I have made may be revoked or cancelled.  You may be dealt with for the offence in respect of which the order was made and you may be required to serve a term of imprisonment in custody.  I also inform you that the recognisance release order may be discharged or varied on application made to the Court.

2764421,Keeley v R [2014] NSWCCA 139,"Judgment

1WARD JA: I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the judgments of Johnson J and RS Hulme AJ. I agree, for the reasons given by Johnson J, that leave to appeal against the sentence should be granted and that the appeal should be dismissed.

2The Applicant pleaded guilty to and has been convicted of three counts of aggravated sexual assault and one count of robbery. The factual circumstances in which the offences took place are detailed in Johnson J's judgment at [15]-[43]. They were, on any view of the matter, very serious offences. The Applicant's treatment of the victim was humiliating and degrading.

3The objective seriousness of an offence is to be determined by reference to the facts and circumstances of the particular case in question. In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282, Spigelman CJ stated (at [37]) that characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially within the role of the sentencing Judge in performing the fact finding exercise and drawing inferences from those facts. His Honour noted that the Court will be very slow to set aside a judgment made by a first-instance Judge exercising a broadly based discretion and considered that the question was whether or not the particular characterisation given by the sentencing Judge to the circumstances of the offence was open. Bathurst CJ referred to that statement of principle in R v KB; R v JL; R v RJB [2011] NSWCCA 190 at [51].

4In the present case, the sentences for Counts 1 and 2 reflect that the sentencing Judge considered that the offence the subject of the first penile/vaginal intercourse was objectively more serious than the offence involving digital penetration. There were factors, to which her Honour referred, that made each of those offences objectively very serious. I do not consider that her Honour erred when sentencing on the digital penetration count nor do I consider that the sentence for that count was manifestly excessive. I have nothing further to add to the reasons of Johnson J in that regard.

5The second point of disagreement between Johnson J and RS Hulme AJ is as to whether the sentencing Judge erred, when imposing sentence for the second offence of penile/vaginal intercourse (Count 3), by referring to the context of what had preceded it and in observing that the complainant might have thought her ordeal was over after the first offence of penile/vaginal intercourse.

6Her Honour's comments as to the latter were not, and did not in terms purport to be, a finding that the complainant had in fact thought her ordeal was over after the second s.61J offence. Nevertheless, an inference that the complainant might reasonably have thought that was the case was in my opinion open to her Honour. The Applicant had ejaculated at the conclusion of the first count of penile/vaginal intercourse. His penis had become flaccid. The demand then made of his victim, to which RS Hulme AJ has referred, while an indication on the Applicant's part of a wish to continue some form of sexual assault is not inconsistent with the reasonable conclusion that the worst of the victim's sexual ordeal was over.

7It was appropriate for her Honour to take into account the whole of the circumstances of the offending, including that the further sexual conduct occurred at a time when the victim had already been subjected to a violent and terrifying ordeal. Further penile/vaginal intercourse, albeit that it did not conclude in ejaculation, carried with it a renewed risk of infection and pregnancy; it was a repeated sexual attack and, as noted, it was of a humiliating and degrading kind. Her Honour did not in my opinion err in the exercise of her sentencing discretion.

8For those reasons, I agree with Johnson J.

9JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Daniel Paul Keeley, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed at the Newcastle District Court on 31 August 2012 with respect to serious sexual assault and robbery offences. 

10The Applicant pleaded guilty before her Honour Judge Wells SC to the following offences:

(a) three counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (involving the infliction of actual bodily harm) contrary to s.61J Crimes Act 1900, each punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years;

(b) one offence of aggravated robbery involving the deprivation of personal liberty contrary to s.95(1) Crimes Act 1900, punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment.

11By way of a Form 1, the Applicant requested the sentencing court to take into account, on sentence for one of the s.61J offences, an offence of indecent assault contrary to s.61L Crimes Act 1900 which, if prosecuted separately, would have been punishable by a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.

12The sentencing Judge imposed the following terms of imprisonment:

(a) for the offence of aggravated robbery, a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to commence on 11 August 2011 and expire on 10 February 2013;

(b) for the first offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (digital penetration), imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of seven years and six months commencing on 11 August 2012 and expiring on 10 February 2020, with a balance of term of two years and six months commencing on 11 February 2020 and expiring on 10 August 2022; 

(c) for the second offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (penile penetration), taking into account the matter on the Form 1, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of nine years commencing on 11 August 2012 and expiring on 10 August 2021, with a balance of term of three years commencing on 11 August 2021 and expiring on 10 August 2024;

(d) for the third offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (penile penetration), imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of nine years commencing on 11 August 2014 and expiring on 10 August 2023, with a balance of term of three years commencing on 11 August 2023 and expiring on 10 August 2026.

13The overall effective sentence involved a head sentence of 15 years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 12 years expiring on 11 August 2023 and a balance of term of three years expiring on 10 August 2026. 

Grounds of Appeal

14The Applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a) Ground 1 - The sentencing Judge erred in making factual findings lacking an adequate evidentiary foundation.

(b) Ground 2 - The sentencing Judge erred in imposing sentences that doubly punished the circumstances of the last offence.

(c) Ground 3 - The sentences are unreasonable and/or plainly unjust.
 

Facts of the Offences

15What follows is drawn from an Agreed Statement of Facts tendered in the District Court.

16In July 2011, the victim, a 23-year old woman, was working at a shopping centre in Newcastle West. She lived at The Hill and usually drove to and from work.

17On 11 July 2011, the victim was due to leave for work at 2.45 pm and went to her car. She discovered that she had a flat tyre and arranged for a friend to drop her at work. She informed her friend that she would make her own way home. Her working hours that day were from 3.00 pm to 8.00 pm.

18Upon completing work at about 8.00 pm, the victim obtained some advice from work colleagues as to the safest way to walk home. She followed the advice and commenced her journey home on foot.

19Photographs obtained from closed-circuit television footage were tendered at the sentencing hearing. They depict the victim walking in the street. The sentencing Judge observed that the photographs demonstrated that she was a young lady of slight build.

The Victim is Accosted by the Applicant in the Street

20As the victim walked along Parry Street, Cooks Hill, approaching Dawson Street, she observed the Applicant (then aged 29 years) walk diagonally across the road at that intersection. She thought that he had walked down Dawson Street towards King Street.

21As she crossed Dawson Street, the victim noticed movement out of the corner of her eye. She saw the Applicant jogging towards her. The Applicant said, ""Hey wait, wait, wait"". The victim responded, ""What are you doing?"". The Applicant then grabbed the victim's wallet from her hand. She thought that he was going to run off with her wallet. The victim said to the Applicant, ""Just take it"".

22At this point, the victim had an opportunity to observe her assailant in some detail. She noted that he was wearing a black beanie and a black-coloured ski jacket, with a zip at the front, made of canvas or other hard material. The jacket was done up to his chin. The Applicant was wearing tracksuit pants. The Applicant had a beard and was about 5'9"" tall and of medium build.

23The Applicant initially took two or three steps away from the victim, but then came back to her and said, ""Come on, come on, come with me"". At the time he was behind the victim, pushing her with his left hand and had his right arm over her chest. The victim said, ""What are you doing?"". The victim tried to call ""000"", but the Applicant noticed she had a phone and said, ""Give me the phone"". The victim threw the phone away so the Applicant could not get it.

The Applicant Forces the Victim into an Alley at Knifepoint

24The Applicant said, ""Be quiet, come this way"" and was pushing the victim. He said, ""Look, do you want me to cut you?"". The victim then realised that the Applicant was holding a knife to her neck. At this point, they were in the middle of the intersection. She complied with the Applicant's request to move and he said, ""Slow down, I can't run that fast"". 

25The Applicant forced the victim towards an alley that ran between houses and a bowling club. She was continually saying to the Applicant, ""Stop it, what are you doing? No, no, no"". The victim was trying to rationalise with the Applicant, but he kept telling her to be quiet. She said to him, ""Take my money, I'll give you my money. I'll give you my keycard, we can go to the bank and get you money"". The Applicant responded, ""I'll cut you. Come with me"".

26Once in the alleyway, the Applicant continued to tell the victim to be quiet. She said, ""Don't, I have my period"". The Applicant said, ""Get on the ground"". He forced the victim onto the ground and onto her back. In the process, the victim suffered a graze to her knee.

27The victim saw a knife in the Applicant's right hand. She grabbed hold of his right hand and said ""No"". She could smell alcohol on him. The Applicant was touching the victim near her vagina, on the outside of her clothes. She called for help. The Applicant said, ""Shut up. Do you want me to stab you? I'll stab you. Don't say help again. I'll stab you"". The victim responded, ""Ok"". 

28The victim had hold of the Applicant's hand containing the knife and he was moving his hand around in an effort to break her grip. He said, ""Let go of my wrist or I'll stab you"". He then held the knife above her head and forced the knife down hard. As she was in the process of protecting herself, the Applicant cut the victim's left hand and she let go of his hand. 

29At this point, the Applicant's mobile phone rang, which was ignored. 

30The Applicant then put his right hand and the knife between the victim's legs and cut her skirt, underpants and stockings and removed them. She said again, ""I have my period"" but the Applicant responded, ""You are lying"". 

Aggravated Sexual Intercourse Without Consent - Digital Intercourse (Offence 1)

31The Applicant then inserted his fingers into the victim's vagina. He had moved the knife from his right hand to his left hand and held it near her head. The victim then asked if she could remove her tampon and she did so.

32The Applicant was lying on top of the victim and was pressing down hard upon her. The Applicant removed his own pants. The victim put her hands down near his waist in an unsuccessful effort to push him off, and in doing so she touched the Applicant's penis which she noticed was small and soft. The Applicant said, ""Kiss it"". To avoid having to perform fellatio, she masturbated the Applicant.

33The victim tried to calm the Applicant down, being in fear that she was going to be stabbed. 

Aggravated Sexual Intercourse Without Consent - Penile/Vaginal Intercourse (Offence 2)

34The Applicant's penis became hard. He tried to put his penis into her vagina. The victim, in an effort to hasten the end of the ordeal, assisted the Applicant to insert his penis into her vagina. He then had sexual intercourse with her. The Applicant kissed her on the face. He told her, ""Kiss me, open your mouth"". She complied, noting that he tasted of sweet alcohol. The Applicant ejaculated and his penis went soft. 

35The Applicant said to the victim, ""Try to make me hard. I want to see your tits"". The victim exposed her left breast. She again masturbated the Applicant. The Applicant inserted fingers into her vagina whilst saying disgusting things to her (there was no separate charge relating to this event). 

Indecent Assault (Form 1)

36The Applicant told her, ""You have the nicest little tits and you are so tight"". The Applicant started kissing her on the left breast. This constituted the indecent assault offence on the Form 1. 

Aggravated Sexual Intercourse Without Consent - Penile/Vaginal Intercourse (Offence 3) and Aggravated Robbery (Offence 4)

37The Applicant then put his penis into her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. His mobile rang again. The Applicant stopped. He stood up and pulled up his pants. He said something like, ""Thank you Miss"". He picked up her wallet and ran.

38The victim composed herself. She used her cardigan to cover the lower half of her body and walked down the lane towards Dawson Street, being the opposite direction to that which the Applicant had fled. When she reached Dawson Street, she saw the Applicant and ducked behind a car to hide from him.

The Victim Complains and Assistance is Provided

39The victim knocked on a nearby door and told the occupant, ""I've been raped. Will you help me please"". Police and an ambulance were called.

40Police attended and the victim was taken to the John Hunter Hospital. She had sustained a laceration to a finger on her left hand, a graze to her left knee, bruising and abrasions to her back and general soreness. As a result of forensic examination and analysis, a semen sample was obtained which contained DNA consistent with the Applicant.

The Applicant Takes Steps to Avoid Detection

41On 16 July 2011, the Applicant attended the RTA to obtain a fresh licence in the name of Daniel Paul Keeley. Up until that time, his licence had been in the name of Daniel Paul Marriott. This involved changing his surname to his mother's maiden name. The Applicant had shaved off his full facial beard.

The Applicant is Arrested and Charged

42Thereafter, the Applicant travelled to Bali for a holiday. On 11 August 2011, the Applicant was arrested at the Sydney International Airport on his return from Bali. The Applicant maintained his innocence to police and declined to be interviewed. He was charged with the present offences. 

43The Applicant remained in custody after his arrest on 11 August 2011. 

Impact of the Offences Upon the Victim

44An affidavit of the victim dated 21 November 2011 was tendered at the sentencing hearing. The sentencing Judge recorded the contents of that affidavit and made findings which were not challenged in this Court (ROS4):

""In an affidavit dated 21 November 2011 she indicated that the attack upon her has left her severely depressed and suicidal. She says [she] has not told her closest friends or family the details. She describes it as the most personal and traumatic thing that has ever happened to her. There can be no doubt that circumstances such as these would be likely to cause her to suffer lasting depression and affect her emotionally for the rest of her life.""

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

45The Applicant was born in August 1981. He was 29 years old at the time of the offences and 31 years of age at the time of sentence. 

46The Applicant has a record of prior convictions for property, driving, firearm and drug offences. He has no prior convictions for sexual offences.

47There are a number of entries for break, enter and steal, larceny and PCA offences between 1993 and 2005. In the Children's Court, he had been sentenced to community-based orders and control orders. In the Local Court, he had been sentenced to community-based orders and, in 2005, he received a six-month suspended sentence for an offence of driving with high-range PCA. He has not previously been sentenced to full-time imprisonment.

48On 20 September 2012, some three weeks after the imposition of the present sentences, the Applicant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment in the Newcastle Local Court for 13 offences of larceny and three offences of malicious damage to property. These sentences (as they must) ran entirely concurrently with the present sentences. As the Applicant had been in custody since his arrest for the present offences on 11 August 2011, and had been on holiday in Bali for part of the month between the sexual assault offences and his arrest, it is likely that these further offences were committed prior to, or soon after, the sexual assault offences. I will return to this aspect later in the judgment.

49A report dated 19 June 2012 of Dr Christopher Bench, psychiatrist, was tendered at the sentencing hearing, together with a report of Ms Debbie Case, psychologist, dated 31 January 2012. The Applicant did not give evidence and no other oral evidence was given at the sentencing hearing. 

50The reports revealed that the Applicant was the only child of his parents. His mother was Aboriginal and his father was Caucasian. The Applicant's parents separated when he was two years of age and he resided thereafter with his mother. When he was five years of age, his mother remarried and had three more children. The Applicant has had no contact with his father since he was 10 years of age.

51The Applicant was unemployed at the time of these offences and in receipt of unemployment benefits. He had been employed in the past in various positions, including in a wrecking yard, a cleaning business, a factory and labouring positions.

52The Applicant informed the psychiatrist and psychologist that he had been sexually assaulted by a soccer coach when he was 10 years of age. He stated that he attended counselling for about three months. He completed Year 8 at school, but was expelled. He left home in his late teens. He attempted Year 10 at TAFE, but did not attend regularly because of substance-abuse issues.

53Static risk assessment undertaken by Ms Case placed the Applicant in the medium-to-high range in terms of risk of reoffending in relation to sexual matters. Personality testing by Ms Case indicated the presence of severe pathological personality traits, namely borderline personality traits which may lead him to suffer from intense instability of mood and behaviour. High scores on drug dependence and alcohol dependence confirmed a number of associated traits, including hedonism and impulsiveness. Ms Case observed that such offenders are widely accepted as challenging to treat and most respond slowly.

54Dr Bench noted that the Applicant would meet the diagnostic criteria for polysubstance dependence and for Cluster B Personality Disorder with borderline and antisocial traits. According to Dr Bench, the Applicant has had an almost lifelong pattern of mood instability, unstable interpersonal relationships, impulsive behaviour in the form of drug use, gambling and violence, recurrent suicidal behaviour and difficulty controlling his anger. Dr Bench considered that the Applicant has personality traits of both Anti-Social and Borderline Personality Disorder, prompting the diagnosis of Cluster B Personality Disorder. 

55With respect to the risk of recidivism, Dr Bench noted as concerning features the Applicant's drug and alcohol abuse, his relationship instability and domestic violence in his relationship at the time of the present offences, with a further factor affecting his risk of reoffending being his ""significant personality pathology"".

56Dr Bench found that there was no evidence to suggest that the Applicant was suffering from a significant mood, anxiety or psychotic disorder at the time of the present offences.

57Dr Bench considered that the Applicant needed to abstain from all drugs and alcohol for life or he would be a significant risk of reoffending.

58The sentencing Judge observed that there was nothing in the Applicant's circumstances that indicated features that would attract application of the principles in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 (ROS5). It was not submitted in this Court that this approach was wrong or that the principles in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 apply to this case.

59The Applicant had expressed remorse for the present offences in his conversations with Dr Bench and Ms Case. The sentencing Judge noted, however, that the Applicant had entered pleas of guilty only after the DNA evidence became available. The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. Her Honour observed that, in these circumstances, limited weight should be given to the Applicant's expressions of remorse.

60Her Honour allowed a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the Applicant's pleas of guilty.

Ground 1 - Claim of Error in Making Factual Findings Lacking an Adequate Evidentiary Foundation

61This ground of appeal is directed to findings made by the sentencing Judge concerning the Applicant's level of premeditation and the rejection of a submission that the offences were opportunistic. 

62The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. However, submissions were made by reference to his accounts to the authors of the psychiatric and psychological reports. The Applicant had said to them that he had been fishing that day, that the offence had occurred on the spur of the moment and that he was significantly intoxicated.
 
63Her Honour referred to these matters (ROS9-10):

""In relation to the offences, he said to both the psychologist and the psychiatrist that he had been fishing all day and that he had consumed around twenty-two beers. He said he had smoked marijuana early that morning before he left. He reported confusion about his motivation in committing the offences. He said the details were unclear and it was like a dream. He said to the psychologist that he was able to remember the sexual acts but could not remember taking the victim into the alley or threatening her in any way. 

That account is not consistent with the duration of the behaviour to which he has pleaded, nor with the account given by the complainant, which omits any mention at all of him appearing to be intoxicated by way of slurred speech, stumbling, falling around. To the contrary, what she noticed was the taste or smell of alcohol only when she had to kiss him.

He said that his loss of memory with regard to the details might have been in part due to intoxication, though he did admit to the psychologist that it was likely that he was reluctant to admit to himself what he had done. He denied to the psychologist that the offence was premeditated and said that the knife was in his bag from his day out fishing.

He told Dr Bench that it was all kind of a blur, that he did not remember much and that he did not remember exactly what happened. He said he remembered standing at the corner and bumping into the complainant. He remembered taking her into the alleyway and doing what he did but he could not recall all of the details, only some. He said he remembered thinking about the way he wanted to go home before the offences and that he wanted to avoid Darby Street with all of his fishing gear.

The complainant, as I have noted, gave a detailed description of his appearance and clothing. She did not note that he had any bag or fishing tackle. Given the extent of detail she provided, had he had a bag or fishing tackle it seems to me that she would have noticed that.""

64Other findings under challenge were contained in the following extract from the remarks on sentence (ROS10-11):

""Consequently, the story that he has given about fishing all day is either an invention or he had his gear hidden away somewhere in order to allow the offences to be committed. On either scenario, it must be inferred that there was a significant level of premeditation. He has not given any sworn evidence to the effect that it was not premeditated and consequently I give little weight to that claim.

At the commencement of the offence, he asked the complainant for her purse. Though never submitted, it might be postulated that the events started out as a robbery and at some point he changed his mind and it turned into more, namely the aggravated sexual assaults. On the other hand, he seemed to immediately know that the laneway or alleyway was available. He took her, on her account, quite directly into that area in order to commit the offences. 

For those reasons, I reject his claim that this was an opportunistic set of offences. It was either not the case that he had been fishing all day as he claims or he had planned this attack at least by the time that he needed to secrete his bag or fishing gear.

Taking into account the manner in which he was able to carry out the offences, I conclude that he is exaggerating the amount of alcohol that he says he consumed that day and that he is doing that to mitigate the seriousness of what he has done. I find that he is less than frank when he says that he has little memory of the details of these offences. He was able to maintain control of the complainant for an extended period of time. He was able to march her down a dark alleyway at knifepoint. He was able to change the knife from one hand to another whilst removing her clothing and removing his own.

Accordingly, I do not accept that he was as intoxicated as he would want this court to believe. I would accept that he was intoxicated to a small extent but not such as he claimed.

I find that there was some level of premeditation or planning and that this was not an entirely opportunistic offence.""

65A further finding of the sentencing Judge should be noted (ROS16-17):

""Nor is it found that his judgment was affected by the effects of voluntary excessive consumption of alcohol or drugs. As indicated already, this offence did not have the hallmarks of someone who was excessively or even moderately under the influence of alcohol or drugs such that there was impact on his judgment. He carried out the offences in an efficient and forceful manner.""

Submissions of the Parties

66Mr Gartelmann, counsel for the Applicant, noted the rejection by the sentencing Judge of the Applicant's account of the amount of alcohol he had consumed as it was ""not consistent with the duration of the behaviour"" involved in the offences, and the absence of ""any mention at all of him appearing to be intoxicated by way of slurred speech, stumbling, falling around"" in the victim's account. Counsel pointed to the Judge's finding that the offences did not have the ""hallmarks"" of someone excessively or even moderately under the influence of alcohol, as they were carried out in an ""efficient and forceful manner"" (ROS17).

67Mr Gartelmann submitted that there was no adequate evidentiary foundation for the finding that the offences were premeditated or planned. It was submitted that the absence of mention in the Agreed Facts of the victim noticing the Applicant with fishing gear did not establish that the Applicant either did not have fishing gear or had secreted it. The fact that the Applicant took the victim directly to the lane did not establish that he had prior knowledge of the lane, or planned to commit the offences there. 

68Although counsel accepted that it was open to the sentencing Judge not to accept the Applicant's explanation for possession of the knife, it was submitted that the conclusion that he planned to commit the offences was unwarranted. It was submitted that, as the sentencing Judge had recognised, it was possible that the Applicant initially intended to take the victim's wallet, then changed his mind, and yet the facts did not disclose the knife was used in the robbery. 

69It was submitted further that there was no adequate evidentiary foundation for the finding that the Applicant exaggerated the amount of his alcohol consumption and the level of his intoxication. According to this submission, the sentencing Judge was incorrect in stating that the victim only noticed the taste or smell of alcohol when she had to kiss the Applicant, as the Agreed Facts stated that the victim smelt alcohol on the Applicant at an earlier stage. It was submitted further that the manner in which the offences were committed did not provide an adequate evidentiary foundation for the Judge's conclusion regarding the Applicant's level of intoxication.

70Counsel submitted that, although it was open to the sentencing Judge not to be satisfied of the Applicant's accounts to the psychiatrist and psychologist regarding his alcohol consumption and level of intoxication, the conclusion that he exaggerated it in order to mitigate the seriousness of the offences was unjustified.

71In support of the submission, Mr Gartelmann referred to The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28] and Duffy v R [2009] NSWCCA 304 at [21].

72Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the findings that the offences were premeditated or planned, and that the Applicant exaggerated the amount of his alcohol consumption and the extent of his intoxication in order to mitigate the seriousness of the offence, were findings adverse to the Applicant and were required to be established beyond reasonable doubt. It was contended that neither the evidence in the proceedings, nor inferences reasonably to be drawn from the evidence, justified these findings. 

73Counsel also submitted that the findings were material to the exercise of the sentencing discretion as they deprived the Applicant of leniency that might otherwise have been warranted.

74The Crown noted that the sentencing Judge's ultimate finding concerning planning was that ""there was some level of premeditation or planning and that this is not an entirely opportunistic offence"" (ROS11). It was submitted that this finding was open to the sentencing Judge and that it involved a limited finding adverse to the Applicant, with an acceptance of a limited level of premeditation or planning.

75With respect to the finding concerning intoxication, the Crown submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge, by reference to the documentary evidence, to conclude that the Applicant had exaggerated the amount of alcohol he had consumed prior to the commission of the offences. In any event, the Crown submitted that there was nothing in the remarks on sentence to indicate that the finding concerning intoxication operated in a manner to occasion a harsher sentence than might otherwise had been imposed. 

Decision

76This ground of appeal seeks to challenge a factual finding made by the sentencing Judge. The approach of this Court in determining such a ground was summarised in R v Hinchliffe [2013] NSWCCA 327 at [196] in the following way:

""To overturn a factual finding by a sentencing Judge, it is necessary for this Court to be satisfied that there was an error of principle, or a mistake of fact or law, such that the sentencing discretion of the trial Judge miscarried. In its review, the Court is bound by findings of fact by the sentencing Judge unless they were not open on the evidence or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557 at 573 [61].""

77It should be kept in mind that the Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. The evidence before the Court to be considered for the purpose of these factual issues comprised the Agreed Statement of Facts and the psychiatric and psychological reports tendered at the sentencing hearing.

78In these circumstances, it was correct for the sentencing Judge to give very limited weight to the statements made by the Applicant to the psychiatrist and psychologist reproduced in their reports: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 369 at 377 [58]-[59], 380 [79]; R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174 at 184-185 [39]-[41].

79The finding actually made by the sentencing Judge with respect to premeditation was, in reality, the most favourable finding which the Applicant could have expected in light of the evidence adduced on sentence. The sentencing Judge did not characterise the offence as fully or substantially premeditated, nor was the claim of opportunism completely rejected. The sentencing Judge's finding was that there ""was some level of premeditation or planning and that this was not an entirely opportunistic offence"". 

80This finding was open on the evidence and did not operate to the disadvantage of the Applicant. Indeed, as has been mentioned, he could not reasonably expect any better finding on this aspect in light of the evidence before the sentencing Judge. 

81The Applicant has not established error with respect to this finding.

82In making a finding concerning intoxication, the sentencing Judge was entitled to have regard to the narrative of the offences contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts, based as it was upon the close attention paid by the victim to the Applicant's words, acts and demeanour throughout the whole frightening episode. 

83The accounts provided by the Applicant to the psychiatrist and psychologist concerning his intake of alcohol and his fishing activities were, of course, unsworn and untested. There was, in fact, some inconsistency between the accounts set out in the two reports.

84I do not accept the submission for the Applicant that the onus lay upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt any proposition in this case. It was the Applicant who raised the question of intoxication in the accounts he provided to his psychiatrist and psychologist. A submission was made on his behalf that intoxication was to be taken into account in his favour on sentence. The sentencing Judge did not accept the submission made concerning intoxication, noting as well that there had been a measure of exaggeration on the Applicant's behalf according to the evidence. 

85The Applicant was sentenced before the commencement of s.21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on 31 January 2014. That section now excludes by statute self-induced intoxication being taken into account as a mitigating factor on sentence. However, the law at the time when the Applicant was sentenced was to a similar effect. Although an offender's intoxication, whether by alcohol or drugs, could explain an offence, it ordinarily did not mitigate the penalty: Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; 199 A Crim R 38 at 44 [26]. Courts around Australia have consistently rejected the proposition that intoxication can mitigate the seriousness of an offence or reduce an offender's culpability. Although an ""out of character"" exception has been acknowledged to exist, it has almost never been applied: R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [82]; ZZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 83 at [110].

86The unsworn, untested and somewhat inconsistent accounts given by the Applicant to the psychiatrist and psychologist did not sit comfortably with the detailed account given by the victim in the Agreed Statement of Facts.

87It is sufficient to determine this ground of appeal to express the view that the Applicant has failed to demonstrate error on the part of the sentencing Judge in the findings challenged by the first ground of appeal.

88I would reject Ground 1.

Ground 2 - Claim of Error in Imposing Sentences that Doubly Punished the Circumstances of the Last Offence

Submissions of the Parties

89This ground was directed towards the acceptance by the sentencing Judge of a Crown submission that the Applicant's sexual offences were ""above mid range but not in the worst category"", but that ""getting close to the worst case category"" was ""the second offence involving penile vaginal intercourse in the context of what had preceded it"" (ROS16), a reference to Offence 3.

90Mr Gartelmann submitted that the sentence imposed for that offence was the same as the sentence imposed for the first offence involving penile/vaginal intercourse (Offence 2). The sentence on Offence 2 reflected the additional criminality involved in the Form 1 offence. 

91Accordingly, Mr Gartelmann submitted that it appeared that the sentence imposed for Offence 3 reflected the sentencing Judge's conclusion that the offence was of greater seriousness because it was committed in the context of the preceding offences. The sentencing Judge stated that it was proposed to partially accumulate some of the sentences as they were ""separate and distinct offences although carried out within one course of conduct"" and, in particular, the second act of penile/vaginal intercourse ""in the context of the circumstances will attract significant accumulation"" (ROS18).

92Counsel submitted that, in taking this approach, the sentencing Judge had failed to apply correctly the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. It was submitted that her Honour failed to apply proper principles in determining either the sentence for Offence 3, or the extent of its accumulation, with the effect of doubly punishing the one circumstance of the Applicant's conduct: Pearce v The Queen at 624 [49].

93The Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated as contended for in this ground of appeal. It was submitted that the sentencing Judge had approached issues of accumulation, concurrency and totality in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen. It was emphasised that Offence 3 occurred at a time when the victim may have thought that the ordeal was over, only to experience a further offence involving penile/vaginal intercourse. 
 
Decision

94It is appropriate to set out the parts of her Honour's remarks on sentence which give rise to this ground of appeal. 

95Her Honour said (ROS16):

""It was submitted on his behalf that these sexual assault matters are mid range offences. The Crown has contended that they are above mid range but not in the worst category.

I accept the submission of the Crown. However, I note that getting close to the worst case category is the second penile vaginal intercourse offence in the context of what had preceded it. Furthermore, there is largely an absence of factors that mitigate the objective seriousness. There are injuries inflicted on other complainants that are worse. It was an isolated incident, although it involved multiple offences.""

96With respect to accumulation, the sentencing Judge said (ROS18):

""In passing sentence I propose to partially accumulate some of the sentences imposed for these offences, given that they are separate and distinct offences although carried out within one course of conduct. In particular, the second act of penile/vaginal intercourse, that is the further offence, in the context of the circumstances will attract significant accumulation.""

97The sentencing Judge approached the task of sentencing the Applicant for several crimes arising from the one course of conduct in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen. It was open to the sentencing Judge to conclude that the final offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent was of greater objective gravity, occurring as it did at a time when the victim had been subjected to several offences, only to be once again made the subject of forced penile/vaginal intercourse.

98Far from desisting, the Applicant subjected the already humiliated and terrified victim to a further s.61J offence of a most serious type. These aspects served to magnify the objective gravity of the last offence.

99It was necessary for her Honour to consider the circumstances of each offence for the purposes of determining an appropriate level of concurrency and accumulation, and with totality in mind as well. The sentences as fixed involved overlapping sentences with a total term reflecting the concept of totality.

100Her Honour explained why the final s.61J offence was of greater objective seriousness, calculated a sentence for that offence and then determined the degree of partial accumulation of that sentence upon the other sentences.

101The actual measure of accumulation for the final s.61J offence involved a two-year extension of the effective non-parole period. It is difficult to see how this measure of accumulation constitutes double punishment contrary to the principles in Pearce v The Queen. Partial accumulation of this order was open to her Honour in sentencing the Applicant for these serious and repeated sexual assault offences.

102Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision: Pearce v The Queen at 624 [46]. It is highly undesirable that the process of sentencing should become any more technical than it is already: Pearce v The Queen at 622 [39].

103In this case, the selection of the individual sentence and the determination of the appropriate degree of accumulation did not, in my view, result in a situation where there was double punishment of the Applicant. No injustice has been demonstrated by the Applicant in the approach taken to sentencing for the final s.61J offence, nor in relation to considerations of accumulation and totality. No breach of the principles in Pearce v The Queen has been demonstrated. 

104I would reject Ground 2.

Ground 3 - Claim that the Sentences Were Unreasonable and/or Plainly Unjust

Submissions of the Parties

105Mr Gartelmann submitted that the sentences imposed for the offences of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent are disproportionate to their seriousness, relative to the applicable maximum penalty and the range of conduct falling within the offence provision: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 372 [31].

106The sentences reflect nominal starting points (before discount) of 13 years and four months for the first offence and 16 years for the second and third offences. The maximum penalty applicable for these offences was imprisonment for 20 years. 

107Whilst acknowledging that the offences were serious, it was submitted that their respective facts and circumstances did not warrant the assessment that they were above mid-range or, with respect to Offence 3, ""getting close to the worst case category"" (ROS16). 

108Whilst acknowledging that it was an aggravating feature of the offences that the Applicant was armed with a knife and that there was a real threat of violence, it was submitted that the actual violence used and the bodily harm inflicted were limited and that the conduct was not prolonged. It was submitted that neither the facts and circumstances of each offence, nor the additional criminality in the Form 1 indecent assault offence, warranted the nominal starting points for these sentences.

109Mr Gartelmann submitted that the subjective circumstances of the Applicant did not demand great weight being given to considerations of specific deterrence, retribution or protection of the community. He had no record of prior convictions for similar offending and had not previously been sentenced to imprisonment.

110It was submitted that, although each offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent involved a separate and discrete act, the same actual bodily harm occasioned to the victim established the statutory circumstance of aggravation for them all. 

111Whilst acknowledging that the fact that the offences were committed in the course of one episode did not require concurrent sentences, it was submitted that the extent to which they involved disparate conduct remained relevant in assessing the totality of the criminality involved. Whilst the robbery offence reflected discrete criminality, it was submitted that the sexual assault offences were neither disparate in nature, nor separated in place or time from one another, so that a greater level of concurrency was warranted.

112It was submitted for the Applicant that an overall sentence of imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of 12 years exceeded the boundaries of a reasonable exercise of discretion by reference to accumulation and the totality of the criminality involved in the offences. Counsel submitted that both the individual sentences for the offences of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, and the resultant overall sentence, were unreasonable and/or plainly unjust so that this Court should intervene and resentence the Applicant.

113The Crown submitted that it was necessary for the sentencing Judge to have regard to both the maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 10 years applicable to each of the s.61J offences. The Crown submitted that the assessments of the objective seriousness of the s.61J offences were open in the circumstances of the case.

114It was submitted that the discretionary assessment of the seriousness of the offences was not affected by error so that the finding ought not be lightly disturbed by this Court: Smith v R [2013] NSWCCA 209 at [50]-[51]. 

115The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had regard to the objective gravity of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the Applicant, and proceeded to sentence the Applicant in a manner that did not demonstrate error.

Decision

116An assessment of a ground of appeal claiming manifest excess requires consideration of all the matters that are relevant to fixing sentence: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 539 [59]. As the ground of appeal makes clear, it is necessary for the Applicant to demonstrate that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust. 

117It will assist at this point to refer to features of the offences which the sentencing Judge described as ""objectively serious factors"" (ROS14). These were as follows (ROS14-16):

""The first is that the complainant was vulnerable. Looking at all of the offences, this would have been nothing short of a completely terrifying ordeal and no doubt there would have been times, if not the whole time, that she thought that she was going to die.

Another serious aspect is that after having penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with her, without her consent, and ejaculating, he proceeded to do the same again. Perhaps after the first time she thought that her ordeal might have been over but it seems it was only halfway over.

I take into account as well that she had not in any way been irresponsible about her safety. She had not in any way placed herself in an unreasonable position where she had compromised her safety. The offence occurred at 8.30 pm in a city street where she or any citizen has the right to think that they can walk safely around without being attacked.

Of course, another serious aspect is the ongoing use of a knife. He used it to force her to abduct her down the laneway, he used it throughout the offences and he used it when he put it between her legs and cut her lower clothing, her underpants, her skirt and her stockings, and then he removed them.

Another aggravating factor of the charge itself is that the injuries did include a cut to her left hand, which was not an injury that were necessary to effect the actual offence being committed. It was something over and above that. She also suffered a graze on her left knee, bruising and abrasions on the back and general soreness. While there are cases where the injuries are worse, it cannot be accepted that he did not intend or at least was extremely reckless to her physical wellbeing generally speaking. In particular, I do not accept that he did not intend to cut her hand. It was submitted that this was not intentional. I reject that. Taking into account his deliberate conduct with the knife when the injury was inflicted, there was only one outcome and that is the injury would be suffered by the complainant. In one part of the reports he said that she cut her hand. That is not acceptable. He cut her hand. Perhaps this was merely a poor choice of words on his part.

Another serious aspect of the offences is that he threatened to stab her with the knife if she did not comply. He behaved in a way throughout the ordeal that was brutal and callous. He humiliated and degraded her in many ways, including the removal of the tampon.

He engaged in unprotected sex with her. In that regard, firstly, there is a real possibility of further actual physical injury to her in that he knew he had hepatitis C. He told the psychologist that he failed to bother to treat it because he was too busy taking drugs. It is a real possibility then that she might have contracted that disease. In addition, apart from that real possibility would have been in her mind the latent prospect that she could have contracted AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases, or fallen pregnant.

Another factor is that he ignored her pleas and her reasoning with him to stop.""

118These findings were not challenged in this Court. The findings were both open and appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

119These offences were of considerable objective gravity. A young woman who was walking home from work was accosted in the street by a stranger. The Applicant brandished a knife and threatened the victim. He forced her to go to a nearby laneway, no doubt to undertake the sexual attack which followed in a less visible location. 

120As the detailed recital of facts set out earlier reveals, the victim was subjected to a protracted and frightening experience, where actual force was used against her on a number of occasions, accompanied by threats and the commission of acts of indignity and sexual violation. 

121The Applicant left the victim lying in the street and fled without concern for her welfare. The additional offence of aggravated robbery involved the theft of her wallet, a final criminal act to be added to the sexual assaults which preceded it.

122The victim was, in substance, dragged off the street whilst she was going peacefully about her own business: R v Gill [2010] VSCA 67 at [52]. Using the terminology in Boney v R [2008] NSWCCA 165 at [106], this was a case where a victim walking on a street at night was seized by a complete stranger about whom she knew nothing and who, for all the victim knew, may well have killed her when the sexual assault was over. 

123Consideration of Stephens v R [2010] NSWCCA 93 at [58]-[64], and the sentencing decisions for s.61J offences there referred to, confirms the significant objective gravity of the three s.61J offences in this case, and the appropriateness of a lengthy term of imprisonment in cases of this type.

124The sentencing Judge had regard to the decisions in Boney v R and Stephens v R in passing sentence in this case (ROS14).

125The victim suffered substantially from the attack upon her, experiencing what will undoubtedly be long-term psychological injury. It was important that the sentences passed upon the Applicant recognised the harm done to the victim of these crimes: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

126It is noteworthy that the Applicant, after the commission of these offences, took steps to disguise his identity by the issue of a driver's licence in a different name and the removal of his beard, no doubt intended to reduce the prospect of his apprehension for these offences. As it happens, he did not succeed in this respect, and was apprehended upon his return from a holiday in Bali.

127The Applicant had a criminal history for a range of offences, although none of a sexual nature. 

128The Applicant's subjective case included several troubling aspects referred to by Dr Bench and Ms Case (see [53]-[57] above). The sentencing Judge observed that there ""are good reasons for real questions about the offender's prospects of rehabilitation, in particular the likelihood of his re-offending with respect to offences of this kind"" (ROS17). Reference was made to the Applicant's attitude towards women as reflected in the reports, with her Honour noting that those matters did not call for a more severe punishment but were to be taken into account in terms of his risk of reoffending and his prospects of rehabilitation (ROS17-18).

129Her Honour observed that general deterrence and specific deterrence were significant factors on sentence in this case (ROS18). 

130General deterrence is a most significant factor on sentence for offences of sexual violence committed against women, and in particular where offences are committed against a complete stranger selected by the offender in a public street. Specific deterrence was also important here. The Applicant was nearly 30 years old at the time of the offences. He was not a young man and the material before the sentencing Judge was troubling concerning his attitude towards women.

131Her Honour had regard to the protection of the community in passing sentence, noting that this was ""another factor of importance"" given the ""considerable reservations about his risk of re-offending"" (ROS18).

132It has been accepted that an assessment of an offender's risk of reoffending is necessarily imprecise where a lengthy sentence is imposed: Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [53]. However, regard should still be had by a sentencing Judge to the risk of reoffending and prospects of rehabilitation. Her Honour did so and these aspects did not assist the Applicant in this case.

133The Applicant was to be sentenced for several offences so that principles concerning concurrency, accumulation and totality fell to be applied. The sentencing Judge applied these principles in reaching a discretionary determination which was available to her on these issues. 

134In R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159, Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ said at 164-165 [18] that a sentencing court must take care when applying the totality principle, keeping in mind public confidence in the administration of justice which requires the Court to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of discount for multiple offending. This concept has direct application in a case such as this.

135The sentencing Judge declined to find ""special circumstances"". Further, her Honour stated expressly the intention that the effective balance of term should be one of three years, following an effective non-parole period of 12 years. Her Honour observed that the three-year period constituted ample time for the Applicant to be supervised on parole (ROS19). These were discretionary decisions which were open to the sentencing Judge.

136It may be acknowledged that the total effective sentence imposed upon the Applicant is a substantial one. However, his crimes of sexual violence and robbery against the victim were substantial, calling for lengthy terms of imprisonment to reflect the various purposes of sentencing. 

137I am not persuaded that the individual sentences, nor the total effective sentence, are unreasonable or plainly unjust. I would reject the submission that the sentences were manifestly excessive.

138Ground 3 should be rejected.

Conclusion

139As each ground of appeal has been rejected, no occasion arises for this Court to determine for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 whether other sentences were warranted. 

140If the occasion to resentence the Applicant had arisen, it would have been necessary to consider how to accommodate the series of entirely concurrent custodial sentences of imprisonment for periods of nine or 12 months, imposed at the Newcastle Local Court on 20 September 2012 (see [48] above). If the question of resentencing had arisen, then the necessary discretionary exercise concerning concurrency and accumulation would have called for consideration to be given to these concurrent sentences for unrelated crimes, imposed upon the Applicant after the sentences presently under challenge: cf Currie v R [2013] NSWCCA 267 at [92]-[95]. However, that point has not been reached on this application.

141I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

142I have had the opportunity to consider the judgment of RS Hulme AJ, about which I make two comments. 

143Firstly, I am not at all sure that the point considered by his Honour with respect to digital penetration was taken by the Applicant. There was no ground of appeal to this effect, nor was an argument advanced asserting error in this respect. In any event, I remain of the view reflected in my agreement with the judgment of Bellew J in Doe v R [2013] NSWCCA 248. See, as well, Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23 at [28]-[34]. I detect no error in the approach of the sentencing Judge, nor in the sentence imposed with respect to the first count under s.61J Crimes Act 1900. 

144Secondly, his Honour has concluded that there is nothing in the facts to suggest that the victim may have thought that her ordeal was over after the second s.61J offence, save for the fact of the Applicant's ejaculation. As the Agreed Statement of Facts made clear, the victim took steps at different points during the Applicant's offending conduct to accelerate the sexual progress of the event, no doubt as a result of the threat by the Applicant to otherwise stab her with a knife. The appropriate inference is that the victim was seeking to bring the ordeal to an end at the earliest possible time. The fact that the Applicant ejaculated would have led the victim to the reasonable conclusion that the Applicant's sexual urges would subside. After all, movement to this point appeared to be what the victim was seeking to accelerate. It was more than open to the sentencing Judge to infer that the victim considered that the sexual ordeal was over. However, the Applicant sustained his attack with a further offence. As indicated earlier (at [97]-[98]), a repeated sexual attack against an already traumatised victim serves to magnify the objective gravity of the final s.61J offence in this case. 

145RS HULME AJ: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Johnson J. His Honour has recorded the relevant facts and findings of Wells SC DCJ and I need not repeat them. I agree with his Honour that the first ground of appeal should fail and with his Honour's reasons for that conclusion. I am however unable to agree with his Honour as to the disposition of the remaining grounds of appeal.

146My first point of disagreement falls within a narrow compass and will have no impact on the effective sentence imposed on the Applicant. However, as the point has been taken and I consider that the sentencing Judge erred, I should say so. 

147My disagreement lies in the sentence imposed on the first count and with the relativity between that sentence and the sentence imposed on the second count. Those sentences were, respectively of 10 years including a non-parole period of seven years and six months and 12 years including a non-parole period of nine years. The first offence involved digital penetration of the complainant's vagina. The second involved penile penetration also of the vagina and ejaculation and this in circumstances where the Applicant knew he was infected with Hepatitis C. In the case of the second count, the circumstances included the Applicant forcing an open-mouth kiss on the complainant and there was also taken into account an offence of indecent assault.

148Prior to the offence the subject of the first count, the Applicant had forced the complainant into a secluded area in the circumstances detailed by Johnson J and cut her left hand. There was no corresponding or quasi-equivalent injury inflicted during the offence the subject of the second count. However, this circumstance seems to have played no part in her Honour's sentencing of the Applicant for one, rather than another count. The circumstance of aggravation relied on for each offence was actual bodily harm without further particularity and her Honour's treatment of this aspect was simply as follows:

""Of course, another serious aspect is the ongoing use of a knife. He used it to force her to abduct her down the laneway, he used it throughout the offences and he used it when he put it between her legs and cut her lower clothing, her underpants, her skirt and her stockings, and then he removed them.

Another aggravating factor of the charge itself is that the injuries did include a cut to her left hand, which was not an injury that were necessary to effect the actual offence being committed. It was something over and above that. She also suffered a graze to her left knee, bruising and abrasions on the back and general soreness. While there are cases where the injuries are worse, it cannot be accepted that he did not intend or at least was extremely reckless to her physical wellbeing generally speaking. In particular, I do not accept that he did not intend to cut her hand."" 

149The context in which this passage appears indicates that in her reference to ""charge"" her Honour was not confining her attention to the first count.

150In Doe v R [2013] NSWCCA 248, Bellew J, with the concurrence of Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J, observed at [54]:

""...it should be emphasised that there is no decision of this Court which supports the proposition that digital sexual intercourse is, of itself, less serious than some other form of forced sexual intercourse. Reference to the above authorities demonstrates that it has been emphasised, on more than one occasion, that the objective seriousness of offending is to be determined according to the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case in question. Concentrating upon, or giving primary significance to, the form of the forced sexual intercourse in determining its objective seriousness reflects an erroneous approach. It is equally erroneous to attempt to rank forms of forced sexual intercourse in some hierarchy so as to determine their objective seriousness.""

151With respect to his Honour, I think he meant ""necessarily"" when he said, ""of itself"". If not, he was wrong because in R v Da Silva (NSWCCA, 30 November 1995, unreported) Grove J, whose judgment was concurred in by Gleeson CJ and Ireland J, observed:

""Third it is submitted that an act of digital penetration is less serious than an offence of, for example, penile penetration. Generally I would agree that this is likely to be so.""

152Furthermore in R v O [2005] NSWCCA 327, Sully J, with whom Hidden and Hall JJ agreed said at [32]-[33]:

""I would accept that, as a general proposition, an act of digital penetration, as such, is less serious than an act of penile penetration as such.""

The passage just quoted was also quoted by Bellew J.

153Of course there are other cases that deal with the issue including R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20; 194 A Crim R 1 and MH v R [2011] NSWCCA 230 but it is unnecessary that I attempt a comprehensive discourse on the topic here. 

154If, as Wells SC DCJ seems to have done, one treats the Applicant's non-sexual violence as simply applicable to all of his offences, and assesses ""the objective seriousness of offending ... according to the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case in question"", as Doe v R, and R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 at [36] require, the objective seriousness of the offence the subject of the second count was substantially worse than that of the first offence. The second offence carried with it a risk of pregnancy, some, perhaps small, risk of Hepatitis C, and what one may expect, and her Honour concluded likely, fear by the complainant of one or other of these conditions or other venereal disease. 

155(I should perhaps add that treating the Applicant's non-sexual violence as applicable to all his offences as her Honour seems to have done, runs the risk that it will be the subject of double or triple punishment, an event which should not occur - see Pearce v The Queen at 623 [40]-[49]; R v Hilton [2005] NSWCCA 317; 157 A Crim R 504. Those cases make it clear that concurrency of sentences is not a sufficient answer to the problem but the point was not taken in the appeal and in the circumstances I need not take it further).

156Even disregarding the concern just expressed, in my view the sentence for the first count was manifestly excessive and it should be reduced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of six years and total sentence of eight years, both such periods commencing on 11 August 2012, that is, twothirds of the sentence for a significantly more serious offence.

157Although heavy - about half of the sentences commonly given to murderers - I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed for the Applicant's second offence was outside the legitimate exercise of Wells SC DCJ's sentencing discretion.

158My second point of disagreement lies in the sentence imposed for the third sexual intercourse offence and in Wells SC DCJ's reasoning that led to that sentence. In relation to that offence her Honour said:

""Another serious aspect is that after having penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with her, without her consent, and ejaculating, he proceeded to do the same again. Perhaps after the first time she thought that her ordeal might have been over but it seems it was only halfway over. 

... I note that getting close to the worst case category is the second penile vaginal intercourse offence in the context of what had preceded it.""

159There is nothing in the account of the facts to suggest that the complainant thought her ordeal might have been over save for the fact of the Applicant's ejaculation. However, that seems to have been immediately followed by his request for the complainant to ""try to make me hard. I want to see your tits"" and other sexual activity. Furthermore, I am unable to see how this further offence is made worse than it otherwise would have been by ""the context of what had preceded it"" and which amounted to the foundation for the first and second counts and the indecent assault offence placed on a Form 1. In the sentences imposed for the first and second sexual assault charges, the Applicant was being punished for the conduct that amounted to that foundation and her Honour's approach was to double count that conduct. 

160In that the Applicant did not ejaculate during the commission of the third offence under s.61J, and seems to have voluntarily desisted during the currency of it, this offence was less objectively serious than the second and her Honour's view that it was ""getting close to the worst case category"" was erroneous. It should be noted also that there was no Form 1 offence to be taken into account in connection with the third offence as there had been with the second. 

161While it was appropriate on account of the third offence to add something to the effective sentence, the sentence for that third offence should have been substantially less than that imposed for the second. And while I do not suggest that the effects of the Applicant's earlier threat and violence had dissipated, it is also of significance that the cut that the victim had suffered in consequence of the Applicant's threats and use of a knife had occurred during the first offence and her other actual bodily harm, being a graze to her left knee, bruising and abrasions to her back and general soreness is likely to have also occurred mainly prior to the third offence. It would be wrong to punish him again for elements of his earlier offending.

162The sentence for the third offence should be reduced to imprisonment for five years. It seems likely that her Honour's decision to extend the Applicant's effective non-parole period by two years on account of the third offence was also influenced by her erroneous view of its seriousness and this period should be reduced.

163Unless the order in which sentences commenced is changed, because of considerations of totality I would structure the sentence for the third offence so that one year was added to the effective non-parole period, and the Applicant has three years when he is eligible for parole. Given mine is a minority view, I do not need to further formulate what I would do.

		25 July 2014",2014-07-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764422,SM v R [2014] NSWCCA 137,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J.

2SIMPSON J: I agree with Hall J.

3HALL J: The applicant, SM, by Notice dated and filed on 23 September 2013, seeks leave to appeal against a total effective sentence of imprisonment of 7 years 9 months commencing on 22 March 2013 and expiring on 21 December 2020, with a total non-parole period of 3 years 9 months expiring on 21 December 2016 imposed by the District Court on 22 March 2013.

4The applicant entered guilty pleas to the following offences:

Count 1: Assault female and commit act of indecency (s.76 of the Crimes Act 1900);

Count 2: Assault female and commit act of indecency (s.76 of the Crimes Act 1900);

Count 3: Assault female and commit act of indecency (s.76 of the Crimes Act 1900);

Count 4: Assault female and commit act of indecency (s.76 of the Crimes Act 1900);

Count 5: Assault female and commit act of indecency (s.76 of the Crimes Act 1900);

Count 6: Assault female and commit act of indecency (s.76 of the Crimes Act 1900);

Count 7: Carnal Knowledge (s.67 of the Crimes Act 1900);

Count 8: Carnal Knowledge (s.67 of the Crimes Act 1900);

Count 9: Sexual assault (cat 4) assault and commit act of indecency (s.61E(1) of the Crimes Act 1900); and

Count 10: Sexual assault (cat 4) assault and commit act of indecency (s.61E(1) of the Crimes Act 1900).

5There were four matters on a Form 1 involving Assault Female and Commit Act of Indecency, contrary to s 76 Crimes Act 1900 occurring in the period 1 September 1977 to 31 December 1979 to be taken into account in respect of Count 7. 

6On 22 March 2013 the applicant was sentenced as follows:

Count 1: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months commencing on 22 March 2013 and expiring on 21 September 2013;

Count 2: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 22 April 2013 and expiring on 21 April 2014; 

Count 3: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 22 May 2013 and expiring on 21 May 2014;

Count 4: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 22 June 2013 and expiring on 21 December 2014;

Count 5: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years commencing on 22 July 2013 and expiring on 21 July 2015;

Count 6: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years commencing on 22 August 2013 and expiring on 21 August 2015;

Count 9: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years commencing on 22 September 2013 and expiring on 21 September 2015;

Count 10: Sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months commencing on 22 December 2013 and expiring on 21 June 2014;

Count 7: Sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 22 November 2013, with an additional term of 3 years to expire on 21 November 2019; and

Count 8: Sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 22 December 2013, with an additional term of 4 years to expire on 21 December 2020.

7The offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty occurred between September 1977 and December 1983.

8The maximum penalty for an offence Assault Female Contrary to s 76 Crimes Act 1900 was 6 years imprisonment; for an offence of Carnal Knowledge contrary to s 67 Crimes Act was penal servitude for life; and for an offence of Indecent Assault contrary to s 61E(1) Crimes Act was 6 years imprisonment.

9The applicant was allowed a 25% discount on sentence in respect of his guilty pleas. The total effective sentence imposed of 7 years 9 months with an effective non-parole period of 3 years 9 months reflects an alteration of the statutory ratio to 48.4%. This, the Crown observed, reflects the sentencing practices for historical offences and special circumstances.

10The Crown further observed that there was an error in charging the applicant in relation to the offence (identified as Sequence 14, being Count 9) with an offence of indecent assault pursuant to s 61E(1) Crimes Act with a maximum penalty of 6 years. The offence was constituted by an act of fellatio which at that time was within the definition of sexual intercourse and the appropriate charge was s 61D(1) Crimes Act with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The penalty imposed by the sentencing judge for this offence was a 2 year fixed term commencing on 22 September 2013 and expiring on 21 September 2015. Due to the structure of the sentences imposed, this does not have any operational or practical effect, being within the period covered by the accumulation of other sentences.

11The applicant relied upon five grounds of appeal in the following terms:

""1. Her Honour erred in finding that the delay in this matter was not a mitigating factor.

2. Her Honour erred in failing to take into account the likelihood that the applicant would serve his sentence in protective custody.

3. Her Honour erred in failing to reduce the sentences imposed on account of past assistance to the authorities.

4. Her Honour erred in failing to properly take into account the youthfulness of the applicant.

5. The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive having regard to the sentencing practice at the time of the offending.""

The Agreed Facts on Sentence

12Whilst the sentencing judge when formulating the sentences stated that he took the Form 1 matters into account in relation to the offence the subject of Count 8 instead of Count 7, given the structure of the sentences imposed including in particular the substantial concurrency between the sentences imposed in respect of Counts 7 and 8, there is no basis upon which the error could be said to have given rise to any practical injustice or disadvantage to the applicant and no argument was in fact directed to that aspect.

13The Crown tendered a number of documents at the sentencing hearing (Exhibit A) which included an Agreed Statement of Facts.

14The applicant's date of birth is 21 June 1963. The victim was the applicant's stepsister. The victim's parents separated in 1976 when she was four years of age. Between August 1977 and November 1977 the victim's mother and her two older brothers moved in with her mother's new partner who had three children including the applicant then aged 14 years.

15The victim's mother married her partner in 1978. The offences commenced in September 1977 when the victim was aged 5. They ceased in December 1983 when the victim was aged 11 years and the applicant was aged between 19 and 20.

16I reproduce below the Agreed Facts part of Exhibit A in the proceedings before the District Court so far as the individual offences are concerned:

Offence - Indecent Assault-s.76 [FORM 1]

5. On a day between 1 September 1977 and 31 December 1977 the Accused (then aged 14) took the Victim (then aged 5) into his bedroom. While they were alone the Accused touched the Victim's vagina and rubbed her clitoris very hard. This resulted in her vagina becoming red and swollen.

6. While he did this he asked the victim, ""How does that feel? Do you like it? The victim recalls that this was the first time this offence occurred. The Accused then threatened her by saying words similar to ""If you tell anyone, youse will have to move out. Do you want that? Do you want to lose your sisters? Do you want your family to have nowhere to live?

7. As a result the victim felt threatened and did not tell anyone what the Accused did to her, she feared that it would cause the break up of the family.

8. After this first incident, the Accused repeated the same acts of touching the Victim's vagina, at times, about twice a week.

Offence - Indecent Assault-s.76 [Count 1] 

9. On a day between 1 October 1977 and 31 January 1978, a few weeks after the first incident, the Accused (then aged 14) took the Victim (then aged 5) into the home office. The Accused placed the Victim's hand over his penis and got her to rub her hands backwards and forwards along the length of his penis.

Offence -Indecent Assault-s.76 [Count 2]

10. The offence occurred on a day between 1 October 1977 and 31 January 1978, when the victim (then aged 5) and the Accused (then aged 14) were both in the home office.

11. The Accused asked the Victim to remove her clothing. She did, and he then inserted two fingers and then three fingers into her vagina. She experienced pain when he did this.

12. The victim specifically recalls this was the first time the Accused penetrated her with three fingers because it hurt much more than on the occasions when he had inserted two fingers.

Offence -Indecent Assault-s.76 [FORM 1]

13. Between 1 November 1977 and 31 March 1978 the Accused (then aged 14) took the Victim (then aged 5) into the home office.

14. The Accused inserted three of his fingers into the Victim's vagina. The Victim recalls that on this occasion the accused stopped when the Victim screamed out in pain.

Offence - Indecent Assault-s.76 [Count 3]

15. Within the next couple of weeks, on a day between 1 November 1977 and 31 March 1978 while the Accused (then aged 14) and Victim (then aged 5) were in the home office, the Accused again inserted his fingers into the complainant's vagina. Victim screamed out ""Stop, Stop it really hurts. I don't like it"". The Accused stopped. He then penetrated with his fingers the Victim's vagina again and made her rub his penis until he ejaculated.

Offence -Indecent Assault-s.76 [Count 4]

16. A few months later, on a day between 1 January 1978 and 31 July 1978, the Accused spoke to the Victim about oral sex and told her he wanted her to 'suck his penis'. He told her when his 'penis was in her mouth that he wanted to feel her teeth softly rubbing on his penis'.

17. The Accused (then aged between 14-15) forced the victim (then aged between 5-6) to kneel down on the floor while he remained standing. He pushed the back of her head forward until his whole penis was in her mouth. At the same time, he thrust himself backward and forwards towards the Victim's mouth. The Victim felt she couldn't breathe. She tried to get her head away and get his penis out of her mouth. The Accused kept pushing the Victim's head forward onto his penis.

18. The Victim said she was gagging and vomiting but the Accused continued. The victim said she vomited from the sides of her mouth and had to swallow part of the vomit because the Accused continued to force his penis inside her mouth to her throat. He continued until he ejaculated inside her mouth and on her face.

19. This occurred on an almost daily basis.

Offence -Indecent Assault-s.76 [FORM 1]

20. Between 1 August 1979 and 31 August 1979 the family had professional family photographs taken at their home. Before the photographs were taken, the Accused (then aged 16) took the Victim (then aged 7) into his bedroom and closed the door.

21. The Accused forced the Victim to perform fellatio on him. The Victim knelt down on the floor while the Accused stood in front of her and put his penis inside her mouth. He pushed her head back and forth until he heard someone near by.

Offence -Indecent Assault-s.76 [Count 5]

22. On a day between 1 January 1979 and 31 December 1979, the Accused (then aged between 15-16) introduced the Victim (then aged between 6-7) to the act of performing cunnilingus and fellatio simultaneously (the act described as '69') and forced the Victim to participate.

23. On this occasion, whilst in the home office, the Accused instructed the Victim to remove her clothing and lay on top of him lay on top of him, opposite to his face and face his penis. When the Victim did not grasp his instructions, the Accused got angry and yelled at her.

24. After the Victim realised what she had to do, the Accused instructed the Victim to suck his penis the way that she does standing up. Whilst Victim continued to perform fellatio, the Accused performed Cunnilingus by licking the Victim's vagina.

25. This continued for a period of time until the Accused was about to ejaculate, he asked the Victim to turn around and he ejaculated on her lower back.

Offence -Indecent Assault-s.76 [Count 6]

26. The Victim recalls that oral sex occurred on a daily basis, but that mutual oral sex (the act described as '69') occurred about once per fortnight.

27. About a week after the first instance of mutual oral sex, on a day between 1 January 1979 and 31 December 1979, the Accused (then aged between 15-16) was in his bedroom with the Victim (then aged between 6-7). At his direction a further act of mutual oral sex occurred.

28. This was followed by the accused telling the victim to get on her knees and continue to perform fellatio upon him while he remained standing. The Victim continued until the Accused ejaculated inside the Victim's mouth and over her face.

Offence - Indecent Assault-s.76 [FORM 1]

29. On a day between 1 January 1979 and 31 December 1979, the Accused (then aged between 15-16) sat opposite the Victim (then aged between 6-7) at the dining table at dinner time. He, placed his bare foot under the table between the Victim's legs. He was able to push her underwear aside and insert his toe into her vagina and rub, her clitoris.

30. The Victim was shocked as this was the first time the Accused penetrated her with people around.

Offence - Carnal Knowledge-s.67 [Count 7]

31. After the accused returned to the family home after a short absence he asked the Victim ""Have you had a period yet?"", the victim replied ""No, Why?"".

32. On a day shortly after that conversation, between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1981, the Accused (then aged between 16-18) and the Victim (then aged between 7-9) were in the home office.

33. The Accused closed the door and told the victim to lay on her stomach on the floor behind the door. He then bent over the top of the victim and lifted her up so she was on her hands and knees.

34. The Accused then inserted his erect penis inside the Victim's vagina and thrust himself backwards and forwards causing her to yell out in pain. She tried to crawl away from the Accused but he held her around the waist and continued to have intercourse with her.

35. The Victim was crying and the Accused said, ""It won't be long, not much longer"". After some time, the Accused removed his penis and ejaculated all over the Victim's lower back. The Accused then wiped the Victim's back with a cloth.

36. The Accused tried to console the Victim but then he told her ""if she ever told anyone about what he had done the family would be separated"". Upon hearing this the Victim felt scared and frightened.

Offence -Carnal Knowledge-s.67 [Count 8]

37. The accused continued to perform oral sex on the victim on almost a daily basis. On a day between 1 February 1980 and 1 July 1982 the Accused (then aged between 16-19) called the Victim (then aged between 7-9) to his bedroom.

38. The Accused told the Victim to lay on her stomach on the floor and told her what he wanted her to do to him. The Victim told the Accused that she didn't want him to do it to her.

39. The Accused told the Victim that he wouldn't put his penis in as far this time, so it wouldn't hurt. The Victim insisted she didn't want to do it but then complied and laid on the floor.

40. The Accused lifted the Victim up on to her hands and knees and inserted his penis into her vagina and thrust backwards and forwards for a period of time.

Offence -Indecent AssauIt-s.61E (1) [Count 9]

41. On a night between 1 January 1983 and 31 December 1983 in the front lounge room, the Victim (then aged between 10-11) was on her knees performing fellatio on the Accused (then aged between 19-20).

42. As the Victim was performing fellatio, the Victim's stepsister ... (then aged 15) walked in and witnessed the incident. The Victim recalls [her stepsister] screamed when she saw them and ran out the room.

Offence -Indecent Assault-s.61E (1) [Count 10]

43. On a day between 1 January 1983 and 31 December 1983 while in the Accused's (then aged between 19-20) bedroom he told the Victim (then aged between 10-11) to remove her upper body clothing.

44. The Victim took off her top off and the accused asked her to lay on her back on the floor.

45. While the Victim lay on the floor the Accused straddled by placing his knees on the floor beside her waist. He then pulled the Victim's breasts together tightly and placed his penis between her breasts and moved it backward and forward between them.

Complaint

46. The Victim says she first complained about the abuse to her childhood friend [JF] and her cousin [LK]. Both are now deceased.

47. The Victim says that when she was 7 or 8 years of age she also told a close childhood friend [TK] that ""Stephen hurts me"". When the victim and [TK] were 19 years old the Victim told her that she had been molested by the Accused.

48. The Victim says she told her cousin [LR] on a day between 1984 and 1985 that ""Stephen touched me in places that I don't like "".

Admissions

49. Two telephone conversations between the Victim and Accused were lawfully intercepted.

50. The first conversation took place on 21 July 2009. Because of a technical malfunction only the Victim's side of the conversation was recorded. However the Victim said the Accused admitted to wrong-doing of some kind, without being specific. According to the Victim the Accused said he does not remember much about that time in his life, but then said: [SM] (the accused sister) won't have anything to do with him because of it, he doesn't want to have children because of it, he hasn't done it to anyone else, and his uncle did it to him.

51. The second conversation took place on 11 August 2009. Both parties were recorded. The Accused said he felt that he was facing his demons after the earlier conversation and that what he did to her turned him into something he didn't like. He said he ""fucked up"" the Victim's life. He said, ""I've shared the fact that I was, I molested my step sister with many many people"". When asked why he selected the victim, he conceded it was because ""you're an easy target"". He denied doing anything that could have made the victim pregnant, and said ""There was only one occasion where I actually tried to enter you"". He agreed with the comment, ""There were a lot of oral stuff'.

52. In a recorded conversation with the Victim on 22 July 2009, the Accused father, [RM], states the Accused admitted the allegations were true.

53. Sometime in the middle of 1994 when the Victim's mother [DM] found out about the abuse she confronted the Accused. She grabbed the Accused by the front of the shirt and said ""You've been interfering with my daughter"". The Accused cried and said ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry"".

54. The accused was then arrested on the 5 April 2012 and charged.

The Grounds of Appeal

Ground 1: Her Honour erred in finding that the delay in this matter was not a mitigating factor

17In her remarks, the sentencing judge observed:

""... There has been a considerable delay between the commission of these offence[s] and sentence. The delay has not necessarily worked to the advantage of the offender as he has had a troubled life for many years.

These matters were raised with him in the early 1990s. He must surely have realised the possibility of the victim coming forward and making a formal complaint. He had an opportunity then to make a complete disclosure of the extent of his criminality. He clearly chose not to do so, although he was before the courts on many, many occasions and, no doubt, would have had ample opportunity to raise with his lawyers over the years what he knew about his conduct between the ages of fourteen and twenty. Perhaps he hoped the matter would simply go away, yet he knew full well the consequences for him because of what had happened to his uncle who had sexually assaulted him.

This is not a matter, in my view, where delay mitigates the penalty. The sentencing of offenders for historical sexual assaults is always a difficult task. These offences were committed between 1977 and 1983. For some of that time the offender was under the age of eighteen; indeed, even under the age of sixteen ..."". (Remarks on Sentence at pp 21-22).

18In the written submissions for the applicant it was noted that the victim's mother confronted the applicant regarding his offending conduct in the early 1990s and that lawfully intercepted telephone conversations between the victim's mother and the applicant took place in July and August 2009 in which the applicant admitted to some kind of ""wrong-doing"".

19The applicant was arrested and charged on 5 April 2012.

20It was submitted for the applicant that a substantial delay ought to have been taken into account as a mitigating factor.

21Mr McLachlan of counsel, who appeared in this Court on behalf of the applicant, in his oral submissions referred to the agreed facts which recorded two lawfully intercepted telephone conversations having taken place, on 21 July 2009 and 11 August 2009. The applicant made admissions in the second of those two conversations: Agreed Facts at [51].

22Mr McLachlan observed that it was then almost three years before the applicant's arrest on 5 April 2012: Agreed Facts at [54]. The submission on this ground was said to be that the latter period of ""delay"" subsequent to the victim's mother raising the allegations with him, and the almost three years delay before the applicant was charged, represented overall a considerable delay during which the applicant would have been left in a state of ""uncertain suspense as to what would happen to him and it wasn't a case of him being content to remain silent in that regard ..."": T 2, 11 December 2013.

23As to the absence of evidence from the applicant of him having lived in ongoing suspense or uncertainty of whether he would be prosecuted, Mr McLachlan relied upon the report of Ms Anita Duffy, psychologist, dated 5 February 2013, and the references that were tendered which referred to the applicant being ""relieved that it was all final [sic] all out in the open"" In Mr McLachlan's submission ""... the inference can be drawn from that is that he was in a certain degree of what's referred to as uncertain suspense"": T 2.

24In my assessment, Ground 1 may be readily dealt with on two bases. First, I do not consider that there was evidence that the applicant was left in a ""state of uncertain suspense"" of the kind referred to by Street CJ in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519. I have taken into account the report of Ms Duffy in so concluding. I do not consider that that report provides any assistance to the applicant on this ground. Second, there was no delay of the kind referred to in Todd, supra, arising from the operation of the criminal justice system such that the applicant's fate or position was not determined for many years. 

25Finally, as the Crown observed, the applicant had the benefit of any delay resulting in findings that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.

26There was, in my opinion, no error in the sentencing judge's finding that delay did not mitigate the penalty. This ground should be dismissed.

Ground 2: Her Honour erred in failing to take into account the likelihood that the applicant would serve his sentence in protective custody

27In relation to this ground, there is a question as to whether the issue of protective custody was raised in submissions before the sentencing judge.

28In this respect, Mr McLachlan drew attention to two matters. The first was the applicant's evidence before the sentencing judge on the issue of protective custody the evidence was brief. It was as follows:

""Q. If you were to receive a term of imprisonment for these offences, what is your attitude in relation to protective custody?
A. I would be seeking it.

Q. And that's on what basis?
A. Basis of the, the nature of the crimes and also because I've been in protective custody before."" (T 4, 14 February 2013)

29In the written submissions for the applicant in this Court, it was stated that the issue of the applicant serving his custodial sentence in protective custody was otherwise raised in submissions. However, the only reference cited in this respect was a reference to protective custody in the Crown's written submissions before the sentencing judge at p 17. There, the Crown referred to the fact that it was not known if the applicant would be placed in protective custody and that there was no evidence before the court regarding his likely status if that were to happen. In particular, the Crown noted that there was no evidence of the implications of such custody for the applicant's rehabilitation and ability to enrol in courses: Crown's Sentence Submissions at p 17.

30The applicant sought leave at the hearing in this Court to rely upon fresh evidence concerning his conditions of custody since being incarcerated, in particular, to the applicant's affidavit affirmed on 4 December 2013 and the affidavit of Bryan Dowe, solicitor, also declared and affirmed on 4 December 2013. 

31The applicant's affidavit stated that he had been in limited association protection, which means he has limited access to programs, education and work.

32Mr Dowe annexed to his affidavit a copy of a letter from the Contract Compliance Manager of the correctional institution where the applicant is presently held. This confirmed that the applicant was then unemployed due to his PRLA status and his listed medical conditions (a copy of extracts from the Justice Health file were attached to the letter).

33In circumstances in which the applicant did not seek during the sentencing hearing to adduce evidence as to (1) the likelihood of him being placed in protective custody; (2) his likely status if placed in protective custody, or (3) as to the likely position in terms of his rehabilitation or the ability to enrol in courses, and there having been an absence of submissions on any such matters, I do not consider that his abovementioned affidavit evidence, or that of Mr Dowe, can be considered to constitute ""fresh"" evidence.

34Further, the absence at the sentencing hearing of any attempt in the submissions for the applicant to identify, as a matter to be taken into account on sentence, particular factors bearing upon his custodial conditions, as a matter of discretion, weighs against the grant of leave for the applicant to rely upon the affidavit evidence. 

35In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 it was observed, at [80]:

""There is a practical expectation that an offender's legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing Judge at first instance, by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in mitigation of sentence in the case at hand: Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [11]; Dyer v R [2011] NSWCCA 185 at [49].""

36It is sufficient to resolve the issue as to whether leave should be granted upon the basis on which it was argued, namely, the contention that the evidence constitutes fresh evidence. In the circumstances of this case to which I have referred this is not one wherein the evidence was unavailable or could not have been obtained and placed before the sentencing judge. The evidence sought to be placed before this Court is not fresh evidence and in my opinion leave to admit it in the present proceedings should be refused.

37I consider that this ground is without merit and should be dismissed.

Ground 3: Her Honour erred in failing to reduce the sentence imposed on account of past assistance to the authorities

38Mr McLachlan properly accepted that this was not a matter upon which any submission was made to the sentencing judge and he acknowledged that the principle stated in Zreika, supra, accordingly applies to this ground. However, Mr McLachlan argued that the ""evidential foundation"" for the ground was clearly raised and it was not insignificant in terms of the sentencing of the applicant: T 3, 11 December 2013.

39The evidence relied upon for this ground was that given by the applicant at the sentencing hearing on 14 February 2013 at T 10:16-46. The evidence was to the effect that he had made a statement to police in relation to the abuse of him by one of his uncles, who was subsequently charged and later was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the offences committed against the applicant. He said he went to police and reported the matter in 1974 or 1975. He did not recall going to court and giving evidence about the offences to which he referred.

40Mr McLachlan stated that ""some allowance"" should have been made for past assistance to the authorities but did not suggest it would be a ""significant allowance"": T 3, 11 December 2013.

41The Crown submitted that as no submissions were made to the sentencing judge on any discount for past assistance, this ground amounts to a ""reformulation of the case"": Crown's Written Submissions at [16].

42The Crown referred to the observations made by the majority in RJT v R [2012] NSWCCA 280 to the effect that a victim who assists by reporting the offence in question is able to receive a discount on sentence pursuant to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However, the Court there also observed that the availability of a discount and its level in such a case ""should await a case in which they squarely arise"": at [11].

43I do not consider in the circumstances of this case where no submission was made to the sentencing judge on the matter of past assistance, that any appellable error has been established in relation to this ground. Accordingly, Ground 3 should be dismissed.

Ground 4: Her Honour erred in failing to properly take into account the youthfulness of the applicant

44Whilst it was argued that the sentencing judge failed to properly take into account the youthfulness of the applicant, it was conceded that her Honour was ""mindful of the general position"" in relation to the sentencing of young offenders: T 3, 11 December 2013.

45In the written submissions for the applicant it was observed:

""When dealing with the issue of the young age of the applicant at the time of the commissions of the offences, her Honour prefaced her findings as follows (at page 15):

'It is often said that where youthful immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence, then it may fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years, because of an inability to recognise the unacceptable nature of the behaviour ...'

However, her Honour then held (at page 15):

'... I find that the same cannot be said in the circumstances of this case. As I have just alluded to, the perpetrator of the sexual offences against this offender had been sent to gaol about two years prior. That is something which must have been in the forefront of his mind, even if he was acting out.

And, even if I am wrong in that regard, certainly by the time he was committing the more serious offences of carnal knowledge upon her, he would have matured significantly and been able to come to the realisation that his behaviour was unacceptable and was wrong and he should have been able to exercise a far greater degree of self-control ...'

The applicant was a victim of sexual assault between the age of 6 & 10 years old. He first committed an offence on [the victim] when he was only 14 years old."" (Applicant's Written Submissions at [21]-[23])

46The submission was then made that to attribute to the applicant, as a 14 year old boy, the same level of maturity and insight as might be ascribed to a male of, say, 40 years of age, simply because of the applicant's prior experience as a reported victim of sexual abuse, was a failure to give proper weight to the very immaturity and lack of insight inherent in young people of that age: Applicant's Written Submissions at [24].

47It was submitted:

""Furthermore, the 'more serious offences of carnal knowledge' was said to have occurred when the applicant was between the ages of 16 & 18 years old and between the ages of 16 & 19 years respectively. No further consideration was given by her Honour as to precisely when those two offences occurred or what was the exact age of the applicant at the time of such offences - nor could there be, other than to note the difficulty involved (RoS page 23).

But to proceed upon the basis that the applicant was somehow much, much older when these offences occurred in that he had 'matured significantly' by this time was not open to find on the facts beyond reasonable doubt. Indeed, it was equally as likely that the applicant was just 16 years of age when those offences occurred.

Such an approach to the carnal knowledge offences further demonstrates her Honour's failure to give proper weight to the youthfulness of the applicant."" (Applicant's Written Submissions at [26]-[28])

48The Crown's submission was, firstly, that the sentencing judge referred to the appropriate principles for sentencing in relation to offences committed by an offender as a juvenile. Secondly, having referred to those principles, her Honour then made findings that were open to her particularly in light of the applicant's admissions as to his knowledge and understanding, as detailed in the psychological pre-sentence assessment and the report of Ms Duffy, psychologist.

49I do not consider that the pre-sentence report dated 11 February 2013 refers to any matters that assist in establishing the level of the applicant's understanding and appreciation of the gravity of his offending conduct in the period from 1977 to 1983.

50However, the report of Ms Duffy is of assistance on those matters. It is to be borne in mind that whilst the applicant was aged between about 14 to 20 years at the time of his offending, the victim was only a very young child, between about 5 to 11 years. The applicant's offending was regular, almost systematic, carried out with threats being made to the victim from time to time warning her not to report his conduct. Ms Duffy noted, importantly, the applicant's frank admissions as to his level of insight of his wrongdoing, not only in retrospect many years after the offences occurred, but at the time he committed them. 

51In addition, it was observed in the Psychological Pre-sentence Assessment prepared by Ms Kate Solomon and Ms Katherine Sahm, under the subheading ""Attitude to offences and acceptance of responsibility"" that:

""[The applicant] took full responsibility for his offending behaviour. He acknowledged that he had sexually abused his stepsister. He stated that at the time he knew his behaviour was wrong, and he experienced a lot of negative feelings after he offended which he tried to ignore ... Furthermore [the applicant] stated that as an adolescent he had a high sex drive, 'I was consumed by sex' and therefore by abusing his stepsister he did not have to get a girlfriend in order to be sexually gratified; he stated that the offending 'became a habit'."" (pp 2-3)

52The findings of Hislop J in RJP v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 149 were referred to by the Crown as apposite for this case.

""26 ... from the pattern of repeat offending over many years that any immaturity by reason of his age at the time of the first offence was not a significant contributing factor to the offence as, with admitted knowledge that his behaviour was unacceptable, he persisted with such behaviour for many years thereafter."" (Crown's Written Submissions at [20])

53In light of the approach taken by the sentencing judge, based upon a recognition by her of the principles to be applied to juvenile offenders to the facts of this case, I do not consider that appellable error has been established. Ground 4 should be dismissed.

Ground 5: The sentences imposed are manifestly excessive having regard to the sentencing practice at the time of the offending

54In order to establish this ground the applicant is required to establish that the sentences, in particular the total effective sentence, was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 371 [25].

55It is firstly to be noted that the sentencing judge imposed fixed sentences in respect of the six offences under s 76 and in respect of the two offences under s 61E(1) Crimes Act. All such offences carried a maximum penalty of 6 years imprisonment.

56Secondly, there was a high degree of concurrency in relation to the sentences imposed with respect to all offences except Count 10 (the second offence charged under s 61E(1) which was made fully concurrent with Count 8 (an offence under s 67 Crimes Act), the latter offence being a most serious offence for which a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 22 December 2013 was imposed with a balance of term of 4 years expiring on 21 December 2020.

57Thirdly, the offence, Count 7, was also a serious offence under s 67 Crimes Act but was only accumulated by one month on the sentence for Count 8.

58The sentences for all such offences are summarised at [6] above.

59The submissions for the applicant commenced by analysing the sentences imposed by way of fixed terms which are to be taken as representing non-parole periods. On the analysis it was observed by Mr McLachlan that there would then be a need to increase the sentences to adjust for the 25% discount allowed for the applicant's early guilty pleas to determine the notional pre-discount non-parole period.

60It was then submitted that these notional non-parole periods would represent between one-third to one half of the starting head sentences as acknowledged in Bradbery v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 93, given the pattern of sentences at the time: Bradbery at [28]-[38].

61The submission on the above bases for the counts for which fixed terms were imposed of, say, 18 months or more, was that the notional starting point for the head sentence was either the actual statutory maximum penalty itself of 6 years imprisonment or even higher. With a fixed term of 2 years, it was observed, this would become 32 months after the 25% discount is added back. If that represented one-third of the head sentence, then the sentencing judge had started with a head sentence of imprisonment of 8 years (before allowing for the discount for the plea) for an offence that carried a maximum penalty of only 6 years imprisonment.

62The Crown, on the other hand, responded by stating that if the applicable range was one half to one-third then it would be appropriate to consider the notional starting point if the non-parole period was half the total sentence. The Crown produced a table to show the result: Crown's Written Submissions at [23].

63For reasons set out below, I do not consider that the competing exercises undertaken in the submissions for the applicant and the Crown directed at reconstructing notional starting points especially in respect of Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10 (all fixed term sentences), assist in determining whether the sentences and the way they were structured resulted in manifestly excessive sentences individually or overall. What needs to be kept in focus is the gravity of each of the offences.

64Counts 2 and 3 involved acts of digital penetration causing pain to a five-year-old. They were serious offences.

65Counts 4, 5, 6 and 9 were indecent assault offences involving acts of fellatio and cunnilingus and were all objectively serious offences - at least middle range and probably at the higher end of the range, and would have been so considered for sentencing purposes as at the time of their commission. Count 4 occurred when the victim was five years old and involved aggravating features including the use of some force on the victim. Counts 5 and 6 involved simultaneous acts of fellatio and cunnilingus. Count 9 involved an act of fellatio when the applicant was 19 to 20 years of age. The sentence in respect of Count 10 was for a term of 6 months which, as noted above, was wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed with respect to Count 8.

66An examination of each of the sentences imposed in respect of Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 could not, in my assessment, be considered manifestly excessive even by reference to historical sentencing patterns.

67Counts 7 and 8 were particularly serious offences. As previously observed, four offences of indecent assault on the Form 1 were also taken into account. The maximum penalty, as noted earlier, for the offences the subject of Counts 7 and 8 was penal servitude for life. Count 7 involved an offence that inflicted pain on the victim. She endeavoured to escape but was restrained by the applicant. The applicant persisted even though the victim was distressed and crying. The Crown submitted, and I agree, that this offence was a heinous one. The applicant was 16 to 18 years of age in the relevant time period. At age 16, the victim was then 7 years of age.

68The applicant then continued to offend on a regular basis after the Count 7 offence: Agreed Facts at [37].

69In relation to the Count 8 offence, which was committed on a day between 1 February 1980 and 1 July 1982, the applicant was then aged 16 to 19 years, and the victim 7 to 9 years. The applicant demanded that the victim comply with his demands and had sexual intercourse with the victim.

70The sentencing judge properly, with respect, found the most serious offences were the carnal knowledge offences -Counts 7 and 8.

71The written submissions for the applicant detailed a number of sentencing cases, some of which were said to be comparable cases covering offences for the period in question. It was submitted that the sentencing judge erred in imposing sentences that were manifestly excessive and this occurred because whilst her Honour said that she was sentencing the applicant in accordance with the sentencing practice of the 1970s, the sentences imposed were in fact more consistent with the current sentencing patterns.

72I, with respect, disagree. The circumstances in this case, including the very young age of the victim (as compared with the ages of the victims in many of the cases said to be comparable cases), the large disparity in age range between the victim and the applicant, the fact of the offences occurring in a context of the applicant's on-going sexual misconduct throughout the relevant period, the multiplicity of the offences charged and bringing into account the Form 1 matters (all of which involved grave misconduct) and the well above mid-range objective seriousness of the Counts 7 and 8 offences all, in my opinion, indicate that the sentences were well within range and were not manifestly excessive. I have earlier made observations about the structuring of the sentences. That, in my opinion, reinforces the conclusion that the sentences imposed were well within the range of available sentences. Ground 5 should be dismissed.

73I accordingly propose the following orders:

(1) Leave to appeal be granted.
(2) Appeal be dismissed.

		25 July 2014",2014-07-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2764423,R v Crispe [2014] NSWDC 196,"Judgment

1Tricia Crispe was called for trial before me this morning. She was charged by indictment with wounding Phillip Crispe with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and, as an alternative charge, of recklessly wounding Phillip Crispe. She pleaded not guilty. 
2Mr P Thompson, who appears as the prosecutor, mentioned the question of Ms Crispe's fitness to plead. Mr Schaudin of counsel, who appears for Ms Crispe, and Mr Thompson both told me that there was medical material to be tendered concerning Ms Crispe's fitness for trial.
3It seemed to me, in light of what Mr Thompson and Mr Schauden said, that there was a question raised about Ms Crispe's ""unfitness to be tried for an offence"". I am referring to s 5 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW). In accordance with s 10(1)(b) of that Act, I must conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether Ms Crispe is unfit to be tried for the offence.
4I am of the view that the question has been raised in good faith. There is nothing to suggest otherwise and indeed, the medical material which I have read this morning confirms that. 
5I commenced the inquiry this morning by asking Ms Crispe some questions. As a result of her answers to those questions, I am satisfied that Ms Crispe understands what she is charged with. I am satisfied that she is able to plead to the charge and understands generally the nature of the criminal proceedings which are brought against her. She understands my role in determining the case in what is, I understand, likely to be a judge alone trial.I am satisfied that she will be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in a general sense. I asked her to read, between the adjournment this morning and now, the early afternoon, the statements which will be tendered against her in the proceedings. I have just now asked her whether she has read those and she did. I am satisfied, as a result of what she has told me, that she is able to understand the substantial effect of what is said against her; that is, the evidence which will be tendered against her.
6I am satisfied that she understands the basis of a defence, which I am told she is to make, and that she is able to give appropriate instructions to her counsel. As a result of the exchange between her and me, I am satisfied that if she were called to give evidence, that she would be able to give an account consistent with her defence. I am satisfied that she has sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence she will rely on and to make that defence and her version of facts known to the Court and to her counsel.
7The matters which I have just referred to are those set out in the classic common law test for assessing a person's fitness for trial. The case is Regina v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48. In addition, I have read material which was made available to me by Mr Thompson, which includes medical evidence.
There are reports from two consultant forensic psychiatrists. Dr Stephen Allnutt saw Ms Crispe on 25 October last year. Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion as a result of that consultation, and material which he was supplied, that ""she is fit to stand trial according to Presser criteria"". Dr Allnutt expressed that opinion after assessing the various criteria and commenting on them. Dr Richard Furst saw Ms Crispe on 4 March last year. After reviewing the criteria for assessing fitness, he too expressed ""the opinion that Ms Crispe was fit to be tried"".
8Because both of those psychiatrists expressed their opinions based upon consultations last year, I engaged Ms Crispe directly by asking her the questions which I have referred to and which are recorded in the transcript. 
9I have invited both Mr Thompson and Mr Schauden to address me, and neither of them have asked to do that. I can understand why. The proceedings are, after all, ""not to be conducted in an adversary manner"" as provided for by s 12(2) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. There is no onus on either the prosecution or the defence.
10Having examined myself the criteria set out in Presser and assessed the information which I have referred to, I am of the opinion that Patricia Crispe is fit to be tried for the offences that she is charged with.
